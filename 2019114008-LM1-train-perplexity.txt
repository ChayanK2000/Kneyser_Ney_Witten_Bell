Chicken pox varicella.	19.057967288388205

Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster VZV.	4.3583064171203585

Fever and eruption of a special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox.	4.92316795555592

A virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops.	4.831818172798472

It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox.	4.244333271114688

It can also spread through a direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds.	4.481385966564112

In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby.	4.369833019596086

Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i.e.till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started.	3.6580860737889784

Fever , shivering , nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms , eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles.	4.429924352339264

Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes.	5.630412131187933

Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this.	4.6825079319359055

Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion.	4.628422504509127

Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle.	4.316058475466707

The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests.	3.916126112403712

Every disease occurs due to a type of virus.	11.572578877088628

Virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope.	6.622855084525428

If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person.	7.203668773398379

After about 4 to 14 days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person.	6.990000214657995

HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs.	6.749541416942574

The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted.	5.029496330087307

The results of infection are different and unexpected.	4.870709109599201

The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system.	5.673219281341333

Hepatitis-B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV.	5.213537160801073

In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis-B victimises more people to death in the whole year.	4.982087934630735

Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis-B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included.	4.011128429432358

HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person.	5.342095517703349

The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis-B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination.	3.612208716548549

With extensive use of hepatitis-B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis-B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis-B.	4.301425495377285

What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again ?.	5.866080494271141

The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence.	5.392484701175629

The family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of 1952.	4.712925308625785

On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo Egypt in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare.	3.43628040146555

All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services.	4.567175612582275

Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born.	4.09112322506046

Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India.	5.348627120129026

This program has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state.	4.813764981560075

Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh.	5.046487309410136

Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951-1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976-1981 and during the years of 1994-2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only.	3.7241861900277256

Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar.	5.044838472935596

Gross reproduction rate the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971-76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3.3.	4.799820996109885

Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period.	5.73010443299661

Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas.	4.063254058458787

It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state.	4.4539771676625985

Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas.	5.061627592641217

A little less than half of the mothers 46 percent give birth to more than 3 kids.	4.535619342495967

About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger.	5.363762977836038

It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular.	3.312800790892764

According to the estimates of Sample Registration System S.R.S.the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9.	3.8504883355039126

The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate 68.	5.287755575714795

Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births.	6.071659724647658

Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available.	7.881008773703693

Non-communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization.	4.53197102680191

The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate.	3.0051222922314733

Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb.	6.573563227074996

If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication.	5.359583723643652

If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing.	3.9068974097936198

Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly.	4.793541983052498

Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage.	5.327008906870295

Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients.	4.777593659941421

During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well.	4.010005642152579

The period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease.	5.078990477710383

Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining.	4.377536710890243

Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth.	5.332463968242588

Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps.	5.951496671582094

Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths.	5.313754348738856

Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while.	5.376657753117376

The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules.The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children.	4.112980879223527

About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly.	4.301773799792853

When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened.	4.029463715529205

Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR.	5.703053924333361

MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine.	5.412962728285017

The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective.	4.928054264887204

Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life.	5.156396642062978

Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy.	6.351098394909014

However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme.	4.423966151871911

The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles.	4.91361538483231

Therefore now it is recommended by both W.H.O.and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles.	3.804156859919629

Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel.	6.428869279752898

Such a system of brain is called mental disorder.	6.797865093403132

It is estimated that 1-2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease.	4.817585465132806

It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill.	5.007891863029031

Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality.	3.695362787140972

Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease.	5.823460046352718

Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries.	4.323369784661366

Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him can be seen and then his physical and mental test is done.	4.121008219439453

If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done.	3.33821699347658

Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods.	7.777669185468721

Listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health.	5.971451376202956

The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows.	3.3083391150969357

The following programs are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services.	3.807917561388453

A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre-delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level.	4.395471696966857

The percentage of the women getting the pre-delivery test done thrice is only 18.	5.118441035997265

There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre-delivery services in the urban and the rural areas.	3.543060748731926

More than three fourth of the women 78 percent in the urban areas gets the pre-delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so.	4.012607933027308

A little more than one third 39 percent of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills.	4.913447529612879

In cases of tetanus toxide injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T.T., however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent.	4.32760603008466

Generally there is much less vogue of pre-delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service -.	3.927419984210048

Indicating pregnant women.	29.48466858299235

Distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases.	4.686444805111343

There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand.	5.801726644945615

This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives.	4.367099618729208

Even in urban areas more than half 56 percent of childbirths takes place at home.	5.037802553592253

In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives.	4.141025254841143

Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth 14 percent is benefitted with post-labour tests within two months.	3.656269022436344

Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin-A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion.	3.6675218033868218

A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001-2002 , 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 has been shown in the following table.	4.294773499649961

The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans.	4.974674872712475

This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person.	5.519319493315882

However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth.	6.3938635787484

Polio disease particularly attacks young children.	8.122516160549244

80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age.	4.566641433081665

Polio is an extremely contagious disease.	9.026292471473921

Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities.	4.208807919572216

Oral Poliovirus Vaccine OPV was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union.	5.884323693312956

As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries.	3.5161664485104187

The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world.	3.4410462556063544

The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful.	5.315936790233678

Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help.	3.8116171342670033

By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis.	4.323169248281698

Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose.	6.2412164206233145

Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less.	4.576068868757455

Sex related diseases are contagious diseases.This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one 's sex partner during sexual intercourse.	4.762098604941649

This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy.	4.228097860263657

Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy.	8.31242792767726

The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia.	5.666712371704443

Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment.	5.017534139432781

Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all.	4.606097500941109

Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children.	3.8670393999289496

Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen between naval and the reproductive organs.	4.9501853908226225

Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women.	5.349497973576211

Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting.	4.295751874918016

Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs.	5.167644311184304

If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them.	5.690818096742259

Dead birth due to inborn syphilis.	8.179155716102233

The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases.	6.503562828354452

Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction.	9.458439620325507

Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye.	8.44773052224602

Contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease.	6.380064700414884

The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease.	5.282223843428494

Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs.	4.1643974163638156

Keep away from uncommon sexual relations.	6.718634162752462

Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse.	6.742760179348437

HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases.	7.373428624392177

It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities.	5.0860422320005325

Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed.	4.942371938203444

Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment.	4.943777700178116

Tuberculosis is a contagious disease.	8.763238563573928

Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis.	9.54872713456543

The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex.	5.649501565660794

A tuberculosis patient can infect 10-15 persons in a year.	6.376564822422112

About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases.	4.686296807210843

Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes.	5.861949873792734

This disease is found commonly in the lungs.	5.4489543165429914

In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease.	4.4433883993163805

Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much.	4.76843102498796

The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much.People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done.	4.399365917638679

In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis.	4.602214572232954

According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year.	4.730086081110508

The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India.	6.282172928907879

Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac.	4.127800874208047

The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined.	4.623049481622076

This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis.	4.120384980266195

In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times.	5.139746003843528

Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy.	6.745339689573518

Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis of the lungs.	5.744810469990522

The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm.	4.979891369197421

The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing.	6.233478938454042

The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis.	5.4191883812672605

Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X-ray is also used if necessary.	5.602133943553987

List of training test centres where cancer can be tested.	3.1363303443433597

Tuberculosis can be completely cured.	10.399878650679392

If the patient does the treatment regularly.	9.131688486254506

There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment.	4.653488496264501

Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy.	5.305656939700029

In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers.	5.450796625166165

Which is called DOTS Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy.	3.168706558545097

As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti-tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker.	3.2788692401969306

There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis.	7.7310115230756

Intensive phase which goes on for 2-3 months.	9.60645390295629

Continuation phase is of 4-5 months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking.	6.929907692567903

Under this program these medicines are taken thrice a week on alternate days for 2-3 months intensive phase.	4.756665399574765

After this phlegm is tested which if found negative , the patient is issued anti-tuberculosis drugs once in a week in the calendared multi-blistered combo pack.	3.980327452419873

Remember , the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker.	5.569662730912071

During the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete.	5.385293399742817

You will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase.	5.755218245074549

The best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient can not infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take DOTS after the three phlegm test.	4.2402416818135

Yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease.	6.379157784988322

Yellow fever is supposed to be the cause of several epidemics.	6.1315722429024175

Yellow fever occurs due to an arbovirus of the family of flaviviridae.	6.526129722193994

Arbovirus is a gram positive single-formula RNA virus.	6.583534829844682

Like malaria this virus also enters into humans through mosquito saliva.	5.3226560723026175

The mosquitoes that spread yellow fever aedes simpsaloni , aedes africanus and aedes aegypti.	4.265062961219778

Children can be saved from tuberculosis by administering BCG vaccine.	6.711079595717107

Vaccine must be administered after birth as early as possible.	6.139339115686709

Refer the patient for treatment to the near primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center.	3.97251563879348

Send the persons having cough with phlegm or without phlegm or phlegm with blood for three weeks or more to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for tests.	3.374125942187635

Keep enquiring about the tuberculosis patients whether they went to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for advice or not.	3.126638096410277

You must get all the babies of the area vaccinated for BCG with the help of the health workers women.	4.469876570683959

Educate people all about the prevention of tuberculosis and controlling it.	7.0319152438414845

Two medicine stores - Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar - have been built in the state to distribute medicines.	4.41832928311718

So that the medicines could be made available to far-off districts in time.	4.324464214121002

Supply of medicines is done by the Government of India.	6.018177010546986

To run Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme properly a four-wheeler vehicle has been made available by the Government of India in 8 districts Tehri , Paudi , Uttarkashi , Chamoli , Nainital , Pithauragarh , Almora and Dehradun.	3.2733055268404048

Each treatment centres has been provided with a two-wheeler by the Government of India.	3.9383310197284156

Each Microscopic Centre has been provided with one binocular microscope.	5.353863735877892

5 districts Haridwar , Udham Singh Nagar , Rudraprayag , Bageshwar and Champawat have been provided with four wheeler vehicle by the State Government.	3.5398927621867675

Tetanus is a type of infection which occurs due to such bacteria that are found in dust , dirt and rusted metals.	6.228800349900876

Muscles convulse because of the bacteria.	17.741590543544465

If the bacteria attack the muscles of the jaws then jaws convulse and the mouth neither opens nor it closes.	4.228224129059803

Generally it is very fast but some of its slow cases shows up when a person is already infected with a flavivirus.	5.147543713378177

After the infection the virus at first increases its number by reproducing locally , after that it spreads throughout the body through lymph carrying arteries.	4.2190073953772425

The muscle of the breathing pipe also convulse due to tetanus.	5.456575454318713

This is a kind of bacteria that closes the lungs with phlegm a kind of sticky , wet material due to which such an acute sound comes out on coughing as if a dog is barking.	4.124474716161866

The start of yellow fever starts suddenly 3 to 5 days after the infection.	6.9147210544477105

Because of bacteria such organisms may also emerge that causes pneumonia and bronchitis infection of the lungs.	4.688692147514914

Typhoid fever is such a disease that starts as an infection in the gastrointestinal passage and takes the form of a full-fledged disease.	4.9413950545915055

The cause of typhoid is a type of insect that is called salmonella typhi.	5.2791694872057375

Each patient has different symptoms of it but some symptoms are included in common symptoms - periodic fever , headache , tiredness and weakness , change in behavior and stomach problems in the initial stage of the disease and constipation followed by loose motion.	4.092913371381615

When any food item or beverage with salmonella typhi is taken then generally most of organic constituents become inactive by the presence of the acid present in the abdomen.	3.9011893525483163

If these insects reach the abdomen in great numbers then some of these insects reach the small intestine.	4.2022314634558136

Vaccine is the most effective and reliable solution for safety for typhoid fever.	6.29810412942038

Typhoid vaccination is recommended by different international and national health officers for persons traveling the regional areas.	4.213497318586771

This vaccination is also recommended for school children and youth and adults as well in the areas where typhoid fever is present as a major public health problem in the persons of that age group.	4.0651468078828294

Salmonella typhi with antibiotic resistance is found in typhoid fever.	8.082291316936317

This is how you should take care of your teeth.	7.577241847561929

High fever , cold , bleeding from skin , high heart pulse , headache , waist pain and diabetes occur in serious cases of yellow fever.	4.322857891662658

The death rate goes up to 85 % on the spread of yellow fever as an epidemic.	5.103433802672446

Yellow fever disease spreads in different ways in the rural and jungle areas and in the urban areas.	4.695583154387656

Desire has control on brain and desire works according to the dictates of pride.	6.131441164829259

Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all.	7.4779675718042595

With the increase of the effect of desire or pride on intelligence , the mental balance disrupts , mental frenzy and tension get incentive and as a result psychological disorders occur.	3.742172476598146

Due to this reason man does not stay fit for social life.	4.925589543524156

With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders.	4.551512749876737

This is the reason why together with consumption of nutritive food , excellent digestive capacity is given boundless importance in Ayurveda.	3.687640659855119

Renowned Yoga and spiritual Deepak Chopra considers ' radiation and life ' also important together with brilliance for mental health.	4.092096086177359

According to Dr.Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body.	4.324080566420539

Radiation is that inner physical strength which by increasing our comprehension power helps us in taking the right decision.	4.659016861519173

Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders.	5.575597063995042

In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc.	3.572276216437521

If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc.	3.9475964699531647

The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now.	3.3024443280678986

Dr.Deepak Chopra says , ' the greatest effect of our mental health is seen on our body '.	4.785113846744783

In the same way the good and bad effects of physical health can be seen on the brain.	5.095158966874529

In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain.	4.455193838548027

Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice.	4.936366064049006

After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery.	4.81958344463508

He had also heard something about hernia.	6.338104624893561

According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc.	5.128829480849791

Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur.	4.2552118349738794

The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct.	4.784389450159508

Surgery is its only cure and the more the delay the more increased would be the discomfort.	5.432761789084525

After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away.	4.246644520760656

He got the surgery done afterwards according to his physician ' s consultation or stayed in the maze of third or fourth opinion , I do not have any information of this.	3.942621876056613

It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan.	3.450130950671644

Like the disease hernia construction of a saclike creation takes place from the swelling of tissues in any particular organ of the patient due to genetic or any other reason.	4.2943521600609245

Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach.	4.722437914005856

That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach.	4.6923670184918045

But in the essay we will discuss in the context of hernia of stomach.	4.0973777941664045

There are three main kinds of this type of hernia too - inguinal hernia affecting the groin region , umbilical hernia affecting the navel region and incisional area rising at the place of surgery of stomach.	3.5209123737329593

Inguinal Hernia : This is a swelling connected to the inguinal canal on the inner walls of stomach and therefore it has been given the name of inguinal hernia.	5.367190030495603

The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia.	6.675841261995233

It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction.	4.3225362955088995

The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common.	4.025507774005275

Umbilical hernia is related to stomach.	8.393728587868834

Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia.	4.610910026454398

Umbilical hernia is generally due to congenital disorders.	7.229849261423069

In fact one hole of the stomach wall which is connected to the umbilical nerve often gets closed before birth.	4.9298911563512435

In some cases this does not happen because of which hernia erupts near navel center.	5.382547825891605

If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years.	5.059761677200976

Large sized hernia which does not stop on their own , surgery is important for their treatment.	6.672565764946704

This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child.	7.356348408250801

In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth.	4.49560470892207

But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak.	5.867274773880257

Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high.	6.263270259622317

Incisional hernia : A large population has to cross small surgical process of the stomach.	5.523659877050152

Due to the reason of this surgery for the cracks to appear in the walls of stomach is also common.	4.614882393770568

Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high.	4.7395693517454

2 to 10 percent cases of a few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type.	5.961522771294869

This problem can occur due to any one or many of the reasons like congenital reasons , due to increasing age , as a result of surgery , strain in muscles during pregnancy , reducing weight fast for decreasing obesity , diseases like marfan syndrome etc.	4.099965346805733

It is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia.	6.396676864691217

During the examination of the swelled surface in the affected areas one gets to see swelling or rise.	4.415854469407998

In affected areas the complaint of pain can also occur.	8.667879168283651

Swelling increases on putting more pressure while lifting weight , micturition or defecation.	5.0614976646892025

The pain occurring due to the reason of hernia is very intense.	6.030289831178418

The intensity of pain increases immensely after physical labor or as the day ends.	4.373229050235332

It is not difficult to recognize the symptoms of hernia.	5.088898547967204

Generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient , his family history and the examination of regions like groin , navel etc.	4.251463961258815

Apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor.	4.9869554382425685

Where making estimation of the disease is difficult there advice is given to get ultrasound or CAT scan done.	5.845339188485078

The aforesaid tests are often important for testing the chances of hydrosil.	6.569481860451425

The only possible treatment of hernia is surgery itself.	4.13525706490071

Riddance from this problem can be obtained only through surgery.	9.14443105393024

Famous by the name of hernioplasty this surgery is also done with the help of laparoscopy , endoscopy etc.	4.667376884178936

For the treatment of hernia the method of surgery which is brought into maximum use these days , that surgery is laparoscopy.	4.924471697239394

Due to being minimal invasive surgery , the surgery is done by putting an incision of only 2 - 3 mm to the patient.	4.756414435294444

As a result the patient starts walking after few hours of surgery.	5.0535594296477635

He gets working in normal way after just two - three days of surgery and within 5 to 7 days he gets to his daily works.	4.6424139142222165

Under this technique of surgery , a laparoscope fixed with microscopic camera is made to enter the region of hernia through a small tube.	4.128194506394141

Surgeon gets helped by means of camera in seeing hernia and the adjoining regions on the video screen.	4.346825971040866

By means of another tube entered inside the stomach the surgeon rectifies hernia.	5.883649173415369

The rectification of hernia is done through the posterior part of walls of stomach.	5.661184059824368

A netted mesh is sewn on the destroyed area of hernia and this way riddance is got from the problem.	4.72926410983987

With the help of laparoscopy hernia is almost a completely safe process.	4.4160983478414115

Yes , in approximately ten percent cases small complications after surgery are certainly got to be seen.	4.3869189628286795

Generally during hernioplasty there is a danger of infection in the region of surgery , destruction in the adjoining blood vessels and nerves and harm to the nearby organs , etc.	4.788994450237597

Where the presence of experienced doctor reduces its danger to minimum there a well equipped hospital is capable of controlling them in a better way in case of complication.	4.584157144715445

As I told you earlier , the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery and because of techniques of minimum incision it is also very safe.	4.679812027782454

But from fear of surgery or considering hernia as a less serious disease can put the patient ' s life at risk.	5.084085722340178

It is worth mentioning that hernia is such a problem which does not get cured on its own and it keeps on increasing with time.	4.994317936304261

If it is left to increase this way then its rectification through surgery becomes comparatively more difficult.	4.182081463227851

In the situation of no treatment supply of blood gets affected due to blood vessels being pressed or due to obstruction especially in veins because of which there is danger of ischamial nephrosis and gangrene.	3.677107899190612

Because of hernia due to obstruction in intestines the flow of matter present in them stops.	4.998715924006499

Consequently tightness , vomiting , release of gas , actions like discharge of faeces may get affected and immediate surgery becomes essential.	4.380683786367462

In some cases the work efficiency of the organ affected with hernia or its nearby organs get affected and other physical complications start increasing.	3.975709719956294

With no treatment the danger of hydrosil to happen from hernia can also be there.	6.190901327082586

Therefore do not delay in hernia.	6.408874883101066

With delay not just the danger of life risk would increase but comparatively there would also be problems in surgery.	5.46030045995511

Diabetes is not a disease which happens only to aged and obese people.	6.201213325302691

The treatment of diabetes mellitus sugar found in urine occurring in children is far more difficult because the treatment of children is done especially by keeping in mind their physical and emotional condition.	4.991602448633977

In diabetes the quantity of sugar in blood increases immensely because the body fails to produce the insulin being secreted from pancreas.	5.133567119355582

Diabetes is of two types.	5.102071759398889

At some point of time type 1 diabetes was called ' juvenile onset diabetes '.	5.2875648671138515

This is that condition of patient when the insulin is secreted less or not secreted at all.because the immune system attacks the cells of pancreas.	4.6611498946464

This disease may occur with great speed in the age of 6 to 13 years.	5.290672858190898

In type 2 diabetes the body does not stay sensitive to the insulin produced inside it.	5.846959991400266

This disease occurs in extremely obese teenagers who have this disease in their family.	5.549422024038189

Type 2 diabetes grows gradually.	12.60721567478061

The symptoms of Type 2 diabetes are frequent micturition , drinking lots of water , dryness of throat , laziness , high pulse rate and blurred vision.	3.496668622990687

The cure of the disease is ascertained by the test of urine and fasting blood sugar more than 126 mg.	6.057702052052661

For the parents who have children with diabetes keeping their children away from sweets and apart from taking samples to monitor blood sugar seeing them getting injected to take insulin may seem to be very painful but this may have to be done several times in a day.	3.491483429535145

In such situation they can get great relief from counselling.	5.0965035690240885

You should consider diabetes as an obstinate problem and not a disease whose cure will surely be found some time or the other.	3.8944220581086917

The teachers , family members and kin members should also be aware of his disease.	5.917646834616915

The young people can fight the disease by taking medicines as advised by the doctor and bringing change in the lifestyle.	5.010932252600161

For this they should reform the eating pattern , reduce weight and do exercise.	4.457805913224612

Keep in mind that you have to make your diabetic child as self - dependent as possible so that for him taking injection becomes as easy as brushing teeth.	3.6661604675385475

He can learn to do all these on his own by the time he is of 10 years of age.	4.737431467020562

When does eye problem occur ?.	10.934181968276741

If your child has a problem in doing school work.	5.744110852672862

If he feels pain in eyes , throbbing pain or tiredness.	6.643280352206775

He does not see the writing on the black board clearly.	5.019684340223059

If he brings his book very close to eyes while reading the book.	4.735593824781165

Then take him to an eye specialist immediately.	9.1010265189709

Often the teachers of children detect such problems on seeing and make you cautious.	4.607355956233935

Important information connected to antibiotic.	9.16713913257955

If your doctor asks you to keep an eye on the symptoms of the disease for 48 hours then follow his advice.	4.817569463687903

If you are said that the child has to take antibiotics for 5 days and in three days only all the symptoms of disease vanish then also do not stop taking medicine before the completion of 5 days.	4.877009484910434

This way by stopping the medicine in between the immune capacity of bacteria increases , consequently that problem can again start to grow.	4.780580652732692

Bhringraj is also called bhangra.	17.300058663030175

The very small plant of bhringraj is 10 - 12 fingers long.	6.202591296096643

Bhangra is spread on the ground.	10.065721262546596

The plant of bhangra grows there where water keeps flowing.	4.296560486311577

The plant of bhangra is found in great numbers on the banks of streams and rivers.	4.142420099007981

The small flowers of bhringraj are white in color.	4.155485898568359

The small flowers of bhringraj are seen from March till September.	3.736547948017371

Bhringraj is found in the entire India.	12.539746790772382

The use of the juice of the leaves and branches of bhringraj is very beneficial for the diseases of hair.	5.173407844017709

One drinks this especially while balding or premature greying of hair.	4.72490350403972

And this is applied on the balding region.	7.644088831147295

It is also used in the form of chemical.	6.264083857468669

Migraine is a neurobiological disorder.	8.422014465430983

The pain of migraine can arise any time in head.	5.01291602182047

Generally school going girls and working women are more prone to this.	5.433716755103743

Headache is indeed a very common problem.	9.175454670221098

When the pain is only in half of the head then it is called half headache or migraine.	6.928693369947567

This is one of the most common disorders.	6.495921941771616

Starting from above the eye it becomes constant at a place on the head.	6.39578327083608

Or goes to the posterior side of the head.	8.81048468721013

One - third people only take its treatment.	7.460713881814615

And half of them leave the treatment in between.	8.079023424031906

Why does it occur ?.	11.987084840381952

If the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time , this treatment in itself is satisfactory.	4.553913816814928

There is a knot , and therefore it has to be removed , it is not necessary.	5.046950368050143

If the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously , if the woman is panicking , the symptoms increase , the symptoms of bleeding , pain and pressure appear , then only it should be removed.	4.637123392569367

If the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy.	3.972914324715566

The fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers.	6.76926380048715

There are two types of operations for fibroid.	5.753374634033783

Myomactomy removal of knot only , this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy opening stomach.	4.67412013448579

Just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children.	5.811582442997349

Hysterectomy : If the age is not less , the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor.	4.281870069279543

Medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia.	5.787940189465601

Some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid.	6.396389194474074

But due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced.	6.671216932834558

The condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine.	6.914235724584748

The modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis through laser Nd-YYAG.	5.75026330510226

The blocking of uterine artery ambolization.	9.114273506539146

In modern treatment the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl particles or gel foam powder through a pipe entered through the thigh artery after anaesthesising it.	2.791578983660693

By blocking the uterine artery the blood supply available to the tumor gets obstructed and the tumor reduces up to 60 %.	4.56631962309586

A skilful gynaecologist is capable of doing proper treatment after considering everything.	5.777458624814855

Therefore , it is unnecessary to be scared of leiomyoma disease.	4.649499174842381

The investigation of the secrets of brain -.	7.183586313524691

If we gradually cut open with a saw and separate the upper part of the skull of a man after making him unconscious on an operation table then by peering inside we can ourselves see the live brain with our own eyes.	3.533071644954942

Similarly , neuro-surgeons operate the brain by cutting the skull bones with saw and drill.	4.610298770160506

Bacterial dysentery occurs from a special type of bacteria bacilli.	8.540403162260509

Many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it.	4.403502475904198

Through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself Einstein , C.V.Raman , Tagore and Shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas.	3.4642557556684

By look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity.	5.555264586088684

On investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell , neuron or nerve cell.	5.09226321567153

In bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm.	4.369198103785309

Disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment.	5.123924954870094

The disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in India.	5.1693054201616935

In the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and a very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell.	4.8325632459123335

In women , men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner.	5.1066892381959175

By disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them.	4.021985857537531

The matter which fascinated Kahal the most , that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells.	4.594964426684168

In this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell.	4.104778887515465

The axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains a certain distance between the two.	4.914778546164278

Kahal studied these network places with great minuteness , which later on were given the name of synapse by Sir Charles Sherrington.	4.571425461664121

How does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell ?.	5.033815834973636

There are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse.Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine.	3.4925294687467967

Consciously a valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over , it has to take the help of a chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded.	4.334918707926512

After all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system ?.	4.664071113763818

If we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only , not haphazard.	4.038820162507502

Every synapse gives unidirectional instruction , because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only.	4.41388428452008

In fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire.	3.9402226997046186

But the direction gets decided at every synapse , because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell.	4.203432252375123

Thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction.	4.157060347887966

Without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos.	3.757498908817417

The second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is a delay of approximately the thousandth part of a second or 1.0 milli second.	5.030350227801451

This way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time.	4.700332812713253

The more the synapses in a neuronal circuit , the slower would be the communication in them.	3.9469585258230557

Synapse has one more use as well.	8.577373822392786

Because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain.	4.449806106510233

These chemical substances are called medicines.	9.906878070913532

Many medicines given by the doctors today - like anaesthesia to make unconscious , tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace , and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only.	3.7250038837250914

Why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself , to understand it will not be now difficult.	4.850849681950609

Therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses.	4.985833557470235

The person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery.	5.599274171843945

Every cell in itself appears to be very simple as a unit , but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually.	4.20744113424811

Perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence , consciousness and memory.	4.420794396119882

From the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts.	3.279369002394034

Because of being enclosed in a box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep a direct contact with all the distant parts of the body.	4.7605255330722995

Therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important.	4.66338814651016

Like a thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back , spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones.	4.594948641807599

At regular interval , through the medium of 31 spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body.	4.696604553040272

Each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs , and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles.	3.8415010319649907

The spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis , it does not disturb the brain for everything.	4.682913695655496

For example , it maintains a proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect.	4.706306538349879

We withdraw hand when all of a sudden a pin pierces finger.	5.350308375003169

This reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord.	7.04270367214726

The simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only.	4.7646814283062175

Apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like a highway alone.	4.7315740223000375

Thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious.	4.265478981726415

But now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord.	4.9560842555310725

The brain starts just as we enter the head.	6.0056370985458845

Or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain.	6.940607121562576

On seeing it appears as if the brain is like a very big walnut resting on a strong stem or branch.	5.5087479909031325

Therefore we can divide the brain into 2 parts.	4.60179483988257

One is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it.	4.675833135152641

In fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord , and it is also situated in its straight line , but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively.	4.606447016598154

The various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone.	4.7572086417501875

Like , breathing , beating of heart , controlling of blood pressure , digestion of food etc..	6.015403243282352

A sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in a moment.	4.5384670182336135

But there is nothing to get scared in this.	5.7702817960025605

Nature has placed this very important control-room in a very safe place at the center of the head.	4.818872026912239

At times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely , and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged.	3.358494178422808

The ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death.	7.236458318114263

The same happens when the criminals are hanged.	5.856939316858243

Medulla alone is the originating place of 7 out of 12 cranial nerves as well.	5.035318078247036

The cranial nerves control the muscles of face , tongue , shoulders etc., bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs.	4.377425530507642

If we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and mid-brain come.	4.005263209915744

Mid-brain and pons mainly work as junction.	7.527439895708914

In a way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway.	4.322129473214514

Like a skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs.	4.855961404649128

First , because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags.	5.183492323123252

We do not fall even when fleeing , running , doing acrobats , bending forward - backward.	4.666612980878375

Second , this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely.	4.276990994947357

Cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions.	6.369533324838894

Earlier we mentioned 12 cranial nerves out of which 7 had their origin from medulla.	5.075196680492651

Similarly 4 more emanate from pons mid-brain.	6.495139457223476

Their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face.	5.6809048076311806

Now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain - cerebrum or fore-brain.	4.6214943629339595

From the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state.	5.918473152739987

From darkness to light.	14.046313907825192

We have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brain-stem or cerebellum.	6.0324484465376855

As if we are sleeping in a very deep sleep.	8.036600937155864

But just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake.	7.923322161578437

We start feeling comfort , sadness.	9.959611347920186

We feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like a machine.	5.400453865584231

We start saying I am there , I am doing , I am liking it.	4.586050254113916

Does any machine feel like this ?.	8.64813518224259

None of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours.	5.8840730917752575

Let us forget for a moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see.	3.8161717176649277

The brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both.	6.89198538807106

And why should not it be  After all both have to control respiration , heart , food , blood pressure etc..	4.491219048051072

While jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body.	5.406639378353421

But when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is a huge difference between mouse and man.	4.712046157926399

Our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain.	5.163728518118697

Because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body.	4.858718580233722

Although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours.	4.353071882090113

The weight of brain of our closest relative , monkeys , is just half a kilogram.	4.523631567152268

The weight of the brain of whale is 8000th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around 50th part of the weight of our body.	4.918650972743316

If the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than 150 times of the brain of whale.	4.522825911044953

There is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been a riddle for us even now.	5.288564906590686

This is divided into two parts , which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres.	5.336661887186629

Strange thing is this , that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body.	4.580510578879862

All the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side.	4.0983940015925935

This very system is found in all the organisms.	10.532478793801944

The effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body.	5.94979181701359

Similarly , on pricking a needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere.	5.478371286084963

Like a modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in a very good manner.	4.834410512252954

The upper thick surface of 3 mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only.	3.9560807591236915

In the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread.	4.2993427503973125

The small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle.	4.65355485327256

The most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision , while a very small part at the center does hearing.	5.085642650576047

The system of olfaction is at the lower surface.	7.137270416519215

But we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain.	4.588612348670558

Only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves.	5.020252399052682

So who is seeing , hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum ?.	6.409828975250635

Is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain ?.	5.2833877405206815

This is a complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed.	3.638527266720077

Approximately 1 cm wide and 6 cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called ` motor cortex ' and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone.	4.630665548713837

The representation of body here also is inverted only : head down and legs up.	4.870411547950228

What is the secret behind this chaotic system , even no one knows this nicely.	4.059734958301742

It can happen that one day you may solve this mystery.	5.311411906609966

A similar strip near the motor cortex is called ` sensory cortex ' where all the sensations from the other half of the body come.	4.841171931312414

But if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed.	4.039048284699879

Then only we realize pain.	9.00983643969865

The pain is in finger , this is only a natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger.	4.766129583035663

Roughly we can conclude this , that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system.	5.131306748976158

If the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted.	5.115052274587688

Similarly , the moment a nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment.	3.9628457321548254

We can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like.	5.978134887130092

This is called paralysis.	10.434718265408023

Only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut.	5.320480956753402

Similarly , now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain.	4.810864873505937

Similarly , we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs.	5.129206523802526

In today 's mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life.	3.9640391660298597

We say that heart is like a pump , eyes like a camera , nerves are like electric wires.and brain ?.	4.525870934054738

Quickly the answer would be that the brain is a computer.	7.11749184771009

Today at every place , whether classroom or shop , office or home , the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations.	3.8928667124719323

We have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers.	4.763271691061676

Our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication , division , addition and subtraction.	4.543713210279908

But are the methods of both same ?.	8.216789135209599

In future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us ?.	4.069003491133847

Does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big , or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate ?.	4.485820498626857

Such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance.	6.787305080533764

In the efforts to solve the questions , on one the hand the development of computers is getting a lot of help as well.	4.677992187212764

Right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in a better way.	5.001226751011268

Due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in a better way we should first make its small and simple model.	3.966085186607559

In schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes , steam engines , radio etc.so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these.	3.6580239124780864

Why not we study a small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain ?.	3.9637451851842855

We should make a child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work , multiply 9 by 9 , and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with 9 again.	3.748458293469076

The computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off.	5.36568259976013

But the child will throw away his paper and pencil in a few minutes and will in fact start questioning you , oh , why are you making me do this useless work.	3.7695622224426453

What does this mean : I am tired , leave , I will not do anymore.	4.606756017836474

If we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes , while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer.	3.8895713376968337

The child soon gets bored with useless work.	5.305277890699875

There is unlimited variation in his thinking , not definiteness like computer.	4.668382886893353

He will suddenly find out a new solution to any question which no one had told him before.	4.5368413788315

Will any computer start thinking about gravitation like Newton when an apple falls on it ?.	4.570910895060728

Or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like Darwin ?.	4.558200022347742

One more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone , not in computer.	5.139880172525733

Many times we commit such mistakes while speaking.	6.110190143965331

The professor of Oxford William Spooner is very famous for this.	5.013818134453746

Thus it is also called spoonerism.	12.404607866173418

At present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain.	4.529931116144981

If we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions.	4.138553581694271

It is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence , consciousness , prudence etc to which the best of today 's computers have not been able to reach.	4.71728767479177

In future it will ever be able to reach , there is doubt in it.	5.612677755649752

But there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain , and here lies its actual usefulness.	4.682594674309791

The computer can do any calculation very fast , while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil.	3.885395185777413

The computer which plays chess made by Dr Hans Berliner selects the most suitable move from 175000 moves on analyzing them in just 1 second.	3.3687282022256615

Till that time we will not even be able to count up to five.	7.489603120259562

That is why in controlling fast moving spaceships , rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer.	3.6141135899743477

Similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them.	4.308281458283266

Now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects.	4.114780514124731

In one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only.	4.822765795769002

The way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette.	3.965887250569757

But if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken ?.	3.889626956009722

Is it therefore that we have to spend 20-25 years on education in schools and colleges ?.	5.0141586257782675

No matter how advanced or clever the computer is , it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn.	3.7640558305377634

Whether 2 has to be added to 2 or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science , our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them.	4.02813396461288

Our brain has programmed the computer , but who programs our brain ?.	4.663504193929899

Opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned anti-reflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain , that is , cerebrum.	4.480414482452671

Therefore these have the maximum importance in man.	6.210390726244883

By making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other.	3.288581165349516

Pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education.	6.558976336015087

Perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through a systematic language.	3.980482349706678

First we point to a child a moving elephant on a road and say that see that is elephant.	4.344663741044068

Then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it.	4.689886235760618

Finally , only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain.	4.584823845914533

Is it not a matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge , black quadruple having long trunks.	3.918648393030506

It seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain.	4.521806706043664

Can the present human society be imagined without language ?.	5.307686663735392

Is science , history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language , or not make them permanent by writing ?.	4.272855732866312

Scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language , but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them.	4.030192274239711

In the past few years Roger Sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain.	3.4631171029464425

While receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm on December 8 , 1981 he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them.	3.8042775067109083

When there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosum-the bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle , so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side.	3.6191257907444534

The daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results.	4.634515152918921

Though we certainly get description of two-headed animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will a person with two brains or split brain think actually.	3.5858506204031153

In the words of Roger Sperry if a person with split brain attended a party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him.	3.772312980109596

Both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body.	3.633351792331291

But after an in-depth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is a huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres.	4.409175599100665

Everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal.	6.584464947377918

In maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous.	4.793741257683652

The same thing has also been seen in all the animals.	7.566620681742663

It can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective , and like a class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere.	4.611940835611619

If we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this -.	3.650573742186968

Left hemisphere - language speaking , cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard , maths , analysis of problems , estimation of time.	3.783361591354882

Right hemisphere - geometry , painting , instrumental music , organization of facts , estimation of space.	4.293075146030286

Whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division.	5.2476183826380325

But because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed.	4.545786659895963

On the contrary the matter of the patients of Roger Sperry is in fact indeed exquisite.	5.257503420187861

As a simple example if a pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded.	4.214515249030145

The contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin.	5.217354862756034

With how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments !.	4.151676951172596

One attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth.	5.162447809608286

In any huge class some students would be uncommon.	5.363888893109668

That is , instead of playing , writing , eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand.	4.389545898540081

These left handed players however have a distinct grandeur in cricket.	4.765367037589816

What is their ratio in your school or classroom ?.	5.6917371884855585

In what subjects do they get more marks : Or in what do they take more interest : How is their speaking ability.	3.986117777895662

If we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys , small kids and adults in this respect.	4.079683237807131

But firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale.	6.1955073822024875

To reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this.	4.7729142388268055

Breast cancer is a scary name for women.	5.003012089385832

Thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days.	4.796091940453587

Maximum succumb financially to breast cancer.	7.476365892964748

The patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery.	4.522924672794807

If cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity , even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent.	4.1145679785590845

This way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture.	3.6398792708703835

In contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits.	5.676881509818919

Many methods of cancer detection like mammography , MRI , CT scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible.	3.8921348167437424

In such situation the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography.	2.733883124515581

In infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays.	4.2571911677748595

Greek and Egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body.	4.701257588194592

Sir William Herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in 1800.	5.000378603013062

But till 1970 it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine.	3.8065051673685133

On passing the rays through the prism , the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light.	4.609395325451926

In this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately.	3.5761004228648092

This ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ.	6.236682371827246

Electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments.	4.940317310748923

Different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition , which on recognition the disease is diagnosed.	5.595985440970148

Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment.	4.328713599971581

Of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important.	5.5345389872496735

Because of less information in it , it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography.	5.34884889919127

Lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography.	4.773452547349337

The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc..	3.786736518046899

Several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes a very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases.	4.67390368961622

Any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called STD , that is , sexually transmitted disease.	4.297177184673424

Neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from STD.	9.034259765497819

Some infections together with the complications related to womb , disease of liver may even lead to HIV AIDS.	5.467966438753395

There are approximately 20 types of sexually transmitted infections.	6.5334758186511435

STD spreads through bacteria , parasites and virus.	8.536732645739814

Out of them some of the STD which spread rapidly are as following.	4.880701091635686

HPV , that is , human pappiloma virus is a viral disease.	5.3747905365448085

HPV disease engulfs around 80 % of the total people who make physical relations.	6.175676378057558

The infection of HPV is of more than 100 types and 3 types of infections out of these spread through sex.	4.905075611921796

HPV infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women.	5.391950423775634

On being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus , hips or neck.	4.265438853248964

For protection from HPV infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible.	4.176829572113121

Even if you make relations then also use latex condoms.	5.589552057409303

Complete riddance from HPV infection can not however be obtained.	5.972442513175387

But by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief.	5.429913440027344

Genital herpes is also a viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners.	6.1831646890523855

Genital herpes is of two types.	5.945253219129039

After the genital herpes infection , inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus , which causes pain.	4.0611609275489915

Genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching.	5.930580062012519

Apart from this , in women , this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge.	4.951047071054967

In order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners.	3.4705334983206195

Even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection.	4.857722818712811

If pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby.	4.654261361549041

Syphilis is a bacterial infection.	12.412327879996315

Syphilis affects lips , mouth , kidneys and genitals.	7.706371448555938

Apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her child.	4.751707218710555

In the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain.	5.1385182748340466

At times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all.	5.573843667158114

Many times people ignore it.	8.153597659216421

These inflammations are not permanent , that is , they keep coming and going.	5.642322273675268

Therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years.	6.193769244828503

Apart from diseases like AIDS , syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness , mental imbalance and heart attack.	4.755634686660839

Many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection.	6.008599385707888

If you are infected and pregnant , then you can even lose the child.	5.906401809159284

For safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also.	5.047865026133498

Get the infection checked at regular intervals.	6.017633230584978

If the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done.	5.616941759289074

With the help of injection one can control it within 24 hours.	4.570362132395517

Tykomonosis infection spreads through a parasite.	11.703793648820911

The main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women.	5.425912294043247

Apart from this , itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also a common symptom.	4.709033603659282

There are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men.	5.412205703807774

But many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis.	4.709555115308304

Pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly.	5.614816320498302

According to Dr Preeti maximum STD are bacterial.	5.002506680101204

For safety against STD , If together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased.	4.363727498071917

Health and regular check up -.	14.266235599039886

Generally most of the women do not get regular checkups , because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards.	7.403013602631366

Generally , in girls , pap starts occurring after the age of 15 years.	4.169988643772015

The white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap.	5.010723857892973

It is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of 12 years.	4.37042696127872

The pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of 40 years.	4.768405194041032

But still , on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of 30 years.	4.254003105182189

Pap test is of two types.	7.67753280750422

Leukoria test is done to find about common infections.	8.044306987555359

Leukoria test completely depends on physical relations.	6.505917332817536

Those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex , they do not need the leukoria test a great deal.	4.3312449446267145

Pap infection test is also of two types.	8.443818926085257

One , which is a simple test , with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled.	6.021972360965685

Second , ` hyper plasia ' is the second important test for pap infection.	5.601003738794485

With ` hyper plasia ' pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not.	5.066825451796936

The doctors generally advise for ` hyper plasia ' test to women of 40 years.	4.7609538757540735

The homeopathic doctor Minu Mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of 30 years.	3.3946699732896333

Though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer.	4.069723985851889

Liquid pap test is done for this.	9.932990182409204

Breast cancer is engulfing Indian women very fast.	5.242027555848908

According to a recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal , ignore it.	3.839250028624696

According to Dr Pankaj Kumar of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital , women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up.	3.492205316111492

Women of 20-29 years should get mammography done once every third year.	5.534947533888135

Not just this , together with this one should also do BSF or breast self exam.	4.856664407716304

Breast Self Exam should be started right after the age of 20 years.	4.488055681936345

Normally , doing BSF may keep you vigilant for breast cancer , but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node , unwanted pain or any type of secretion.	4.3073110902231075

The hormonal changes start happening after the age of 30 years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is a persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it.	5.348497006292929

Thus , getting ultrasound done every year is very important.	6.949104978352923

The treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this , on being diagnosed at the right time.	4.149193694819623

After an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done.	5.156610017776321

With the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test.	4.311493304600532

After its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not.	4.390528845601311

Though biopsy test is a part of your regular checkups , but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes , pain in the lower abdomen , sudden growth of hair on face , increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done.	4.122774709764236

Often after crossing 40 women stop paying attention towards their health.	4.549911675707053

They feel that now they do not need any regular checkups , but this is not proper.	5.675536299403261

There are many such diseases after 40 which may take awful shape on not taking precaution.	3.9361140951245894

The FSH test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started.	5.148292690396554

In FSH test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause.	5.762505930199795

Pelvic exam test must be done annually.	9.214893239816783

With the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus , reproductive organs , bladder etc can become known.	4.144445286217807

If any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test.	5.484863699600148

One 's cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining 45 years.	5.104372794576416

If you are less than 45 years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done.	3.8660898916862063

Not just this , if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after 40.	5.935118600888203

Maximum women in India give birth to children till the age of 30-35 years.	4.36496871114667

After delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity.	5.9814903273937565

Because of this a lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs.	5.6511744191340645

Although 60 years is the age for the test of osteoporosis , but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery.	4.595750824510284

Bone densitometry is also done for calcium.	10.235664820609998

By the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out.	5.8135027737117895

After the age of 45 years the danger of colon cancer increases in women.	6.265533211399119

Although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in India , but still regular checkups is important.	5.5549845648399385

Every year FOBT test should be done for colon cancer.	6.940869104923058

Sample of human fecus is taken in FOBT test.	7.508491745419797

After the FOBT test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc.is coming in your stomach or not.	4.752728016655004

Flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years.	6.7153482042653705

By flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver , stomach or reproductive organs.	4.6965286483098865

Colonoscopy must be done once every 10 years.	9.83846504945996

That is , one at 40 then second at 50 years of age.	4.6526735899557

There are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval.	3.949257586376534

These tests are - blood pressure , diabetes , depression and obesity fatness.	6.840567719146968

Poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes.	5.344911775056895

If the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases 8 times.	5.798707823605896

Because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled.	4.346325634761869

If you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of 120 increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast.	3.9493502167126198

It also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need.	4.8241558146013315

If in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted , without getting broken ?.	3.61680601540818

Many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette , chewing tobacco , obesity , eating excessive salt , mental disturbance , deficiency of physical labor , the elasticity of the vessels decrease , it starts contracting.	3.7413871399153824

This only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become a common disease today.	6.18673784069538

Nature has created our vessels only for bearing a certain pressure.	4.933314585743448

As a result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end : brain , heart and kidneys.	4.9720179133621984

But it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high.	5.168935468696483

Otherwise , first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure.	5.339660263829733

Impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body.	3.846074535267972

Both the main arteries open in the right auricle.	7.773580844263208

If we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing.	4.846870562580016

One tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries.	5.404783497615842

In short , the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty.	6.910276163910664

Medical surgery does this only.	11.386367202595942

If we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead.	4.012322670460472

Blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification.	5.655997274904757

Without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going.	5.6066844945091

Heart - lung-machine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only , by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible.	4.3874678123344095

The heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body.	5.717618078106387

The heart too needs fuel for its work.	6.194274100512019

The heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers.	5.530213067402785

Close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches.	5.103570713728654

Coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart.	6.703431037572038

The meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like a crown on the heart.	3.840412872942831

The amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with a crown.	5.8275871918470825

On the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack.	5.567485144472918

The collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs , getting reflected and taking a photograph of this is only called ultrasonography.	4.426189950006548

These days there is discussion about ultrasonography.	5.711459644281396

But the knowledge about the technique of USG started right from the beginning of this century.	5.362149835498224

It was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released.	4.699741055130014

Which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of USG.	4.521976773941448

In this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for a moment and then catches the reflected rays back.	3.5754999368127356

Instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate.	5.058791887409276

The popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of USG is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother.	5.698357462381854

But it is not like that.	5.932845722522152

Stomach is like a closed pouch , inside which gall bladder , liver , intestines , kidneys , lymph glands , spleen etc are situated.	4.016589873442331

Similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated.	5.4284019999385835

For the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special USG is important.	4.926961351212268

Normal or special USG save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery.	5.218284640543394

Liver is a very important organ of the body.	8.171460881888901

The more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them.	4.634896230484366

The infections of liver , cyst , normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer , the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound.	4.614431281439806

Similarly , if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer , then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound.	4.748723879699798

The kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart.	7.775783349121762

Because of the life-long working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive.	5.205915071788547

Whether there is kidney or not , if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst , stone , swelling , pus , this also is told to us by the ultrasound test.	4.00557857811232

Till some time ago in order to find this , X-ray was taken by injecting dye in blood , which used to take a lot of time and it was also painful.	5.08170902033972

The problem of thyroid gland is also very common.	8.49692645972971

For the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is a less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity.	3.933890190668767

The diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid , prostate , adrenal etc is possible through USG.	5.8331295966452075

One very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer.	6.4763494436193145

It is believed that U.S.G.mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular X-ray mammography.	3.606592162805417

It gives cure in 75-90 % cases.	9.831120905647602

USG mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity.	6.768941497429925

The extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere.	4.924978829892815

Whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not , whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing , all these are found from the USG test of the uterus.	4.2887564464766195

Many serious complications are found in the foetus like the non-formation of the head or even the water getting filled in it hydrocephalous etc..	5.46533811966633

Ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems.	9.773503913681802

Apart from the correct information about the foetus , one more important information which found through USG is in the matter of placenta.	4.591987498231664

The properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta.	5.208981322088259

By ultrasound all the deformities can be detected , the status of the placenta , any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc..	4.875459807865915

By which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus.	5.1647550827546596

By USG that is , ultrasonography a lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine.	5.34909321900683

Very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs.	4.7128727241215165

So important , simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for a hideous work.	4.509398728758088

Every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus.	4.444597390480404

In some form or the other we participate in the pre-delivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons.	4.16868985774106

Because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight.	4.657471546153577

On getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be a congenital disease or a disease occurring after a year of birth.	5.103459336256383

The rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries.	5.990686412552508

According to the Blind Control in India there are 1,20,00,000 blind people in the country out of which 80 % people are victims of cataract.	4.78152992490443

Though this blindness can be rectified through surgery.	5.828268743088725

The natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases.	5.009711971327711

This is called white cataract.	8.258463798137225

In the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles.	4.514488428836169

After a condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles.	6.044893497232351

At present the only permanent solution for this is surgery.	6.061677782300114

To make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable a very new technique has been developed which is called ` phaco emulsification ' technique.	4.728814189611492

To take out the cataract with the help of the technique of ` phaco emulsification ' a small incision of 3 mm is made.	4.713552383934253

Through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye.	4.775252912126078

Now through this small incision a foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye.	4.737115636129729

Since this incision is very small , therefore there is no need to put suture to this.	5.010335837142469

Thus , it is called the suture less surgery.	8.334956912719498

The special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after a day.	5.016540558235373

He is finally given the number of spectacles after a week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months.	4.726057411025491

The surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care.	5.989912534842103

To do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes , both hands and both legs.	4.599015467738885

One leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes.	4.6845212040407525

One hand handles the needle of phaco machine , the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument.	4.680826502092535

Therefore , ` phaco emulsification ' technique is costlier than normal surgeries.	5.844831972245267

Phaco machine is proving to be a boon for the patients of cataract.	6.982637302135423

The surgery done by phaco machine is easy , painless and can be done in less time.	5.149464067529421

You can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part.	5.19647887322893

Especially , such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus.	4.960609869000125

More than 50 lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number.	4.847174550751584

Till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that.	4.546453150924246

But now a technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery.	5.875651970545392

The technique of lithoptysis was used in 1980 for the first time and from 1987 it has become available in India as well.	4.526126218243422

In the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves.	4.21596888020303

The pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine.	5.411305372563033

Today it has gained credibility as the most safe , simple and theoretical procedure.	4.546698145458114

If the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is a need of some common blood and urine tests , X-rays of the kidneys and IBP X-ray.	4.967213915676331

Generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process.	5.080741266324846

The action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by a sleep inducing injection.	4.157885024317741

The time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number.	5.255144332025233

Generally this is done in one episode.	10.061774462362633

One episode in this is of 30-40 minutes and a gap of 4 days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body.	4.264443443184969

When these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced.	6.119000027672556

Some patients may be feeling slight piercing , but there is no pain.	5.093750184782227

Most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment.	6.5498334377476235

As an exception , one may have to be put under vigilance for 24 hours.	5.2069925220061375

Post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after 3 months.	7.5055673457493635

Then by taking a new X-ray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not.	4.80940055191668

Since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been 8-10 years , information about its long term effects have not been gathered.	4.462873516057987

Approximately 90 % of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis.	7.525047523893549

In some the action may have to be repeated twice or more.	6.248745970267959

The expense at every sitting amounts to nearly 8 thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor.	3.71636968577385

Presently , this facility is available in 30-35 cities in our country.	6.912732044047135

In lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision.	7.261032880219372

You can start the normal daily life in a week.	5.58944794748211

The action can be repeated if the stone forms again.	5.970021890533081

The technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged , patients of diabetes , blood pressure or heart disease.	4.242423462660336

The problem of uncontrolled micturition -.	7.863656690744385

in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening.	6.097280050197343

The tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small.	6.242719769330782

Babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine.	5.558437801895374

Maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only.	6.209763185093345

They stop wetting clothes and bed.	8.705808292307408

Not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women.	5.145072063625137

It has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be 5 to 7 % in the age group of 15-44 years , 8 to 15 % in age group of 45-64 years of age and 16 to 20 % in women of 65 years and more.	4.446687963902476

The complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women.	4.753806582687014

Permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment.	7.438241027916754

Urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder , urinary system , when there is tension due to coughing , sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes.	3.995308014390589

The most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage.	6.917348589416559

If the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled.	4.310121512012174

This problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder.	6.491683741232952

But in several women its cause is not diagnosed.	6.126698064944888

This problem may occur in some due to mental tension.	5.760386797644427

Women often try to control urine for long time.	5.148661022730358

The urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less.	4.036847348474902

If from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum fistula or genitals then also the problem may arise.	5.050028286088203

There is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex , long stuck delivery.	4.753199054230019

Though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret , but the treatment of this problem is possible.	6.611134644496391

The doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests.	5.005101566405399

To find out the reasons , the help of tests like the test of urine , bed rest , measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder , the speed of the flow of urine , the pressure of the leakage of urine , ultrasound , x-ray , CT scan etc is taken.	4.218983645219355

The solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause.	8.124537203918276

If the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast.	5.077917663806073

If there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery.	3.5328066517855263

If there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it.	5.9449368154226985

If the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved.	4.618286623406326

If the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques , medicine and surgery.	4.8549359760463195

If not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water , liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity.	5.357304737720211

Do not consume tea , coffee , carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it.	4.281741537068127

Reduce the weight if the weight is excessive.	8.942463694903664

If infested with any type of allergy , cough , constipation then get the treatment done.	6.03353102176943

Do exercise of pelvis and stomach.	8.737443288182709

Mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination.	6.230918759964375

Tension , worry are lethal for the physical and mental health.	5.680062624318715

Stay away from these as much as possible , live life happily , free of tension and worry.	4.838923862790032

In these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure , coughing , sneezing.	5.330661986437057

If relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis.	4.940307467011835

Various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients.	7.372013952721555

Similarly , plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube.	4.212396067721508

If relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery.	3.987454959667318

This is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination.	4.1893288678725416

If this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then a proper treatment of disease is essential.	7.00730816585242

If the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination.	4.262970703929744

Stop urine for a definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to 3-4 hours gradually , do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it.	3.973116313251789

Control on urine is done through the medium of brain , spinal cord and nerves.	6.497860533078167

If the will power is made strong , the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that I am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained.	4.172315462022154

Around 85 % also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves.	6.3512948434563645

Many medicines are available as solution to these types of problems.	6.787404734502809

They are advised to take anti-cholinergic or anti-depressant medicines.	4.764656472434168

Problem in the outflow of urine on excessive filling of urine in urinary bladder , obstruction in passage , damage of the nervous system , consumption of antipsoric medicine or mental tension , may be the reasons of habit.	4.1052287194637

By finding the root cause treatment should be done.	7.436226628508148

If the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting a tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery.	3.872291374178206

Unable to keep control on urination , self leaking , feeling hasty , is a common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this.	5.282301455987628

The complication of leaking of urine on exerting pressure may occur in 20 to 40 % adult females.	4.843489787171006

But the problem is not untreatable , women can become problem free by changing the life style , habits , doing exercise of hips and pelvis , medicine , treatment by surgery and other techniques.	3.8667361899942945

Therefore these should not hesitate , should not feel embarrassed , should lead a healthy , normal life after getting treated by taking advice from a skilled doctor.	4.1112133573532

This discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place , drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly.	3.2703032045333593

Slight dirt , showing carelessness in hygiene , wearing dirty panty repeatedly or wearing wet panty give birth to urine infection and may give discomfort of many days to the person.	3.775410851896778

Therefore , every person should stay beware of it.	7.262354226254133

ప్రత్యేకంగా/RB మహిళలుకి/N_NN వారి/PR_PRP శరీర/JJ శుభ్రతపై/N_NN ఎక్కువ/RB శ్రద్ధ/RB పెట్తవలెను/V_VM_VF ./RD_PUNC 	3.653180394667948

Those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once.	4.808268890322577

When the menstruation stops after the age of 50-52.	8.042720814220642

After the age of 50-52 the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this , then the chance of infection increases very much.	4.417737476346183

The distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort.	4.61164038581319

In urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation.	6.674632530070869

The stream of urine being distorted and not straight , intense burning sensation around the place of urine , onset of fever.	4.280079057578067

In the condition of less urination the doctor puts a urinary bladder and tube.	4.973300463707876

The reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of E.Coli bacteria.	5.059955511536576

Not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract , wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible.	3.7993420277212575

After intercourse with husband the vaginal tract must be cleaned with water till inside so that inner cleanliness is maintained.	4.2519008856520575

Light , easily digestible food , carrot , papaya , cucumber , gourd , guava etc should be eaten a lot in food so that the stomach should remain clean and there should not be any constipation.	5.1310294170664035

Lots of water should be consumed.	9.719429998034146

The cancer of skin is generally of three types.	6.219250666501265

Squamous cell cancer , basal cell cancer , melanin cell cancer.	6.395896842610006

The melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above.	7.33661552397194

While basal cell cancer is the least dangerous.	7.875975849365654

The cancer of skin generally appears in the form of a small tumor.	4.65549275686408

This tumor can appear on any part of the body.	5.695381075266374

Like hand , leg , face etc..	7.70266842853997

The tumor can be of normal color or of black color.	4.40177344766944

In the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake , because there is no pain in the tumor.	4.36192399452254

Therefore , the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor.	7.025149458699437

When the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer.	5.588405114175588

Which has spread in other parts of the body as well.	4.942876805517234

The problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain.	4.699091713764643

The patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain.	6.9123390996245275

The cancer of the wound increases and a stage comes when pain starts occurring in that.	4.003070288204142

But by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body.	3.8011336231975323

At times cancer appears in hairless tumors.	6.401904779896716

Therefore , do not forget any tumor.	6.664539210829044

No matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors , this is not known.	4.8478842983035815

Still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms.	4.67559407370644

Formation of wound in the tumor , rapid growth of tumor , pain in the tumor , change of color in the tumor.	6.069903191592199

If any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor.	3.644989927468557

Cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels : the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful.	3.7501406520924045

Because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body.	5.581642449197268

Definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin.	4.75413674110035

The infected person gets fever of 104 degree Fahrenheit or more and he also feels cold with this.	5.51255095905037

Headache and vomiting starts happening.	11.689618676302402

Breathing becomes difficult in the patient.	11.064706935258558

The symptoms like pneumonia appear.	10.285830917290891

The one who is attacked dies in three - six days.	5.01003361948757

In the whole world there is a situation of illusion regarding the patients and the symptoms of SARS.	7.689866975397777

Thus , Suspect Case and Probable Case have been defined.	5.688554793523665

The formula to stay constantly healthy.	9.191906517639724

Uncountable types of bacteria and virus are spread in our atmosphere.	6.342753700827569

By the medium of our breath we pull in thousands of bacteria and virus with the air into our body and then also they do not have any ill effect on our body.	4.4838158326984985

At times when our immune system falls weak due to some reason then only we become infested with flu or cough-cold or any other disease or allergy.	4.339004097185556

With food also we make several disease bearer microbes reach our body.	4.900334189565483

Such microbes mostly die when coming in contact with the saliva of our mouth or else the acid of our stomach.	4.683359712592353

If by any reason this does not happen in the body of any person then he is troubled by the poisoning of the food.	4.89722393577382

How does the immune system work ?.	10.008365141222956

At first the body protects us from the external disease causing agents.	5.083335684725641

A type of antibacterial substance continues to be produced on our skin by coming in contact of which there is destruction of various types of disease causing bacteria and microbes.	5.332367617452496

The nature protects us by other means as well.	5.304593410404936

Our mouth , nose and eyes also become the way of entry into the body for the microbes.	6.70592824579565

A layer of mucous is spread over the nasal cavity and the lungs.	5.286145184027784

The microbes which do not die immediately , they become inactive on sticking with the mucous.	4.854043167474088

There is a type of enzyme in the mucous and the tear that flows from our eyes which is called ` lysosome '.	4.804167401964808

Lysosome by breaking the wall of the cell destroys the disease causing bacteria.	6.493993339448944

The beneficial bacteria named ` lactobacillus ' staying in the intestines and genitals saves us from yeast and the other harmful microbes.	5.240557606233209

If by any reason any antigen like the disease causing bacteria , virus , fungus , parasite or any other external substance enter in the body by penetrating the upper protective shield then the immunity action of cells and humoral begins.	3.9153494233581942

The scientists believe that apart from the other parts there are three different types of cells and three other soluble proteins in the immunity system.	5.033217185898997

The cells and proteins can be seen in the blood flowing in our body.	5.866254224428597

The cells and proteins together become capable of initiating the immunity activity.	3.919327784439626

There are three main types of cells - red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes , white blood corpuscles or leukocytes and platelets or thrombocytes that is , the cells which coagulate the blood.	3.5443331404019998

Worm - this is a common disease in children.	13.868268548400945

Objectively the worms are of several types - round worm , magnetic worm , thread worm , tape worm and other diseases of worm.	4.433483161612254

Round worm affects children the most.	11.385592791583992

The symptoms of round worm.	8.348462839082478

Less hunger , stomach pain , mild fever , chattering of teeth , micturition in bed , cough , itching in anus and many other abnormal symptoms are of worms.	4.341309895828036

At times the round worms come together as a unit and produce obstruction in the intestines.	4.148715106725768

Because of round worm there may be pain in the stomach and vomiting.	7.461424226070083

The hook worms get stuck to the intestine and they reduce blood there by sucking it from there.	5.155082054937655

The eggs of round worm reach the intestines through polluted food and blood.	5.0657791972746615

The round worm become the cause of several symptoms after maturing.	6.213495225344772

The eggs of hook worms hatch on warm and wet ground and their embryos reach the thin blood vessels by penetrating the bare feet of human body.	3.4048140226103807

Tape worm reaches the body by eating contaminated meat.	9.14463593358247

Their diagnosis is possible by stool examination.	8.666788538127195

Similarly , naru is also a type of contagious disease which occurs by drinking unclean water of ponds , lakes , tanks etc..	5.335791041620534

Thus , naru disease is generally found more in rural population.	7.283869106389625

The naru worms reach the digestive system by drinking contaminated water where the naru worms come out of the Cyclopes and enter the tissues of the skin and begin to grow.	4.517991127610133

The worm generally produces a wart in that part of the body which often comes in contact with water.	5.9660704389014905

In such situation the naru worm releases its larva in the water.	3.952098369242077

The symptoms occurring due to naru worms are generally seen in the lower part of the body.	4.776312679700507

The part of the body where the worms come out , there is intense itching and then inflammation occurs and then a hole forms.	4.775835613618146

Because of this the symptoms of high fever , headache and vomiting appear.	7.580901270427736

In order to prevent naru disease the water of tanks , lakes and ponds etc should be used only after filtering.	4.818664285024318

The diagnosis of naru disease can also be done by putting some chemical injections in bone marrow.	4.84496896419956

The disease which spread through the microbes related to water -.	5.240597586856333

In this disease several types of malaria , filaria , dengue and yellow fever etc.are included.	4.471097792821176

The disease of malaria spreads from one person to the other through a total of four sub species of mosquitoes named plasmodium falciparum , plasmodium vivax , plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malaria.	3.2103536010827343

In the symptoms of malaria there is high fever , nausea , headache and very profuse sweating.	5.214934796802167

By affecting the pancreas and nervous system malaria becomes the reason of loss of consciousness and at times death.	5.250228367009605

Generally the mosquitoes bite at night.	6.435084896581537

The disease of filaria spreads because of the bite of mosquitoes named culecs pipians at night.	4.412803116783171

Dengue , yellow fever and other microbial infection spreads through another sub species of mosquito named andes egyptys.	4.550266243341859

In the chemical composing of water the roles of nitrate , fluoride and arsenic are very important in the ascertainment of the suitability of the drinking water.	3.482346752922386

But its high density may lead to the growth of various lethal diseases in the ling run.	5.132667169172257

Or it enters our body through the medium of water and then it gets converted to nitrite.	6.3945699069854465

This nitrite again reacts with diamine , amide and carbonate and forms n-nitroso compound which is very cancerous.	4.018891777240674

For the ascertainment of the suitability of fluoride rich drinks the role of fluoride is also very important.	4.270073944427773

On consumption of long term or excessive fluoride rich water , many types of disease occur in man and cattle.	4.979101915752827

The disease occurring due to the excessiveness of fluoride is called ` fluorosis '.	6.3379222624530875

Polio eradication program : problem and solution.	8.8860738774093

Polio is such a disease which is not lethal but by making the people handicapped it makes them abnormal for the entire life.	5.305385781771788

In this disease affecting in childhood generally , the growth of legs stop and they are left small and thin.	5.07362981443804

Consequently polio infested person has to walk as a lame person or with the help of crutches for the whole life.	4.659217625786647

Often the patients of polio become fat when the age increases because of which their problems increase even further.	6.112025974412317

The reason of polio disease is polio mellitus virus.	6.21201824472034

In order to free India from polio mellitus virus and to save people from becoming victims of polio in thousands of number every year , the pulse polio program was started by the World Health Organisation which was established in April 7 1948.	3.4872415631478844

The pulse polio program was started on an experimental basis for the first time in Delhi in 1994-95.	4.001217994197591

Being encouraged of the reach of pulse polio and the support received to the pulse polio in Delhi this program was executed in the whole country in 1995-96.	4.511402943799127

Till now there have been several rounds of pulse polio program in the whole country.	4.551764384057763

The main aim of pulse polio has been only this that no child should be left devoid of taking polio vaccine in hilly places , desert places , forest areas or in any far distanced places.	3.7328533791419827

The pulse polio program will continue for three more years now.	4.908280603782108

As a result of the comprehensive mission for the eradication of polio in 1998 the number of new cases in the whole country has only been 1934.	3.9491388689522435

Even after that because of the continuing pulse polio program the number of new cases in 1999 came down to 1126.	5.026779606291056

In 2000 this number had reached to 265 and by October 2001 only 100 new cases came within the grasp of polio.	4.037361058804148

At the same time in 2001 there were only six such states where new cases of polio were witnessed.	3.680833234423344

Out of these more in Uttar Pradesh 82 cases and after that 13 cases in Bihar had come forward.	4.4720069614259375

The government had organised the pulse polio vaccination day only twice in 2001 but due to the increase of the number of polio cases to 1630 now the polio vaccination is being done 6 times.	4.672041538194789

Till May 10th , 2003 whatever cases were registered for polio in the whole country , the maximum 24 out of them were found Uttar Pradesh and 23 were found in Bengal.	4.291650144771623

Apart from these 8 in Bihar , 7 in Madhya Pradesh , 4 in Rajasthan and 3 in Delhi are included.	3.8793460296579196

By August 21 , 2004 a total of 34 cases had come forward in the country , out of which 20 were of Uttar Pradesh , 7 of Bihar , 2 of Maharashtra and one case each of Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Delhi , Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.	3.3601296061522805

The government had aimed to eradicate polio from the country by 2007.	4.550099010968865

On September 6 , 2007 a case of 11 month old girl has come forward in Jabalpur.	5.2260766136454615

There has been increase in the type of P3 polio and P1 type of polio has also not been destroyed from the roots.	4.674457879546746

In 2007 1,389 cases were registered in the whole world out of which 864 cases were found in India.	5.944262726697751

It is known that because of the increase of the cases of polio in India , it has to face criticism from those countries of the world who have eradicated the disease of polio within them.	4.918600608370606

According to the Ministry of the Centre for Family Welfare the virus of polio has now become limited to some selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.	3.440639559463366

Because the virus of polio is found only in the body of human beings its complete eradication is possible.	5.32198716840489

For this in order to ascertain the abundance of substances antibody to fight against polio in human body dose of two drops of sobin vaccine is given through mouth and the dose of Salk vaccine is given through injection under polio immunity vaccine.	3.6987872666049677

India is a country of huge population.	9.053358921636287

70 percent population of the country stays in rural areas where the health services present are of extremely low standard.	4.815718309390112

This is the reason that the infant mortality rate is very high in India.	4.641545904300235

Although the reasons for infant mortality are various and different.	5.601109060807389

Pulse Polio Mission is a national health safety child mission under the Family Welfare department of Indian Government in which in order to keep children of less than 5 years polio free medicine is made to drink free of cost.	3.803606356200279

The main purpose of pulse polio mission is to make the children free from physical handicap.	4.681312319543085

The main base of this mission is to make the pulse polio mission reach to every house and giving the medicine vaccine to each child up to 5 years.	4.056926509473159

For which the Indian government makes the mass aware through the medium of advertisement.	5.65028472472597

Pulse Polio Mission is actually a team work in which there is equal contribution of each member.	4.773163124176352

According to the survey of the World Health Organisation more than 15 crore people fall ill due to malaria every year and more than 50 lac patients die.	3.8434174986845666

Malaria epidemic is a contagious disease.	7.432289643201927

Malaria spreads from mosquito named female anopheles.	7.051522116005036

Mosquitoes are omnipresent and diseases like dengue , chickengunia and filaria eliphantiasis also occur from these.	4.841955206174668

In malaria disease fever comes following chills and also following sweating.	4.803824532580452

10 -14 days after the biting of the mosquito the symptoms become visible and the person falls sick.	5.078506018940357

Because of being an infectious disease it can also occur from one person to the other person.	4.379651723029231

Apart from chill there is also vomiting in malaria.	7.554836913944883

There is intense headache in malaria.	6.297822084966793

The patient may even die if the treatment is not done immediately , because by this the fever rises up to 106 degree Fahrenheit.	5.186473751722204

After the infection there is lack of blood in the body of the person and the liver and spleen grow large.	4.767686960473471

Abortion may also occur in pregnant women due to malaria.	7.918863745422312

Female anopheles mosquito lays its eggs in stagnant water like ponds , lakes , wells , rivers , drains etc..	3.51451812543386

These eggs are very small and they keep floating on the surface of the water.	5.1493251522859875

Generally , the eggs and the larva which come out of the eggs thereafter get a place to hide behind the grass or the plants by the side of water.	4.035306512206216

Larva comes out of the egg in 24-28 hours of the laying of eggs.	6.7917866476734154

Larva gets converted to pupa in 5-6 days , which start taking dips in water.	4.837889215025449

In 2 or 3 days it flies away becoming an adult mosquito from pupa.	4.996027611168524

Adult mosquito rests at 45 degree angle from the surface.	6.391950576976046

This way while becoming mosquitoes from egg their enemy is gambusia fish which eats their eggs in the state of larva , pupa.	3.619913998378785

Tank kept open on the terrace near the house , useless thrown tyres , cooler , kitchen garden , fountains for decoration , pots and vases , broken vessels , uncovered vessels , disposable glasses , stagnant water near hand pump or tap , wells which are not brought into use , cistern of animals , the stagnant water in the paddy fields , the accumulated watering the monsoon season in the tantrum of the trees , the lakes surrounded with grass , marshy land and the stagnant water of the drains are the shelter place of the mosquitoes.	3.13267470933765

Malaria is an omnipresent problem.	9.61534016617661

There is no permanent solution to malaria and neither have the doctors of the world discovered its any inoculation.	4.494279926325365

Still for safety against mosquitoes you may get mosquito proof nets fixed on the windows and doors of your house.	3.5917599217772893

Certainly put mosquito net while sleeping at night.	4.600232944580704

Put the repellent cream on the uncovered parts of the body.	4.656207229656443

In the evening burn the smoke of the leaves of need or the incense stick which drives the mosquito away.	3.9072600622599594

Wear such clothes on body by which the whole body remains covered.	8.569278978413001

Least number of mosquitoes will bite by this.	7.955529236790512

In order to stop the breeding of mosquitoes do not let the water accumulate near the house , change the water of the cooler every week.	3.378893868704259

Do not let water accumulate in the broken vessels kept on the terrace.	4.582414156801591

Certainly put Gambusia fish in ponds , wells and lakes.	5.076077214027675

At the onset of malaria fever get the patient 's blood tested.	7.154457226165168

High blood pressure is dangerous for health -.	8.549937875281298

Blood pressure is not such an illness that can not be controlled.	6.738663850351411

By adopting a course of abstinence and medicines it is possible to prevent the serious consequences of blood pressure.	4.4481511921358905

Blood pumped from left chamber of the heart circulates in the arteries spread throughout the body and it is the very pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries by blood circulation which is called blood pressure.	5.817209767758882

The pressure generating in the systolic shrinking stage of heart is called systolic blood pressure and the pressure generating in the diastolic expanding stage of the heart , diastolic blood pressure.	4.406519066876315

The systolic blood pressure in a normal person is less than 140 m.m.and the diastolic blood pressure is less than 90 m.m.of mercury.	5.111632743156651

Blood pressure of a normal man should be less than 140  90.	7.262310004487501

We call it increasing situation of systolic blood pressure on systolic blood pressure going above 140 m.m.mercury and increasing situation of diastolic blood pressure on it going above 90 m.m.mercury.	3.35241763182066

In any person either of the two blood pressures the systolic or diastolic can mount up or both the blood pressures can increase together.	3.9208218048737997

These are all named high blood pressure.	5.770206149905856

For the health of a person it is necessary for his blood pressure to be normal.	7.026054341312017

There is pressure on heart as blood pressure mounts up and also there is adverse effect of it on the different parts of body.	4.656852716431993

Whenever there is decrease or increase in the pumping capacity of heart , there is a defect in valve of the heart , blockage in the main arteries emerging from the heart or vessels have contracted in the whole artery system and blood circulation is abnormal , then blood pressure starts mounting up.	5.022579064682861

Hormones oozing from some special endocrinal glands in the body also play an important role in the blood pressure increase.	6.607826989371842

Blood pressure also increases in case of disease in kidneys or their veins.	7.535535610367576

Such blood pressures are called renal blood pressure.	6.896379163932022

Though blood pressure can occur to anyone in any stage - children , youth , middle aged or aged , but generally disease of high blood pressure occurs more in individuals above 40 years of age.	3.974907385227679

In the last 2-3 decades changes brought about in lifestyle , food habits , a stressful lifestyle and a luxurious lifestyle which is increasingly becoming so on a daily basis have played an important role in increasing high blood pressure.	3.1462817068241438

Get these tests done in case of high blood pressure.	7.598056709420731

The general test of blood and urine.	11.67770972517319

Test of lipid profile.	11.82944407486971

The test of blood urea and creatinine.	7.417051815126294

Test of blood sugar.	14.798669672667275

Test of serum protein.	12.085534032574989

Test of E.C.G.and heart.	8.22099226165575

Diet of high blood pressure patients :.	11.932749031680112

Patients of high blood pressure should never use alcohol , cigarettes , tobacco , paan masalas.	4.288040035944283

Patients of high blood pressure should use less salt in eatables.	4.676139979125196

Patients of high blood pressure should not use much fat in food.	4.6321402416121105

For patients of high blood pressure mustard oil is a good option.	6.657853023539816

Patients of high blood pressure should consume fibrous eatables and green vegetables more in their food.	4.287167561084466

Instead of tensed , hectic , and tiring lifestyle patient of high blood pressure should adopt satisfactory system and must complete night sleep of 6 - 8 hours regularly.	3.731057273822105

Patients of high blood pressure should do light exercise on a regular basis or should develop a habit of strolling and walking for 30-40 minutes in the pure environment of morning.	3.9770533828784314

A collective feeling emerges in the patients of high blood pressure by contributing in the small domestic chores and the need for labor also gets fulfilled.	4.347701027068859

Medicines for high blood pressure :.	7.778129540630285

In the modern medical world best of the best medicines of high blood pressure are available but their use should be done with advice of the doctor.	4.120958773789194

Medicines of high blood pressure should be decreased - increased or stopped with the advice of an expert only.	5.1341459045121045

Sound sleep , balanced nutritious diet , daily routine , and light exercise play an important role in controlling high blood pressure.	4.107006289914413

The ` fast food culture ' growing in children and in the family is contributing a lot in promoting high blood pressure.	5.622683734548863

There is need of control on the high blood pressure increasing - ' fast food culture.'.	6.117425047122431

Causes of high blood pressure -.	7.949988394833084

Obesity : there is chance of high B.P.in more fat people.	5.714050541758599

Use of salt : use of much salt boosts high blood pressure.	4.9203273993404695

Some other elements : Potassium , Calcium , Magnesium , etc.are also some such elements that play their part in blood pressure.	4.786632148582843

Saturated fat : Its excess is an accessory to high blood pressure.	4.008844419553286

Wine : the use of it increases blood pressure.	11.192603707839352

Environmental pressure also encourages high blood pressure.	6.637870383804722

Contraceptive pills : An accessory to high blood pressure.	4.468038790104821

Genetic factor may also be a cause for blood pressure.	8.674004063232259

Harms of high blood pressure -.	10.550991076629158

Problems like heart attack , heart failure may occur due to high blood pressure.	4.075469818998618

Problems like kidney disease and kidney failure may occur due to high blood pressure.	4.199096887338586

Due to high blood pressure there is bad impact on the sensitive and important parts of body , among which the eye and the brain are mainly included.	5.1550812019354275

There could be an ill effect of high blood pressure on retina of the eye and disease like paralysis may also occur.	5.15193220424659

Diabetes : Appropriate lifestyle can also prevent from diabetes.	7.01368192059838

Diabetes occur due to increase in the amount of sugar in the body.	8.493260309409356

After being sick in diabetes its effect also befalls on other parts of our body with which other diseases also emerge.	4.868456247236263

On being afflicted with diabetes the amount of glucose in blood increases more than necessary.	4.830495842850622

In case of natural activity of insulin formation being closed in the body of the diseased person or the effect of its activity not occurring on the cells , parts of the body and tissues can not use glucose easily.	4.397790544574741

Entry of glucose is facilitated in the cells of human body through insulin and cells can use this glucose for energy and this glucose is made in the pancreas situated in the stomach.	4.771946234716486

Circulation of glucose in blood happens through the liver by which tissues like brain , muscles and fat are discharged.	4.96390793616065

On being afflicted with diabetes either insulin is produced in a very small amount in the body or its effect on our blood cells does n't occur in a suitable amount.	5.33709091486856

Diabetes has two prototypes :.	12.168276127191081

Type 1 Diabetes : which occurs chiefly in children and in less than 20 years of age.	4.813803400745537

In this the insulin factory shuts down and the need of insulin arises for the child afflicted with disease to stay alive.	5.206536605312011

Type 2 diabetes : This happens due to a person 's irregular lifestyle of which carelessness in diet , to keep sitting , body being bulky are main.	4.682271238022228

In fact , regular exercise in lifestyle , change in food habits , and by losing weight , danger of diabetes can be stopped.	4.140280630098333

By bringing a change in food habits and loss in weight , prevention of heart diseases related to diabetes can also be done.	5.993766600618801

In the treatment of diabetes , to follow food habits related remedies is very important.	5.159592048147096

In a situation of not complying with advice related to food habits , any amount of insulin or medicines can not help.	3.807858062601051

Generally , in the meals of Indians carbohydrates and vegetarian content is more in amount and use of fish is also done among the people of coastal region.	4.690833115560535

If still a prey to diabetes then the reason is this that they do n't have the right information about their diet.	5.162466351870858

For appropriate food habits or for preparation of a proper diet chart a diabetic patient should consult a dietician.	4.706767555930456

Gradually decrease the amount of calorie intake in food , better still reduce 500 calories every 3 weeks and how long can you continue decreasing it also depends on your body weight.	4.342432933041506

If you are vegetarian then increase the amount of fibrous food content in your food.	4.690813548189632

If you are a non-vegetarian then consume plentiful fish , and completely avoid vanaspati ghee.	3.845463158549069

Reduce the use of cooking oils also.	11.373679260324925

In organic fruits and vegetables quantity of anti-oxidants and minerals are more , which are beneficial for health.	5.145213528650709

Fish is also a great source of fatty acids.	10.522246734880598

Stop consumption of alcohol because by this also amount of sucrose in blood increases in a horrible manner.	5.813252837466563

Risks for diabetes :.	28.756953422561597

Family history of diabetes.	18.457355344715435

Increased body weight.	29.335767614707407

Weight of body should be according to body height.	7.65989315269328

By sitting around much also , weight increases.	6.304769428286521

Malnourishment in childhood  less body weight with birth.	7.859221667750315

Harmful effects of diabetes :.	16.203994849476146

Obesity , hyper lipidemia , high blood pressure , heart related diseases , stomach protruding out , increase in waist or hip size is also harmful.	4.736352998782741

Exercise : To keep the body fit and fine sugar should be used as less as possible and diabetes should be kept in control.	5.811821798286363

Walking around for 20-20 minutes at a fast pace at least thrice in a week is good.	6.586713176918392

Also remember this that exercising more than necessary can also cause harm.	6.140599593979423

Prostrate enlargement , a common problem of the middle aged -.	9.439493199934493

In people above the age of 50 years problem of B.P.H.is a common case.	6.269950157911635

For the treatment of B.P.H., in a new method of surgery T.U.R.P., neither a cut is needed to be made in the stomach nor does the patient has to stay in hospital for many days.	4.771789405828908

Prostrate gland made of muscles has a composition exactly like that of the shape of a shirt and surrounds the urinary passage like a collar.	4.76090123084957

In the prostrate gland milk like white fluid substance is made which is carrier of sperms.	4.571268042616315

With increase in age itself the size of prostrate gland also starts increasing.	5.330880725034536

The increased state of the prostrate gland is called B.P.H.	5.744444312222401

Although it is a natural condition of increasing age it is still a disease , which can affect our life and with which physical and mental problems both can happen to the patient.	4.737305057867895

In B.P.H.disease repeated urge to urinate is a common symptom so its reason is that prostrate gland is very close to the urinary bladder and stays surrounding the urinary passage.	4.198731352933351

When size of prostrate gland increases , its pressure is also exerted on the urinary passage due to which urinary passage contracts and becomes thin and small.	4.662690509508213

As a result , urine is able to come out easily and patient starts facing problems while urination.	5.112761864591823

Symptoms of B.P.H.disease :.	5.684373263392295

Because of swelling in prostrate gland and its increase in size two kinds of problems happen in urination.	4.7225479958357415

One , difficulty to urinate due to pressure in the line of flow of urine and second , due to contraction in urinary passage and accumulation of urine an infection happens in it.	4.166165457657467

After that there is swelling in the wall of the urinary bladder.	7.168054678568393

Due to these complications a variety of difficulties start happening to the patient.	4.591802683626925

Like repeated urge to defecate urine , urge to urinate at night , effort while urinating at start and not only this urinating drop by drop and having pain while urinating.	3.674259821379613

The complaint of pain occurs when there is infection in urine.	7.132487456328416

Because of this complaint of stoppage of urine also occurs and relief is felt only when rubber tube is applied to take out urine.	4.3716908770117575

In this type of patient there is difficulty to completely empty the bag of urine and after urinating also some amount of urine remains in the bag.	4.97550848747004

Treatment of B.P.H.disease :.	5.725234466386157

If much enlargement has not happened in the size of the prostrate then to do the treatment neither medicine is needed nor surgery.	4.91573483212367

In B.P.H.advice of drinking less water while sleeping at night is given.	5.047243109446581

If there is a habit of drinking alcohol then advice of leaving it is given.	5.249031575085954

Not only this , patient is also given advice to leave tea , coffee , etc..	5.5960410036318216

If after this also the patient does n't get relief then medicine is given to reduce action of muscles of prostrate gland.	5.3843267850835055

T.U.R.P : New method of surgery.	6.937400813042527

Nowadays treatment of prostrate is being done by many new methods whose names are , T.U.V.P., T.U.I.P.And T.U.R.P.	3.61438192694831

T.U.V.P., T.U.I.P.and T.U.R.P.there is no similarity in results in treatment through all three , that is why all are not popular together in these.	3.9285726705150665

Nowadays T.U.V.P are not in use.	6.599234868897794

On the other hand treatment of prostrate through the use of laser beams is being considered the first choice of therapists.	4.571747448317408

In the treatment of prostrate T.U.R.P is quite popular and most urologists are using this method.	4.456302009109

This is the reason that T.U.R.P.is called gold standard procedure.	3.718053181512413

After 72 hours discharge is given to the patient and only after a rest of 2-3 days patient can do his daily work.	5.077291266409546

In T.U.R.P method a telescope is made to enter through the urinary passage , and prostrate is seen through the help of a light and lens attached to it.	4.011473454875314

In T.U.R.P.method telescope stays attached to a video system.	4.04018030976333

There are many advantages of surgery by T.U.R.P.Method.	3.756647530702469

In surgery by T.U.R.P.method patient is given discharge from the hospital after 24 to 72 hours.	3.336749125266173

In surgery by T.U.R.P.method , necessity of making a cut in the stomach of patient is not needed.	4.367905912678202

In surgery by T.U.R.P method because of less time of the patient 's staying admitted chances of infection become quite reduced.	4.162892714577276

During surgery by T.U.R.P method there is less bleeding.	5.434375049960021

In surgery by T.U.R.P method patient recovers after only 2 to 3 days.	2.983599628946616

On treatment of prostrate by T.U.R.P.method , after a few days there is a complaint of clot of blood coming in urine of patient many times.	4.460366189283894

The complaint of appearance of clot of blood is a common problem which can be seen in a surgery of this kind.	5.587820240646755

This happens due to rupture of small blood vessels during surgery.	5.126872390275165

Secretion increases on blood pressure increasing extremely , getting a fit of cough or in a state of excessive infection.	5.464527360356824

If there is a mistake in detection of disease because of some reason then after later on it is prostrate cancer and its surgery is done.	4.453662148265231

In such a situation the part of place of surgery becomes stiff like stone.	3.843230110700073

The turning of the part of place of surgery becoming stiff like stone occurs because of cancer having spread reaching into the third stage.	4.468004195034878

When the growth of cancer reaches the fourth stage then it also takes the bones in its embrace.	4.950939416335168

The other problem of this surgery is that of the flow of urine becoming reduced.	5.654369662925597

To get rid of this problem therapist puts a rubber tube in the urinary passage of the patient that helps urinate.	5.03947946352634

After a few days tension in it goes away on its own because of the tube.	7.524482633745588

Increasing havoc of Asthma in childhood.	8.207920996179604

Asthma is a form of allergy.	9.269562916595119

In this the ultrasensitive breathing tubes contract on coming in contact with allergy-causing elements.	4.116284331240702

Due to this sound of whistle starts coming from chest.	5.480148562039096

Due to swelling in the mucous membrane of breathing tubes and increase in secretion of its glands problems like cough and phlegm also happen.	4.647654728984851

Due to contraction of breathing tubes in children during asthma , they have more distress as compared to elders.	5.246579041584127

The breathing tubes of children are thin and capacity of lungs is less.	6.063438519540638

In some children the symptoms of allergy start reducing on increase in age and they become healthy by the age of 4-5 years.	4.821182437215434

In some older children other than viral asthma attack can occur due to sensitivity towards smoke , tobacco smoke , cold , sun , etc.also.	3.874161930979477

In other children asthma attack can happen due to laughing and crying.	6.015588169205676

Gradually these children can become sensitive to dust , animal skin , fiber strands , hair , body waste etc.and on coming in contact with these asthma attack can occur.	3.6508694678803266

In some children attack occurs due to some specific food matter.	7.034128374612061

The main causes of asthma -.	8.560812552304258

To an extent allergy and asthma are also hereditary.	6.748748382017498

If parents are allergic then the chances of children being allergic are more.	6.164236319053259

Besides this on being hereditarily sensitive attack of asthma can occur on coming in contact with increasing polluted elements present in the environment , being allergic to smoke or other chemicals of motor vehicles and factories.	4.1646953557221655

Dirt , dust , smell of house , smoke of fuel can produce asthma attack in children.	5.254629906281339

The chances of city children versus village children to be asthmatic are more.	3.372654102734412

Environment of cities is more polluted.	9.21083880473169

The children whose guardians or other members of home smoke inside the house chances of those children to be asthmatic are more.	3.583228098740104

Because of being afflicted with disease repeatedly children with asthma generally get physically weak.	4.454091304855414

The physical and mental development of these children could also be hindered.	6.9481795784885225

Also , do not give solid food to babies for 4 months.	5.496058821311162

After this gradually start giving fruit , vegetables first and then grains.	5.201030248097183

In children brought up drinking mother 's milk chances of allergy are less as compared to cow milk drinking children.	4.758420350814647

Make the small children lie down on soft , cotton bed sheets and cover them.	5.078106615726707

If the child is asthmatic then do n't make him sleep on a dusty bed.	4.189434297897189

Hepatitis - B can be more dangerous than AIDS.	7.546063258673972

Hepatitis-B is a common disease happening worldwide whose virus infects the liver in a serious manner.	4.76044209679573

Virus of Hepatitis-B produce swelling in the liver because of which it can not function properly.	7.155133969049718

This disease is even more infectious than AIDS because it goes very easily into body of another person via blood.	4.101489259767893

Just one virus of Hepatitis B is enough to spread this disease.	6.049128687987129

Other than blood it also spreads by other fluids and liquid substances coming out of body.	4.639032086394945

Like defecation , mother 's milk , tears , drool and open wounds.	6.678131053367672

By eating medicine on time and by following the advice of doctor 95 % people get better in 6 months.	5.680115653439722

The causes behind spreading of Hepatitis-B are the following :.	7.554590065687112

If blood of infected person is transfused in the body of a healthy person or the shot which was given to an infected person is given to a normal person then this virus goes from the infected person to the healthy person.	4.793288112978788

The most important causes of Hepatitis B happen to be at the time of child birth from the womb of infected mothers.	5.576025787019701

During this , the blood which touches the body of the child , the virus situated in that infected blood goes inside the child as soon as coming in contact with the blood of the child.	4.410078614978973

Along with India in all the countries of Asia this type of infection spreads a lot and new born baby gets infected from infancy itself.	5.028592588608444

In the field of athletics when an infected individual gets wounded and if his blood somehow comes in contact with the blood of a healthy person then it spreads very easily.	4.199151452236166

It also spreads exceedingly among those who consume drugs via needle.	5.0442356766739715

If an applied syringe taken from an infected person is used by another person then virus goes in the healthy person.	3.744950624104448

When someone in man and woman is infected with Hepatitis B and they have unprotected sexual intercourse then by this also the virus goes in the healthy person.	3.9996110609249866

Even 1 part of blood of a person infected with Hepatitis B is capable of spreading Hepatitis B.	5.879681790821016

Hepatitis B is more dangerous than AIDS can be reckoned by this fact that the number of people that die because of Hepatitis B in 1 day is same as the number of people that die with the infection of AIDS in a year.	3.8387050917155685

In India healthy person is also infected with Hepatitis B.	5.89705717287368

In many individuals despite being Hepatitis B positive they do not have the knowledge that they have Hepatitis B because this virus is unable to affect that individual too much.	4.562402006587102

If Hepatitis B infects young people then 95 % get free of the disease in 6 months only.Only the remaining 5 % stay infected with the disease.	5.218238107707456

The main symptoms of Hepatitis B :.	6.323370013713285

Do not be careless in treatment of spine tumor.	5.742448666057619

In human body other body parts are attached to the spine in such a way that it can move body around according to its own convenience.	4.674110584898052

All daily jobs done by humans are effected by ` spinal cord ' situated in body.	4.36467515688003

On this Earth most developed is the very human mind which thinks for sure but it is given consequence by ` spinal cord ' only.	4.991490365262679

In body role of spinal cord safe in the backbone is like an electric wire , like on pressing a switch bulb turns on.	4.40382487094917

but electricity reaches the bulb through the wire only.	6.096148089536992

Just like this , in getting every job finished , role of spinal cord is foremost.	4.9220443747837175

Spine happens to be the base of the whole body and rest of the bones are joined to each other like the ends of a staff.	5.753797163054357

Back bone not being straight like a staff is made of 33 vertebrae and between every two vertebrae there is a disc.	5.001068435855212

At the posterior side of back bone there are many tiny joints.	6.399578394994882

It is these discs and joints that impart the ability to the back bone , that we can bend on all four sides.	4.1640036746737525

As bones of other parts of body get worn with age , just like that back bone also gets worn.	5.546201400295013

In many people due to the amount of water being less disc tears so there is waist pain.	5.579902156697497

This pain can go from the neck towards the hand or the waist towards the foot.	5.297267468412733

Now treatment of tumor in spine has been considered very hard but today due to a lot of techniques it has become easy.	5.8288917909431035

In spine tumor most common are those tumors in which cancer is in some other part of the body and tumor has occurred in the bone.	4.845453464600395

In this prostrate cancer is also included.	7.987572419909973

It is called metastasis.	10.433133600002082

In our country most of the spine tumor patients are of this category.	5.8710989025928155

The middle layer is called dermis and the innermost layer is called epidermis.	5.12395058094372

Dermis has flexibility and the protein and moisture in it helps in preventing wrinkles.	5.851069182651374

With advancement in age the flexibility and moisture in dermis starts reducing by which the layer becomes thin and is not able to send moisture to the outer layer.	5.004732620943568

The result of which are wrinkles.	11.338180320158067

Short term and long term solutions have been included in this national program.	5.127770086752699

The plan for long term solutions have been made for making Vitamin A rich food materials abundant and to encourage their food.	3.925400971880923

On the other hand in order to prevent blindness and to avoid the other ill effects of deficiency of Vitamin A the heavy dose of Vitamin A to children from 6 months to 5 years is a short term solution.	4.057230954006844

National nutrition Organisation , Hyderabad reviewed this national program in 1978.	6.091838070323856

In order to achieve the desired result from the program it has been found that it is important to make the related health workers and those running the program more aware together with the immense cooperation of people of the community.	3.762584689482034

The department of health and family welfare formed a task force in 1989 to prepare the principles to rectify the execution of the Vitamin A program and to clarify the ways of the work.	3.4191919280117884

Under this effort a booklet has been prepared for the health workers and those who are running the program.	5.308021949079543

In the developing countries the deficiency of Vitamin A has been identified as a chief problem occurring due to the deficiency of nutrition and control over it can be achieved.	5.16441435893536

The role of Vitamin A in the prevention of blindness due to lack of nutrition is very well known.	5.257591773750444

According to a vague estimation the eye sight of around 30 - 40 thousand children may be lost due to deficiency of Vitamin A.	3.7054386218237245

Vitamin A has a very huge hand in correcting the health of children and reducing their mortality rate.	5.362748753251964

Till now there is no clear knowledge as to how Vitamin A does such vital works.	4.74163063329083

It has been noticed in Indonesia that the children in whom there is deficiency of Vitamin A , in them the danger of onset of dysentery and the grave type of infection related to respiration increases by 2 to 3 times.	4.225787037411696

Death of around 50 percent children in India is due to dysentery and the diseases related to respiratory diseases.	5.933843122688149

Because of measles the quantity of accumulated Vitamin A in the body decreases.	7.398423183712371

Because of the heavy fall in quantity of Vitamin A the danger of chances of other diseases increase.	6.145256500155515

These diseases are pneumonia , onset of dysentery and dry eye discharge xerophthalmia.	4.739205515439501

Every year thousands of children die due to measles and other complications occurring because of it.	4.384987885217151

Apart from this the cornea of the eye is damaged due to this and the child may also become blind.	5.9990157797400645

The deficiency of Vitamin A - why and how ? 	7.3538787613537275

The deficiency of Vitamin A gives rise to xerophthalmia that is , the disease of dry eye discharge the drying up of eye.	5.651291900409022

In xerophthalmia the outermost layer of the pupil , that is , conjunctiva and after that the layer below the conjunctiva , cornea , dries up.	4.15901206341077

Due to the damage of cornea after this the eye sight is lost.	4.772368433277609

When the accumulated Vitamin A in body finishes and the quantity of Vitamin A received by body through daily food is less than required then xerophthalmia occurs.	4.46783971338747

Xerophthalmia occurs due to these reasons.	11.003907328559063

Xerophthalmia occurs due to the reduced consumption of less food rich in Vitamin A everyday.	5.489264967191555

Xerophthalmia occurs due to the error in transmission of the absorbed retinol to the right place in the body and the fast depletion of the accumulated Vitamin in the body.	4.6329499969100825

The deficiency of food materials rich in Vitamin , the reduction of the quantity of Vitamin A accumulated in the body are the chief causes of xerophthalmia.	4.762928338390404

The absorption of Vitamin A in the children victims of dysentery , respiration related infections , measles , diseases of stomach and intestines decreases and its need to the body increases.	4.409300033865466

As a result of this a cabal of infections starts.	4.558429181289718

Because of the deficiency of Vitamin a the power of the body to fight with the infections is reduced.	4.58768550224878

Due to infection the health of the child goes on deteriorating.	7.013677480179186

Eye related signals and symptoms -.	9.654984337367628

Although the deficiency of Vitamin A affects many organs but its worst effect is seen on the eyes because of which eye sight is constantly lost.	5.308950297699469

The surface of the cornea becomes dry and rough which later on ruptures partially or completely.	4.57153662596803

Wound develops because of this in the cornea.	11.37126384917198

The damage to eyes is such due to the wound in the cornea that it is permanent , that is , it can never become alright.	6.0265231586503365

The eye sight goes by this.	6.9047009124256045

Eye related symptoms are the most trustworthy measure to identify the deficiency of Vitamin A.	5.027222343799079

In the serious condition of disease the grave symptoms may become visible early.	5.878046848198429

It is not essential that mild symptoms before order and grave symptoms later on are visible.	3.4514816321489823

The detection of the signs and symptoms of xerophthalmia.	5.8637318920764905

Night blindness : the first symptom of xerophthalmia.	6.8138066675635

Bitata stains - although there could be difference in the shape , place and design of the bitata stains but they are similar in appearance.	4.695638435768697

Bitata stains are formed due to the accumulation of frothy substance on conjunctiva.	6.080284882762575

If disease of keratomalacia is not treated then cornea at the place of wound may get permanently damaged.	4.994641604484007

Due to keratomalacia a hole may occur in the cornea.	6.320168446138841

In the condition of hole in cornea the damage would never be corrected.	4.374424045098008

The sooner the treatment of keratomalacia is done the smaller would be the wound and the damage of cornea.	5.727909407122596

If the treatment is done fast then the damage of the cornea and the blindness occurring due to it can be completely prevented.	5.302610602469621

The mobile phones of hospital staff become home of diseases.	4.948363036082305

The mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern life style may become the reason for the spreading of disease.	4.332117338950496

This fact has come forward in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of MGM hospital situated in Washi here.	3.1372011328805027

More than 82 percent workers of hospitals are found to be the careers of microbes and organisms of contagious diseases in a study.	4.859540400864704

The doubt of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , pimples , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases are in this.	4.474506204639098

According to the study done by the Indian Medical Research Council the test of 120 mobile phones of the workers were done.	3.2309167813919597

The researcher final year student of MBBS of MGM medical college Dr.Nikhil Tambe has found that such organisms and microbes have been found on 99 phones , which along with making the disease of the patient serious may also become the reason of delay in his getting well.	3.5949699423757218

Tambe has said that the maximum number of presence of microbes has been found in phones of the technicians.	4.719320612260476

After this the mobile phones of ward , nurse and then doctor were infected.	3.4922554407468214

The chief of the microbiology department of the hospital Dr.Chitra said that the maximum 54.6 percent stacillococcus acurus organisms have been found on the mobiles , which become the reason of skin disease.	3.5397724832673614

Apart from this the organisms like e - coli and pseudomonas have also been found because of whose infection the ill effect on the body is maximum.	4.487254657305195

In one of the studies done in Coimbatore the presence of 96.2 percent organisms was found on the phone of the hospital workers.	4.324755296595316

Sprouted cauliflower may protect from the cancer of stomach.	6.4183933464176315

This fact has come up from one of the studies that by eating germinated cauliflower three days early keeps you miles away from stomach cancer , gastritis and ulcer.	3.6299577033720913

Sprouted cauliflower destroys the microbes which give rise to these diseases.	5.58252754513279

According to the published study in the General Prevention Research of the American Association for Cancer Research situated in America by eating 70 gram quantity of germinated cauliflower regularly three days before finishes the effect of the organism named helicobacter pylori H.pylori.	3.185928091869835

H.pylori microbe is the maximum reason of the diseases related to stomach and the cancer of stomach.	6.9281047522900945

Jade Fahe , the research associate of the faculty of the department of medicine science of the John Hopkins School of Medicine has said that it has been found from the study that with germinated cauliflower not only in animals but in man also it is capable of stopping cancer.	3.964275001788871

In the beginning of the study on these people the effect of these organisms was studied after four to eight weeks following it through various tests.	3.9116694807632775

After eight weeks it was found less , however the effect of the microbes on the ones feeding on Alfa was fond to be the same.	4.829793920390604

New oral vaccine has been prepared for diarrhoea.	7.21807258743281

The National Institute of Disease , NICD Kolkata did test on 70 thousand people.	3.9177717668812697

The cost of the dose of oral vaccine would be 40 - 50 rupees.	4.309547317538622

To prevent diarrhoea the chances of the oral vaccine to come early to the market has increased manifold.	4.268715699171579

The National Institute of Intric Disease has completed the successful test on around 70 thousand people.	3.6862293339619012

70 percent cases have come positive in the test.	6.555073560133709

Although around one year of time may be required for the oral vaccine to come in the market.	5.533975732621819

The cost of the dose of the medicine may be between 40 to 50 rupees.	5.034162423287103

Despite this there was no vaccine for the treatment of diarrhoea.	6.959907897006231

But after the untiring efforts of hundreds of researchers success has been achieved in the preparation of one more vaccine.	3.3615892405019614

International Vaccine Institute Korea has manufactured this medicine.	6.4674727502202956

To escape from the Indian market a national company has bought this formula.	4.30880386030318

The cost of this medicine would be one dollar per dose and any person would have to take two doses of it.	4.887220667786456

The effect of medicine will stay for two years.	6.575157894901629

In Vietnam the dose of vaccine has already been given to 90 lakh people and in Kolkata , India the trial has been done on 70 thousand people , in which the accuracy of the medicine has been found to be 70 percent.	4.920012988149385

In the program specialists from World Health Organisation , National Institute of Cholera and Intrinsic Disease Kolkata , ICMR , Department of Biotechnology of the Central Government and International Vaccine Institute Korea.	2.9201630870784347

The experts have told that the first to prevent diarrhoea is oral vaccine.	5.867469890817598

Its maximum benefit would be in Orissa , West Bengal along with the people living in other coastal regions of the country and on international level Africa , Australia and people residing in the coastal areas in other countries , because the number of cases registered here is maximum.	3.7375899959226397

Though this medicine can not be administered to children who are less than one year of age.	4.944898976830424

According to the figures of World Health Organisation the total number of case registered for cholera was one lac 77 thousand in the whole world and 4 thousand 31 people died because of this.	3.3681837789410656

Because of unavailability of any vaccine to prevent this disease one has to depend only on the methods of precautions.	5.298972820194605

According to the World Health Organisation the effect of diarrhoea is seen more in coastal areas like Orissa , West Bengal , Gujarat and metropolitans like Delhi and Mumbai.	3.4360526474121733

How can the diagnosis and treatment of cancer be done ? 	7.001053281343441

Many times due to less information or carelessness the diagnosis of breast cancer is done late.	4.754329452498583

If you stay a little attentive then the treatment of breast cancer is possible timely.	6.149815995264305

Be cautious towards your body and get investigated by the doctor from time to time then riddance from breast cancer can be obtained easily.	4.557250575905478

If tumor is felt in breasts together with growth in the arm pits then be cautious.	5.2125637689202655

Mild pain and swelling is felt on that place because of the growth of tumor.	9.664304586513532

Change comes in the breasts or their size.	11.091782989915776

At times wound appears on the place of swelling and then blood secretion starts from there.	6.024387548402409

When the tumor is on the upper and outer surface of the breast and there is secretion from the breast then immediately contact the doctor in such situation.	5.601025564704137

The tumor appears hard and there is no pain in it on touching.	5.742112903116675

The women who are more than thirty years of age should certainly themselves inspect their breasts once monthly seven days after the menstruation.	3.5962562621934273

The stages of breast cancer are believed to be four.	7.2966662536817575

But as the spreading of the wound increases its treatment becomes difficult.	5.573991053627672

In the fourth stage also if its treatment is done then success is achieved in 50 percent cases.	4.588131600136556

In the first and second stage the treatment is cent percent possible.	4.47903892448135

In the first stage the size of the tumor is less than two centimetres.	6.116076842739221

The tumor of two centimetres is not visible in any part of theory.	5.926897994932878

In the second stage the tumor grows to two to five centimetres big.	4.182404632141707

This reaches to the neighbouring gland of colourless fluid.	6.555968611426418

In the third stage the tumor grows to five cm and spreads to the skin and muscles of the body but does not reach up to the neighbouring gland.	4.878922022114358

In the fourth and very dangerous stage the tumor can be of any size.	4.74166158636146

The tumors do get affected by this and it also spreads to the other parts of the body.	5.829170112939091

As first surgery is done on the area with pain and then it is diagnosed that how big is the spread.	6.564149903320419

The conclusion may be wrong at the clinical stage but at the surgical stage the condition becomes very clear.	4.24798086500724

After the age of forty years the women should certainly get the mammography done.	4.560927299021453

In one mammography the expenditure comes to one thousand rupees.	5.209385282720791

Do not hesitate at all in getting mammography done.	5.698482205158229

Discuss about this , tell this to the members of the family and accumulate new information.	5.956682184169665

The treatment of breast cancer is expensive , which comes to one lac rupees.	5.341689700055578

But many charitable institutes are such which help immensely in this to the person.	4.916831764033066

Many help line services are also available for the treatment of breast cancer.	5.973059774325748

the treatment of cancer depends upon the age of the patient , the shape and spreading of the tumor formed in the breast.	7.428612366291174

Maximum women have to undergo surgery following which they are advised for anti cancer drug or hormone therapy.	4.292871305002372

After the age of forty get mammogram done regularly or else do the inspection of your breast yourself after consulting the doctor.	3.3126331364846933

If there is any type of tumor in the breast then immediately contact the doctor.	3.72284827752272

All the tumors are not cancerous but showing precaution is important.	4.914979561788682

If there is discharge of blood from the breast then immediately show to the doctor.	4.509340838656628

In the grown situation of the cancer the breast has to be removed partially or completely.	5.607746471658438

At present in place of the severed breast fake breast can be implanted through surgery.	4.41020730535703

The creation of breast is done with the tissues of the muscles of the patients only.	6.934434179507906

Since breast cancer is also dependent on the quantity of hormone in the blood , therefore the chances of cancer decreases on removing the uterus.	6.107172811486255

Whoever has got breast cancer once should not conceive in future , because by this there is a chance of breast cancer to start again.	5.287373042151964

In order to be safe from breast cancer it is important to bring change in ones food habits and physical and mental behavior as well.	4.350972710276222

Get your breasts checked up once in a month.	5.507265682834673

The benefit of this is that if you are suspicious then in the first stage only you will get to know about that and you will be saved from the danger forever.	5.825683665089517

Start the test seven days after the menstruation.	5.959075632586089

Toothache should not take away sleep.	13.375380160164012

The health of your entire body and beauty is connected with the health of teeth.	5.855098631570919

The aching of teeth is actually such pain which if happens to anybody then his sleep at night and the peace of daytime is lost.	4.498511331975597

If you want to escape from toothache then do not show even a slight carelessness in the care of teeth.	4.734772291459405

Although everyone know this that teeth are the very important part of the human body but still it has been seen that there are less than 20 % of the people who get the regular checkups of their teeth done.	5.507319173984047

65 percent of the children in our country don not get any type of dental care.	6.963308368440415

The effort should be this that cleaning teeth should be included in the habit of the child and later on it should not have any difficulty.	6.4437252677242896

When the teeth of the children start coming out then it is required to keep special eye on them and to keep more information about teeth.	5.030145055368543

Often it has been seen that in this phase the children suck their thumb a bit more.	4.8844030843267685

Actually they get relief by sucking their thumb.	9.10991087994637

If this habit of sucking thumb does not get over even by the age of four-five years then the case becomes serious.	5.080902393022217

The thumb starts weakening and it also has bad effect on the teeth as well.	6.1450879455758285

In such case many times to give correct shape to the teeth many times the braces are needed.	4.639343177313723

It should not be such that in order to stop the thumb you give nipple to the child that also the honey one.	7.060510817467895

This will be even worse with him.	6.950049790655196

Implantologist and orthodontist play the chief role in this.	6.190552577753932

Implant is the latest technology in India.	9.10636173667036

Generally before implanting tooth the nearby good teeth are rubbed and then new tooth is fixed.	4.3719175596014095

Some myths which disturb.	12.480944137353648

The eyesight becomes weak on the removal of the upper tooth , this myth is totally false.	4.713428830840923

Removal of tooth has got nothing to do with sight.	6.040179517899483

When the artificial set of teeth or denture is built for once then it comes to use for the entire lifetime.	4.3352213169748675

But it is not at all like that , the tissues below the denture keep engine with time and the dentures do not fit and such dentures then do not stay hygienic , therefore the dentist advice to change it every five years.	3.4198779691184984

If the scaling of the teeth is not done regularly then the gums become weak and the teeth start falling after getting rotten.	5.357765812650165

The procedure for the treatment of teeth is painful , it is not at all like that.	5.520234108293576

The patient is given local anaesthesia due to which no matter what kind of treatment is done to the teeth there is no feeling of pain.	6.248910367695039

Very modern high drilling machines also do not vibrate much.	5.98614195229496

The pregnant women should not get the treatment of the teeth done , this myth is also baseless.	6.251154904280424

If the x-ray is not done in the initial three months of pregnancy then it would be good.	6.568023282319263

The teeth should be massaged with finger and not brush , this is also a false belief.	5.962516892394185

A brush having good bristles removes the food particles entangled in the teeth properly.	4.921475121730147

Massaging the gums with finger after cleaning the teeth with brush is beneficial.	5.691057546371665

It is not good to clean teeth with rice , salt and tobacco powder etc.	5.014869856179752

While the truth is that in good quality pastes there are such particles which are specially mixed for the teeth.	4.255081770385876

The loather formed out of paste destroys the bacteria on the teeth while because of these things the upper layer of the teeth becomes bad and the dirt on the teeth is also not removed.	5.0481829706994565

The arrangement of blood is a very important work.	9.52726582187746

During pregnancy there is often the deficiency of blood in women.	7.576497074074829

If any danger arises during delivery then excess blood may flow out of the body of mother.	5.781107193316254

In such situation it may be required to give her more blood.	5.3297477749980615

In such time it is the moral responsibility of all the males of the household and the neighborhood to give blood.	5.41833214170638

At least two blood donators definitely go to the hospital so that on requirement blood may be received by the pregnant woman.	4.438922542562347

Even eat vegetables and lentils of green leaves every alternate day.	6.234408950729797

Pregnant women should not drink tea before and after meals.	6.066186595575792

Due to the consumption of tea the use of iron elements found in food does not take place completely.	5.714647405741529

Lemon , orange , guava , raspberry and raw mango with meals increases the use of this iron element in the body.	4.652385120003238

Eating tablets given by A.N.M.sister  Anganwadi activist is also very necessary for not letting the blood lack in body.	4.518253418538217

If the child falls sick then should consumption be stopped ? 	4.572358849452763

If the child odes not eat then would he not become weak ? 	4.4576317904786364

Therefore on child falling sick also do not stop feeding food to him.	5.085090790356733

In such condition you will have to give more attention to the child.	6.400199383454048

It may be that you will have to feed the child with your hand little by little.	6.296265005163564

If the child drinks milk then make him drink milk regularly.	4.919781670131288

Now your child is growing up and his body has started growing.	6.764192889127425

The child needs more meals , more food.	6.81468637456645

Now for child your milk only is not enough.	7.287377283069927

Now the child needs food two - three times in a day.	3.8459077864632105

That too such , which the child may eat with interest.	8.756012639106485

Now the teeth of the child have not come out.	8.636673818019368

In such a situation what will you make him eat ? 	5.191375520107939

Give the child mashed things in food like mashed roti , dalia , mashed fruits and vegetables.	3.9604573002040753

On the attainment of one year age of the child increase his dose.	8.56164886229344

Now instead of feeding the child two - three times a day feed him at least half bowl of food five - six times a day.	4.209172035615147

You should not feed the child till the time he does not start eating his entire food after asking it from you on his own.	3.632977157246133

Contraceptives have given new description to women and new dimension as well.	5.056496741977748

Especially because of the contraceptive pills they got the right to take the decision on their own to give birth to the child.	5.936087790619268

Apart from healthy and active life to women the contraceptives have also given this self confidence that they themselves have the right on their body.	4.294702029066922

Contraceptives have helped in making life of women simple.	6.352023704947171

Now they are capable of living their life according to their own wish.	5.916455935241617

When they want children , how many children , whether they want or not , they can decide this with the help of their life partner.	4.565414093425207

Birth of child is now not her compulsion , it is her own decision.	5.603789381139964

She has also proved to be a good mother by this.	5.623778139868255

A healthy woman , consisting of self confidence only can give a better future to the society.	3.959770142007747

The woman plays an important role in the betterment of own child and the entire family through less children and proper gap in the age of children and in this contraceptives help her in every step.	4.233674595979046

The history of contraceptives is also told to be very old , despite this they got a developed form in this century only.	4.254759026052598

More important than this is that first time the identity of women got approval in the form of a human being.	5.227521693418547

What is conception ? 	17.127737379445904

When the sperms of man meet with the ovum of woman then conception takes place.	4.242148535212096

But before this conception many situations are formed.	7.652088864738694

Firstly the sperms reach the uterus by going through the vaginal canal and enter the fallopian tube.	4.374991444774679

Here in the broad portion of the tube there is mating with the developed eggs which comes out of the ovary.	4.839069035184796

On entering the eggs sperms mix their chromosomes with the egg.	5.416140178739698

The egg gets fertilized and after developing gets converted into a multicelled ball which is called blastocyst.	4.4786717911736575

This gets attached to the surface of the uterus.	6.0155066736069935

The contact with the muscles of the tube and the cilia lining as thin as hair advance the egg towards uterus.	4.481087333005117

The egg does not advance on its own.	5.0941922640787265

Every month many eggs are developed but in hair follicle only one egg is able to develop.	4.7157234397883165

The other eggs get squeezed on their own.	5.337746053186443

Lakhs of sperms enter the uterus but maximum get destroyed due to the reason of the acidic substances inside.	4.518477826105054

One or two out of whatever sperms escape get attached to the outer layer of the egg and the moment conception takes place , it puts a ban on the entry of other sperms.	3.9787707815520728

Following situations come in conception.	10.44307336076488

Sperms passes through the uterus and goes to the fallopian tube.	7.267394574403041

The egg enters the tube.	9.338681590434968

The sperm makes the egg conceive.	9.01101274311025

The zygote gets divided into two.	9.267127805157143

64 cells of zygote enter inside the uterus.	7.695785911204085

This gets converted into a seed.	7.905558577292375

On reaching its destination the seed gets connected with the surface of the uterus.	4.544493389052786

Here it gets nutritive substances from the blood cells of the mother.	6.632558935871355

Related to the menstrual cycle generally women have this misbelief that it is dirty blood and the more it flows out of the body the better it is.	5.300182976621393

But this is a very wrong misbelief.	11.888057065597682

Actually the reason of menstruation is the destruction of inner wall of skin inside the uterus , that is , the endometruim line.	5.671101028061684

The thinner this wall would be , that much less would be the flow of blood.	5.447847571124729

Because of excess flow there is a deficiency of iron elements in the body of the woman and the woman becomes victim of anemia.	5.166510815846434

Actually menstrual cycle is one such physical change in the body of women which comes entirely within the system of reproduction and is very important for reproduction.	6.144212692174489

The menstruation coming every month is the time between the onset of puberty and menarche.	5.082951223368939

During the menstrual cycle from the body of fully mature woman during ovulation ovum is released , with this the lining of uterus , endometrium develops that time only.	4.430076770489518

After ovulation this lining prepares the reproduced egg and conception takes place.	4.2912052051502965

If conception does not take place then a new menstrual cycle starts.	6.599581824909674

Generally the menstrual cycle is of 28 days.	5.436603372174025

It has three phases - in first phase menstruation from 1 up to 5 days.	4.022845083892002

In the second phase the hormone cycle from 6 up to 13 days.	3.9203492044701598

The third phase suitable for reproduction 14 to 28.	6.839536490538907

Before the start of menstruation many changes in the hormones take place , whose maximum effect is seen on the behavior of the women , like the increase of irritation , some stiffness in breast , increase of weight , swelling etc.	4.42274114491881

Because of the reason of the bursting of ovarian cyst many times there is sudden pain in abdomen.	4.440622520438874

Many times blood also starts flowing heavily , the reason of occurrence of both these complications together is soreness in genitals.	5.481215659075678

But there is no need to panic in this because these diseases become alright easily by proper treatment.	3.844050069852474

Generally there is a misbelief that four days prior to menstruation , four days of menstruation and four days after menstruation are very safe , but this is possible only when your menstruation is regular.	4.507032806888189

The second method is that everyday the woman takes her temperature and notes that in a diary.	4.731717341625587

The day on which temperature rises by one degree then believe that egg has been produced this day.	3.9489990640148473

Five days before and after this day are said to be unsafe.	6.8871446192119326

By recording the temperature for three - four months the woman can easily get to know her unsafe days easily.	5.2903403935570195

Various methods are present for contraception , you have to choose according to your ease.	6.238169031940733

Because of not using the methods of contraception children are born one after the other and by becoming victim of malnutrition go to the embraces of death.	4.609479241540482

In the entire world death of around 60 thousand children takes place , out of this 99 percent deaths occur only in developing countries.	3.6897745618971274

The mother and child should stay healthy and fit and proper gap should be there between two children , for all these it is important that methods of contraception should be used.	4.858519538832095

For men condom is very cheap and is a simple option and it also saves them from many infections.	5.199564479882321

There should be knowledge of the method of its proper use.	7.13333492864726

Apart from this because of this the woman has to depend completely on the man.	5.25313130041588

After discharging instead of putting the semen in the woman ' s vagina he throws it outside.	4.687773060253353

Though it is a good and free of cost option , but because of this the danger of conception is maintained without interruption.	6.481322634941933

In the process of vasectomy also that passage is closed without incision through which the sperms flow.	4.645399609168463

What is to be understood is that only the passage is closed.	6.751687414544274

This is a small work of 15 minutes.	6.8509868022452345

By coming on his own the person can go back home on his own.	5.862363435101943

After vasectomy he can do his daily work as usual.	5.35571573015211

In vasectomy one precaution has to be taken , for the next three months while doing intercourse condom has to be used.	4.718582174527687

After vasectomy on the interval of one month and then in the third month coming for the doctoral test is important and after the doctoral report intercourse can be done without any tension without any condom.	3.8804359179615666

But for this men do not agree easily.	7.14707428326975

The options for contraception for women -.	8.644678744661034

Women can use pills , cream , jelly , sponge etc.which are put in the genitals so that semen can not go inside.	4.553715168562438

The pills are put some minutes before intercourse or on need may be put one hour before.	5.1176842223818575

During six hours if intercourse is done again then it is important to put the tablet again in the genital.	5.372713900432664

Copper T is a good option , these are of several types.	6.960915295256028

Copper T 380 A - this may be put for ten years.	5.798951573448299

Multiload copper T 250 and 375 - this may be put for five years.	6.481248952794754

By this technique semen may be stopped from coming inside.	6.098969555523972

But get the copper T fixed only when there is no pregnancy.	6.042371910085238

After getting the copper T fixed there is no need to use any other contraceptive option at all.	3.7605223460119275

After getting the copper T fixed get the doctoral check up done certainly in the interval of one month and then three months and then every six months.	3.2949519989738003

In market some emergency contraceptive pills are available.	6.544064404384414

These are such pills which are taken in emergency that is then when conception takes place by mistake.	4.822466553551618

These should be taken between 72 hours of conception.	10.3660178692638

After this take five days morning - evening.	6.100861834566867

Taking two pills immediately during conception morning - evening and two pills 12 hours after pregnancy the risk of pregnancy is averted.	4.912647124095664

This is done in two ways - first through telescope and second by cutting the stomach slightly.	4.806836755981887

By telescope the fallopian tube is either tied or destroyed.	5.945816632063763

Both these processes are painless and hundred percent successful contraceptives.	5.2213692963801375

At our place since long intercourse is done by calculating the days which is considered a successful contraceptive option to a great extent.	4.236352407486536

Apart from this regular and uninterrupted breast feeding is also considered to be a good contraceptive.	5.020998102031314

In today ' s modern world though there are options one after the other like condom , pills which are kept in the genitals , copper T , etc , but the most effective options are contraceptive pills.	3.9258170701378945

Contraceptive pills are those pills which are eaten which women find the most comforting.	4.838178243092456

In modern times Karl Deresy is considered to be the genitor of contraceptive pills.	4.401536849237769

These pills on going to the body of the female stop the female from conceiving.	6.127641547675727

Because of pills no new eggs are formed in the body of the female.	5.649702862577293

In the contraceptive pills of yesteryears the quantity of estrogen and progesterone used to be very high which had several ill effects.	5.169143987983355

But in modern pills there is no such danger.	7.522986050434738

These pills provide cent percent protection to the woman.	5.45234555946995

By this the menstrual cycle becomes regular.	6.740921314482238

The pain and blood flow occurring these days also reduces by which the complaint of anemia does not occur.	5.79135026545195

Apart from this , protection from the tumor of the breast etc.also takes place.	5.19816123654907

In 1970 some sort of reduction in the level of hormone had been brought.	5.252520418767938

After this its as if the standard of contraceptive pills have started improving.	5.434865372212837

Today these pills have only been considered to be the best contraceptives.	6.346247863996116

For 21 days one pill only had to be taken daily according to fixed time.	5.566984534744405

Now the pill to be taken once a week has also come.	7.192811075961032

These contraceptive pills are easily available in the market which may be bought from any chemist.	4.717335033963566

These pills may be bought from any medical store.	5.3258613988860155

Related information is attached with these contraceptive pills.	7.2993237788010354

Obesity does not only make the personality unattractive , it even attracts many diseases.	4.6865942632340225

How should be the lifestyle for staying fit ? 	6.399456473008232

No one wants that there should be useless fat on his body but due to carelessness in lifestyle weight starts increasing and many types of diseases start surrounding.	4.705652564630216

Today piling up of fat on body is a universal problem.	6.37640146490521

It should in fact be said that in case of obesity India is slowly on path of America.	5.151143404351351

Here obesity is given the status of disease.	9.08363820233997

Here every third person is victim of obesity.	6.34704108046091

If said in the language of the doctors , then any person becomes obese when in comparison to the calorie used by him he consumes calorie in more quantity through the medium of food and other food materials.	4.609562040587495

This imbalance in the consumed and used calorie may arise due to various reasons.	5.04110940137672

Now this depends on the particular person that which reason is responsible for him becoming fat.	5.650855690355195

Obesity may also happen due to hereditary reasons.	8.474271285157313

Although this is also a fact that the food habits and life style of some families are the ones which increase obesity.	6.040813305784691

But despite this , it has been proved in researches that somewhere the biological makeup of human body is also responsible for obesity.	4.708627511417498

Especially for adopted children it has already been proved that there is much closeness in their weight and the weight of their real parents in comparison to the weight of their adopted parents.	5.3692393251584045

Environmental reasons also become a cause for obesity.	8.791127023412894

What any person eats and how much he is involved in physical activity , it has a direct relation with his health , especially the weight of the body.	4.302521671100644

If he does not burn the calorie received through food , then extra calorie starts accumulating in his body in the form of fat.	4.631791905596659

And lastly the result is the person becoming victim of obesity.	5.710095139687871

Today people eat a lot of fast food and fried things but save their skin from labor.	5.881429055783969

At homes modern instruments are present for the help of women , then children keep sitting in front of TV , computer for hours.	4.793324947702804

Not only this their mouth is always full with chips , chocolates and other market things.	4.226800159932742

On the other hand seven - eight hours of a day of office going women - men are spent sitting on the chair.	4.04131992479043

What is meant by saying is that the opportunities for man to be included in physical activities are becoming less and less and the consequences are in front.	4.666244758561829

Even the smell of food makes the person obese.	7.156760045325706

Many times even when there is no hunger he comes towards the food attracted with the smell and in return he gets more calorie than the required.	4.330619111740329

Psychological reasons also become the cause of obesity.	8.373677684194588

On being mentally unhealthy also there is tendency of man to eat more.	5.510110581414842

Especially , on being victim of tension , sadness , anger or inferiority complex not only do the people eat more , but at regular intervals they also get the urge to eat something or the other.	3.667139110471756

This way they not only receive calorie in high quantity but by repeated eating the eaten food also does not get digested and the rate of their digestion the rate of the consumption of energy becomes disrupted.	4.498208298983216

In such situation it becomes a difficult task for them to get rid of obesity.	5.435173518912633

But it is seen up to the extent that the enthusiasm towards life in the person disturbed mentally diminishes.	5.138973524809235

And in such situation he becomes depressed towards keeping himself fit or to reduce obesity.	5.128219697126572

The diseases occurring due to obesity.	10.002822512876142

Heart attack , sugar type B , stone in gall bladder , high blood pressure etc.	5.194709995401549

many types of cancer like cancer of intestine and prostrate in men , then the cancer of reproductive organs , uterus , ovary , breast and gall bladder etc.	5.460890105644397

The disease of joints , the disease of liver , sleep apnia that is obstruction in breathing for some moments during sleep.	5.014650630803391

In women the irregularity of menstruation and infertility etc happen.	5.399881318773201

Some special types of diseases also make the body of the person fatty.	9.101301845358057

Hypothyroidism , depression , consumption of steroids or anti - depressant medicines are some such situations , when fat starts building up on the body of the person.	4.494900613430287

In women they have seen to become fat especially on the occurrence of the complication of thyroid or after the surgery of uterus.	5.153512772617835

Similarly after delivery also they become fat in an abnormal way.	6.108372944950256

Although their weight starts increasing during pregnancy , but this is the stage of overweight , not that the quantity of fat starts increasing on the body.	5.4507289111496435

While after giving birth to the child fat only increases on their body , gaining control over which is many times beyond their limits.	4.407471967818761

Often the meaning of obesity for people is the increase of weight , but this is not the right definition of obesity.	5.557836904540565

According to medical experts , in the increased weight the weight of everything like muscles , bones , fat and water are included.	4.2204612141362094

While with obesity the meaning is - accumulation of fat in body in proportion higher than a certain quantity.	5.18445961890789

That is the direct relation of obesity is with fat , not with the increased weight of the body.	3.9865670638755915

Like if we consider body builders and athletes then their weight is very high.	4.723211805696509

Despite this body builders and athletes are not fat.	4.967955818901251

Body builders and athletes are stay absolutely fit and healthy.	4.947019684471955

But this does not mean at all that fat is bad every ways.	3.9479182277830436

It is important that in every human being there should be fat in certain quantity for storage of energy in the body , for the maintenance of enough heat , to bear the shocks from outside or to other such important works.	4.249088393319336

You are fat or whether you are fat or not , to know this it is important to know BMI or body mass index.	4.730606569160977

The easy way to know BMI is - BMI = weight  height square meter.	4.550558072750588

If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9 , then it is considered that the weight of the person is more , while people with BMI of 30 or more than 30 are called obese.	4.803398292106835

Though BMI is incapable of saying this that in a person the quantity of fat is more or that of muscles , bones , fat , and water etc.	4.805082678230465

Then also with its help the quantity of fat can be estimated to a very great extent.	4.343450422258741

To know this together with the weight of the person his height in square meter is also needed and in height all the organs of the person are included to a very great extent.	3.895307289501825

There is no alternative to exercise in reducing obesity , But if you feel that strolling morning - evening is exercise then it is completely wrong.	4.732729671829797

With exercise the meaning is - to bring the heart rate to the level of 75 percent to its rate after doing exercise for 20 to 60 minutes.	5.2566243913406785

Like if your age is 40 years , then your desired heartbeat rate is 220 - 40 = 180.	5.755325783148784

Your level of exercise is its 75 percent , that is it should be 135 par minute.	6.904725326974878

For this anything in cycling , jogging , aerobics may be included in the daily routine.	4.669587763093643

Together with this do yogay , also meditation , but while doing exercise you must keep certain thing in mind.	4.008015267195574

For heart patients walking fast , jogging or brisk walking are the best exercise , but if their has been a heart attack recently or there has been a bypass surgery , then definitely take the advice of the doctor before exercising.	4.130075940496887

With this keep in mind the following things in the daily routine -.	5.3596518626428065

take deep breaths while exercising , but pay attention not to stop breathing.	5.579100291308288

keep at least an interval of one hour between meal and exercise.	6.768551709054

Do not exercise when you are sad , in tension or angry.	6.034035181367248

Adopt controlled lifestyle.	21.51350905943593

Smoking , drinking , mental tension fuel the fire , therefore escape from them.	5.050084885334399

If you are suffering from some psychological disorder or the disorder of overeating , then contact the psychologist or psychiatrist in time.	3.918993565600202

Because of more than required weight , children are becoming victims of the diseases which occur in adults.	6.254395290597911

Increasing obesity in children ahs come up in the form a serious problem.	8.526480417865567

It has become very important to control obesity.	7.7481303408554325

doctors believe that the treatment of obesity should be done in childhood only.	10.212570516284746

Because due to obesity on growing up diseases like heart problem , diabetes and high blood pressure start cropping up.	5.088003633491193

In maximum children the complaint of obesity is seen in the age of 2 - 5 years.	5.973300540480993

During this time the weight of children is more than their age , the chance of whose reduction diminish with increasing age.	5.188498810545854

In countries like India increasing urbanisation and globalisation have pit a deep impact on the food habits of children.	4.043139987387171

Today children relish the fun of TV , video game , DVD and other electronic gadgets for hours , because of which their sports have reduced.	3.951498021010979

Also with this the consumption of junk food has also increased in children , the cholesterol , and sugar which are found in them only become the main reason in increasing the quantity of calorie in the body.	5.393794239892017

Because of the reason of these junk food only around 10 to 20 percent children in India become the victims of obesity.	4.162233426695632

By 2030 approximately half of the children of the country will come in the clutches of this disease.	8.341195428837073

In a survey done recently this thing has come up that in the last 50 years the consumption of oily substances in Indian children has increased 20 percent.	4.91317232688316

In children eating candy , chocolate , pizza , hotdog , French fries and sweets the number of children in the age from 11 to 20 years is told to be around 80 percent , there the number of children from 9 - 11 years is told to be approximately 25 percent.	4.444026746574649

Apart from this at home mother - father should pay special attention on the food habits of children , by which they eat fibrous fruits and vegetables in more quantity leaving the fatty food.	3.762829371073255

The government of every country should put a prohibition on the advertisements of junk food that are shown on the TV.	3.954236253500304

Especially that time when children are watching programs on the TV.	6.117324718548797

In every school the period of yoga , exercise and PT should certainly be organised because of which their outdoor activity increases.	4.624404664838464

Also with this it is important to highlight their performance in the report card of the children , by which they themselves also stay alert.	4.160066130726894

the moment the eye of any person falls on the increased fat of his body , then immediately his attention goes towards his food and he starts dieting.	4.975107139285638

While for reducing the quantity of fat the requirement is of balanced diet.	6.03383920086312

Therefore , firstly get your check up done , so that it is assured that the weight is not increasing because of any disease.	6.018264736835233

Get a diet chart made from the dietician according to your height , weight , age , sex and routine that how much calorie you should consume through your food daily.	3.794945607444088

For your convenience some suggestions to control calorie are like this.	4.951995073777655

keep an account of you food and physical activities.	6.893766158791333

Mind it that in return to the eaten things you have done labor.	5.4185535322269915

If you like eating ice then eat it after taking out the rice water.	5.118430579078516

Drink at least two litres of water everyday.	8.133817316767386

Do not eat mango , banana , sapota and grapes.	5.310833049269706

Always eat thin dal and eat dal with peels moong dal , horse gram dal.	4.324856984725344

For chapatti instead of using flour of mill use thick flour made in millstone with the bran.	4.229145059590217

This mixture of cereals does not let fat increase on the body.	5.355284889308779

For cooking bring in use such oil , in which there is less cholesterol like soya bean or oil of corn.	5.051539930070555

If there is desire to eat sweets then eat such sweets , in which there has been no use ghee like petha in place of gulab jamun.	4.554476689574501

Consume less and less of fast food , meat , ghee , oil maida , sugar and dry fruits.	4.916427087332063

Consume less salt.	18.011354350217744

The direct relation of obesity is with our food habits , but the important thing is ` right eating ' not ` less eating '.	4.356192163145278

The use of bypass surgery in the treatment of heart diseases is not very old.	5.2541613442742605

This has proved to be a boon for the heart patients.	4.924562901817404

The obstruction created in the originating part of all the major arteries can be treated with bypass surgery.	5.085907782493036

Through the coronary angioplasty method a tube is made to reach the arteries of the heart through the medium of the starting point.	4.528835053800699

A balloon is fixed on this tube.	8.537125698551911

While putting the tube inside the balloon is deflated.	6.215359562602898

Studying the path of this tube on television it is taken to the place of obstruction.	6.070437061490499

Right at the pace of obstruction the balloon is inflated.	5.543857401160688

By this the obstruction in the arteries of the heart open up.	5.7193540252418655

Then the tube is taken out.	7.151757523010288

There are many benefits of this method like less expenditure , no need of surgery , there is no danger of infection as well and even one does not have to stay in the hospital for more days.	4.365921730850576

But this technique can not be brought into use for all the patients.	6.440135219097121

In opening up blocked arteries E.C.P.proves fruitful.	6.026291174243257

E.C.P.external counter pulsation is one such technique through the medium of which the blocks occurring in the arteries can easily be removed.	5.900260728504333

The moment the obstruction of the arteries are removed the transmission of blood in the body increases.	5.712775510052712

In the medical process of E.C.P.a set of three soft strips compressive cuffs is tied on the knees , lower thighs , upper thighs and hips of the patient.	3.5501625596436157

This soft strip keeps inflating and deflating regularly.	5.837480802323263

During this entire process these strips by putting pressure on thighs and hips increase the diastolic coronary perfusion pressure because of which reduction comes in the pressure exerted on the heart.	4.0198752023799775

E.C.P.Treatment process is very simple and easy.	6.0517739968941795

This treatment is given to the patient only for an hour.	6.363577964172292

In total this process continues for 35 hours in 7 weeks.	6.239995516908603

The patient is neither made unconscious during this nor any kind of medicine is given to him.	5.022885470874145

During the entire process of E.C.P.The patient feels very easy.	5.0863976270373925

In the immediate diagnosis of heart attack apart from E.C.P.And some special tests of blood at present a special type of camera is brought into use.	4.167232788760118

By this camera how much part of the heart has been damaged , this can be known.	6.859486258378883

The destroyed muscles of the heart may be diagnosed with the help of gamma camera.	5.9900359076782195

According to the heart specialists , immediately after heart attack more damage occurs in the heart by the accumulation of blood clots in the coronary arteries.	4.987345745759896

The clot of blood if accumulates on the upper part of the artery then the heart attack becomes serious.	5.184904769575958

Because in the upper part of the arteries only the flow of blood is more.	6.6505929618903386

On the accumulation of blood clot in the lower part or the last part of the artery the heart attack does not become serious.	5.738465888229226

Due to the reasons of the newest technique of medical science removal of blood clots now has become very easy.	4.1722655383544085

In the decade of eighties two injections were developed by the American medical scientists to remove these clots which are called ` streptochynas ' and ` urochynas '.	3.677225278534238

For the patients of heart these injections have proved to be a boon.	5.2903733327373175

In the cardiac medical science this technique is known by the name of ` thrombocytic therapy '.	4.6094694009141275

But today for the diagnosis of the diseases of the heart newer techniques better than the other are available.	5.781898473708522

The myth that after heart attack life becomes worthless , useless and meaningless has changed now very fast.	4.046762433466005

After becoming alright the patient may join their work.	5.947851437190736

The malfunctioning in the muscles of the heart may also be made alright like other diseases.	6.365717843474074

Rehabilitation is very important for the patients of the heart.	11.021818381556937

The meaning of rehabilitation is to make the patient capable of working again , removal of mental tension and making him able to lead normal life.	3.8796786015488487

Often after heart attack mental tension and fear start bothering the patient.	4.891067356164485

For leading a normal life it is important to remove such apprehensions.	6.500128465356654

There are three important stages of rehabilitation.	6.173045295052042

In the first stage it is important to remove the fear of becoming incapable or death from the mind of the patient.	5.1148170759484355

Also with this any kind of pressure exerted on the heart is tried to remove.	5.997032106923064

This is that stage when the patient is made healthy mentally.	6.619571987311894

The initiation of making the patient disease free completely takes place in the second stage.	5.958896005556998

In this the person comes out of the bed and also starts climbing up some stairs gradually and at the end he comes back.	5.053947165858123

The complete effort of the doctor is this that once again the patient becomes a healthy and active citizen of the society.	6.022588167575552

In the third stage it is tried to make the patient physically and mentally completely healthy.	4.637422093962791

In the SAAOL natural medication keep the heart disease free -.	6.370239664960382

Today the number of heart patients is increasing at a fast pace.	5.603715658862415

Medical science has also gone very far in this direction.	5.722641537503616

With techniques like angioplasty , bypass surgery the successful treatment of heart disease is possible.	5.786622360888655

But various research studies on the heart patients reveal that by taking slight precaution in one 's life pattern , style of living and food habits and by doing yoga and exercise the danger of many types of diseases may be averted.	4.722961237603247

the alternative of natural medication is beneficial.	8.296332705764218

the number of heart patients are increasing everyday.	8.087927972828709

People have to undergo expensive and risky surgeries.	6.283147884300504

At times one does not get much time between heart attack and heart fail that the patient may be saved depending on the doctor.	5.1927900392739845

But bring such changes in the lifestyle that these types of complications do not come then it would be even better.	5.57351028711271

According to the verdict of Dr.Vimal Chhajed the director and the heart specialist of SAAOL heart center of Delhi the alternative of natural treatment is the most beneficial for the patients of heart.	3.861934043178272

After getting the important tests for coronary heart disease the advice for surgery is given to the patient.	4.495935265358248

Even after getting the surgery done the patients has to come to the hospital again after two - four years.	5.772439118501747

Even after such dangerous surgeries when the patient feels complications then the advice to consume the medicine by increasing its dose is given.	4.954502932698927

If the patient adopts the habit of staying continuously in neural and beautiful environment of nature and uses vegetarian food then the permanent diagnosis of these problems may happen.	3.6911446379136255

Consume less oil and fat in food.	7.029550012896427

By doing yoga morning - evening , and doing sahaj exercise benefit is received.	5.457913451206649

Actually this is a natural treatment whose effect provides the body with the ability to make it free of all bodily diseases.	4.726365137481809

SAAOL that is , science and art of living , is a technique of treatment of heart based on natural treatment.	5.144895490684941

Under the SAAOL heart program the patents are not just given immediate relief but its permanent solution is done through natural medicine.	4.036058361468288

Then under SAAOL natural treatment habits of yoga in morning - evening and meditation etc are adopted.	5.111111743684539

In this treatment there is neither the need of eating medicine nor of getting surgery done.	5.435910763268044

Under this medication a training of three days is given to the heart patient.	6.761634579038199

The patients are kept in natural places away from the population.	7.055811408956483

During the training the habit of eating vegetarian food of less fat and to endure tension are taught.	4.563843417348808

Under this treatment along with yoga practice scientific information related to heart disease are also given.	5.033239124962213

Balanced and fatless food and regular exercise become his daily routine.	5.353750160554796

Why is natural treatment esteemed ? 	9.998496720977608

We have made even more than two and half thousand heart patients disease free with this natural treatment method.	4.722817791925617

After getting the treatment done through the natural treatment technique the patient becomes completely disease free.	5.9169504971551135

The special thing with natural treatment technique is this that the person adopts such habit that other diseases do not ever cross his path.	3.9442524045763734

Those people who after taking the training of natural treatment technique continue following its rules , the danger of heart problems can never occur to them.	4.394535972070921

Pimples of the head may make bald.	13.162295494847644

No matter in which part of the body the pimples develop , they are painful.	6.121999886861739

But if the pimples develop in the head then what can be said ! 	5.931992106034848

The pimples of the head , which in Ayurveda are called ` arunshika '.	6.9982731504574085

Due to pimples problems do occur but with this , situations of baldness , loss of memory , hair fall - hair greying , ill effects on the brain etc may also arise.	4.4235613174555235

Pimples may arise in any organ of the body.	6.54239664459234

After the eruption of the pimples intense pain is felt when they rupture on becoming ripe.	4.938640401436656

The pimple of the ear even makes everyone restless.	5.917909151195109

First injection in the quantity of 1 m.l., six weeks after this second and the third injection is given after 7 to 9 months.	5.268382092143149

With this vaccine for around four years immune power develops against its virus.	4.743931609223882

In this vaccine all the three types of viruses stay mixed diphtheria , tetanus and polio.	5.006024815960365

The creation of sabin vaccine is also through three viruses.	5.124197474721208

There is the provision of making the use of sabin vaccine through mouth at the interval of every 1 month continuously for three months three times in total.	4.90694801739917

Otherwise on the heart being disease infested he comes in the clutches of many types of heart related diseases.	5.513887234533904

Generally it is considered that the direct relation of heart diseases is with the increase in cholesterol.	6.301331497671542

As the quantity of cholesterol increases in body , the danger bell for heart gets rung.	5.552216159146904

But in modern experiments one such element has come to be known , which is considered to be far more lethal to the heart than the cholesterol.	4.686107398717536

This substance is - amino acid named homocystin which is four times more sticky substance than cholesterol.	4.786726519058646

This gets produced in the body during the process of digestion of food only without protein.	6.629175168234799

If its quantity gets increased in the body , then ill effects like blockage in the arteries , reduction in the work capacity of blood vessels have to be faced.	5.500316912045439

On the occurrence of homocystin in pregnant woman abortion , premature delivery , less weight of the child , the feet of the child being joined , line in the middle of the lips etc.may occur.	4.370478917505563

The quantity of homocystin keeps increasing for the entire life time.	5.00259213823226

The quantity of homocystin is more in comparison to women right from youth.	5.569840550844244

But the quantity of hommocystin gradually goes on decreasing with increasing age.	5.369742075013851

In fact the problem of increase of homocystin is found more in the age group of 20 - 30 years and is seen more in men.	5.348408586209668

In this also the percentage of Indians with this problem is more.	7.036790715949386

In the blood of man 5 - 15 MOL  L homocystin should be there.	4.7789936010012015

If homocystin is found even 5 percent more in man then the chance of heart attack increases three times.	5.696622549310453

Because of increase in homocystin the chances of death increases 50 percent due to disease of heart and 20 percent due to brain and neural diseases.	5.239962325205988

Therefore those people who have a family history of heart disease , for then getting the homocystin test may prove to be blessing.	5.276371696599552

Apart from this consumption of more coffee and alcohol.	5.075575037068943

Less walking , increase in bad cholesterol in blood.	7.068444127797441

The diseases occurring in rainy season.	6.637363108193026

Dysentery with blood - due to the consumption of polluted and contaminated water in rainy season and due to the weakness of stomach pain and spasm happen.	6.031630028867622

In order to remove this disease take poppy seed , dry ginger powder and candy sugar in equal quantity and make powder by breaking - grinding.	3.6432011085297242

Take this mixture one spoon each at the interval of every 3 hours.	4.076962432695844

By consuming three - four times a day with one cup water which has been boiled and cooled mucus , dysentery with blood and spasm and pain in stomach get stopped.	4.611413840671032

Till the time of benefit do not consume fried things , heavy things , hot tea , hot milk and salty substances.	4.610634021943755

The immune power to bear those matter and environment are not there in the body , due to the effect of that matter or environment there is reaction in the body and it is called allergy.	5.119120259151706

In rainy season due to the allergy because of polluted environment and substances in some people breathing or respiratory diseases occur.	5.012204183767322

To avoid this complication equal quantity of mulhathi and fine powder of turmeric should be mixed and half spoon should be taken with warm water two three times in a day.	3.815654680852863

By this method one gets riddance from disease like cold , respiratory diseases , dry cough etc and immune power develops in the body.	3.9144757853218186

Because of contamination of water in this season dysentery , vomiting appear separately or even together.	6.146706402263122

ANM bahanji had also said it that if the child faces difficulty in drinking mother 's milk or his breathing becomes fast then it would have to be taken to the hospital immediately.	5.0234835715557

Radha knows that there is complete nutrition in the milk of the mother.	7.081451795047547

Therefore for complete four months she fed Muniya with her own milk.	3.998069240472599

ORS , glucose or not even water , no matter how much hot or cold it had been.	5.527236121180185

In the initial days do not bathe the child only wipe with cloth.	4.492121059565974

Up to four months do not give anything other than mother 's milk.	5.625373956782118

Definitely take the weight of the child.	6.565141567160034

If the child has problem in drinking water or the breathing is fast then immediately take it to big hospital.	5.00781035609148

Exactly one and half months after birth Radha took Muniya to get the vaccine injected.	6.140138445323529

Behanji said that vaccine and doses save from six polio like diseases , therefore in getting the entire vaccine there should not be mistake.	4.494337421204321

Exactly after one month Muniya received vaccine and dose again.	5.790262652154899

Every vaccine was registered in the mother - child protection card and every time behanji reminded Radha of coming the next time for the vaccines.	4.3483750086414235

Behanji also told Radha that she should not forget at all the vaccine of diphtheria that would be put in the ninth month of Muniya.	4.478781741966289

Because of if the vaccine is not given to the child and if diphtheria occurs then after that diseases like dysentery , pneumonia , malnutrition and sarsaam etc.	4.973441089179029

But on the completion of ninth month Muniya got the vaccine of diphtheria and with it she also received the drops of vitamin A to save from night blindness.	3.662095068359517

She will continue getting the dose of vitamin A every six month up to three years.	5.14807711184256

This you should also remember that on the decided dates you must get the vaccine - dose given.	5.3414927272688155

Every time get the protection card filled.	7.178620964295504

Do not forget the vaccine of diphtheria on the completion of ninth month.	3.9127723117878053

Give the drops of vitamin A up to three years.	5.942158931012497

repeated.	65.02085256737196

Radha had fed Muniya with her own milk from the first month her birth and up to four months she had not given her anything apart from her milk.	3.7360549491313617

Every month Radha had to take the weight of Muniya.	7.70881207036087

On sixth month the weight of Muniya was twice from that at birth.	5.558615649423892

Radha became happy that the weight of Muniya had increased correctly according to the saying of A.N.M.behanji.	4.30863289836147

Then three - four times a day Radha started feeding Muniya half bowl of mashed chapatti , dal and vegetables.	4.828428329371186

And with it Radha also used to give green leafy vegetables , papaya and gourd so that night blindness does not occur to Muniya.	4.779636610446444

Now Muniya is of one year , today is her birthday.	7.506409405748083

Now her weight is three times of that at birth.	6.796370878664137

Every body at home are happy that nurturing of Muniya is happening in the correct manner.	4.8174620413066105

Now Radha feeds Muniya half bowl of food even five - six times in a day.	3.8656098402033248

You all should also remember that in six months the weight should be doubled.	5.7691783303622275

To the child of four to twelve months half bowl of food must be fed three - four times a day.	4.464646058621322

The weight should be three times on the completion of one year.	5.778283735788284

From twelve to eighteen months feed half bowl food five - six times a day.	3.71276273635354

One day Muniya started getting loose motion.	6.58425327839055

Radha became worried , she remembered the saying of A.N.M.behanji that because of repeated dysentery the water of the body and the salts come out and there may even be danger to his life.	4.147602008605795

Immediately as per told by bahanji Radha started giving liquid items found in the house repeatedly to Muniya.	5.413381357203627

But together with these things behanji had also asked to give O.R.S.but that there was no O.R.S.at home.	4.487387311924699

Sohan brought O.R.S.packet from anganwari.	7.274094832240086

Radha made O.R.S.solution according to the process told by A.N.M.bahanji.	5.463836996442924

And made Muniya drink after every dysentery.	6.906542208033226

Next day Radha threw the leftover solution and made fresh solution.	5.255746385541774

Apart from this she also continued feeding complete meal to Muniya.	4.355568456828639

In two - three days the dysentery stopped on its own and Muniya became alright.	5.743576191385441

Everyone should remember it always that as dysentery starts in child , keep giving domestic liquid things after every dysentery.	3.8381981660814968

Deficiency of water in body is very dangerous , therefore keep giving O.R.S.solution as well.	5.735031961716661

At least give half bowl of food four - five times in a day certainly and even after this there is dysentery then take her to health center.	4.749578081977396

The treatment of cough - cold may be done even in the house.	6.640911280725234

Therefore on contracting cold Radha treated Muniya this way.	5.163215726537734

By giving more and more things to drink and by feeding regularly.	5.889376719419061

Muniya became alright in three - four days.	8.267589354527036

But Radha thought if her condition would have become worse even after doing everything.	4.8921686963157995

Bahanji counselled that the meaning of such happening is pneumonia and there are three symptoms to recognize it stopping of food - drinks , fast breathing and rib movement.	4.5504620117070775

In such situation take the child to bahanji immediately and get her administered the medicine of pneumonia.	5.009239512546389

If bahanji tells then immediately go to big hospital and get her checked up.	5.168536756552873

If due to any reason you do not find bahanji then also take the child to big hospital immediately.	4.376682429757332

Muniya did not even become of one year that mother - in - law started expressing the desire for a grandson.	4.951888745396723

Radha asked bahanji , she said that it will take two to three years for the weakness that has come in the body after the birth of Muniya to go away.	5.482986758542537

As such if there is pregnancy then there may be problem as well as complication and the prospective child may also stay weak.	5.338565559983091

Also Muniya will stop getting mother 's milk and her care will also not be taken.	5.34077222260438

Radha understood , the meaning of more and frequent children is disease in the destiny of child , malnutrition and twelve months of money crunch.	4.787399272213676

Bahanji told easy and reliable ways of contraception.	7.271319475165047

After discussion Sohan and Radha chose the right way and decided that for three years they would not produce second child.	4.140173728984621

You should also remember that there should be a gap of three years between two children.	6.149418955740342

Conception before three years is bad for the health of mother and child.	6.845147620793984

For keeping gap between two children use condom , pills or copper - T.	5.194732597340137

On stopping the these methods second child may be given birth to.	6.348692459015663

One day some people did a counsel after coming to the village , Radha and Sohan also went , the discussion happened regarding the stopping of disease through hygiene.	3.690292636316609

After toilet putting soil or ash over it.	5.723782299927651

After washing the hands properly only feeding the child and using clean water.	6.394708719233626

To protect food from dirt and flies.	6.45306593142568

Burning the garbage of the household or burying it in the ground.	6.170100174534465

Not letting water accumulate near well or hand pump.	6.753514558899165

Through all these things the prevention of diseases may happen to a great extent.	5.992188131220096

Everybody liked the talks and with the help of institution and panchayat people completed these together.	4.87075612548698

Sohan and Radha in fact even swore to ward off dirt and disease.	4.601596055800137

After some days the result also came in front , as dirt lessened the diseases too started reducing.	3.8228349300743885

Diabetes has taken the form of an epidemic in the world and its various kinds of social and financial adverse effects are also coming forward.	4.273033306048759

In the patients of diabetes diabetes foot is an extremely serious problem.	6.075871208839722

Thus in the whole world in every 30 seconds surgery of amputating the foot of a certain patient afflicted with diabetes foot takes place.	4.947853176166319

My intention of telling you these figures is not to frighten you , but to caution you.	4.134016737304215

By researches done in this regard it has been proved that by good care it is possible to escape from the problem of diabetes foot to great extent.	5.642264294914262

The ancient proverb of Prevention is better than cure is absolutely successful in diabetes disease.	4.731119188526163

There is a chance of occurrence of ulcer in feet to the patients of diabetes due to the following two reasons.	5.704385089814342

In the patients of diabetes because of damage occurring in the nervous system there is decline in capability to feel in their feet and they do not feel pain at all due to which wound or injury in feet does not get detected in time.	4.324710944382944

In patients of diabetes because of flaccid blood circulation wounds or injuries heal late and on occurrence of a small wound danger of infection keeps lurking.	4.2333045097362545

Such people whose blood level is high can suffer from diabetes foot.	5.197346076722417

To prevent these complications aid of heart vessel and pancreas transplant and laser photocoagulation can be taken.	3.878149197943096

Due to these chances of occurrence of blindness , disfigurement and premature death can be there.	4.65157528935011

Diabetes of pregnancy can prove to be harmful for mother and child both.	4.891745741798211

The complications of diabetes can be stopped from increasing.	5.522393107909419

Through blood pressure control , intensive lipid management and anti-platelet therapy these complications can be reduced in a significant manner.	4.641156364481803

These complications can be stopped in a significant manner by keeping a strict control on all these abnormal processes and expense that is incurred on the patient is also less.	4.516727782555435

Cure of diabetes and related complications is expensive.	8.517240107975825

An expense of about Rs.5000 can come every year on the treatment of a patient.	5.966137535411677

Cure can be more expensive if complications of patient increase else he has to be admitted to the hospital.	5.203110713786465

There is an expense of more than Rs.20,000 crore on the therapy of Indian diabetes patients.	4.6348667341577485

A strict control on the glucose level of diabetes patient is difficult because the danger of occurrence of hypoglycemia in them can increase by it.	5.113347058118803

By new medicines like insulin analog , inhaled insulin , peptide-I exenatide like glucagon , meglitinide derivative , DPP-IV inhibitors control of level of glucose can be done without the danger of hypoglycemia.	3.940233204385696

Despite of being acquainted with advantages of strict control on glucose , blood pressure control and lipid control only 30-40 % patients are able to have this control and out of these also only 10 % patients are able to have control over all of these.	3.6688480657509612

It is necessary to spread information about researches that happen on diabetes and control related cures on a massive level.	3.596664937780304

If diabetes and its complications are not stopped from taking a dreadful form then in a developing country like India catastrophic circumstances can originate.	3.882997142474758

Currently number of diabetes patients in India is about 370 lakh.	8.327088632840022

There is a chance of this number increasing to become about 860 lakh in 2030.	4.750377184749535

There are a number of reasons behind cases of diabetes increasing suddenly in India.	4.620285226382012

Having congenital reasons , having much weight , imitation of western lifestyle , sensitivity , stomach fat and insulin resistance with less weight.	3.793188040636513

Diabetes can affect various body parts.	7.183759665884305

Nervous system , eyes , kidneys , bones , etc.also have not escaped this epidemic.	4.956994021587332

By diabetes disorders can occur in bones , joints and muscles and nerves.	6.864591574996568

Because of which stiffness in joints - swelling , ulcers in feet , decaying of feet else feet can become dark.	4.073699413381141

If proper control is not kept over diabetes then bone related diseases can occur.	4.811503456494728

If an elderly woman is afflicted with category - I diabetes then danger of bone breaking increases by it.	4.342761065948839

If bone breaks then it takes a long time for it to join.	6.9605531308063435

In addition to this bones become basically weak because due to deficiency in insulin developmental process of bones stops.	4.086827531672148

This does not happen in category - II diabetes afflicted as most of the patients of this category are fat as a result of which their bones are also big and strong.	4.241362411478374

Hence patients of category - I require an average of 1200 mg Calcium and 400 to 600 units ' vitamin - D ' everyday.	4.529104089086488

Dose of osteoporosis is necessary for patients of category -1 like common patients.	8.14605710357131

According to an interesting research if baby is given ' vitamin - D ' then danger of occurrence of category - 1 diabetes reduces.	4.734972074260842

There is more chance of occurrence of infection to patients of diabetes.	5.038338078002394

Various deformities and mortality rate can increase in patients due to infection.	5.624318183324763

There can be various reasons for its basis.	5.433152514420845

Immunity reducing , nerves of body or nervous system getting affected negatively , glucose level increasing in skin.	4.890851495461978

The level of amount of glucose in skin exceeding 150 , danger of bone infection increases.	5.482592215297512

Hence controlled amount of glucose is necessary in surgeries related to bones like joint transplant and treatments like joining or setting a broken bone.	3.8456068330112676

If level of glycosylated hemoglobin increases by 2 % then by that danger of occurrence of abscess or ulcer increases by 1.6 % and danger of amputating a body part increases by 1.5 %.	4.207567671739607

Here it is reasonable to discuss the topic of diabetes and infection of feet because it is found so in most cases.	5.014285967626321

Due to the reason that sensory nerves get damaged , the feeling of hot and cold and injury in feet gets reduced and feet get continually damaged.	4.571228724640284

By damage of nerves that are manager of muscles there can be paralysis in feet , feet can become deformed or twisted.	4.858822975146546

By exertion of more pressure on less space chance of formation of ulcer increases.	5.852527161600721

In this manner by damage of nerves that control the temperature of skin , skin gets worse.	4.953283381942962

Because of blockage in the blood circulation of feet proper nutrition is unable to reach the feet and less white blood cells reach there.	6.342002880500683

Hence immunity becomes less.	13.505861474055546

Bone diseases occurring due to diabetes are in this manner :.	8.281535253898683

Weakening of bones , change coming in the walk , balance of body is not maintained by blockage of nerves occurrence of decrease in immunity , wound not filling up fast , getting an infection again and again from wound not healing and consequently from these diseases starting from handicap of patient even death can occur.	3.515151445742871

Because of diabetes infection of feet begins from the soles of feet.	4.857488057657945

In the beginning there is a redness in skin which remains even after pressing.	5.408533844600239

Skin gets tough.	21.192181057514706

There can be formation of ulcer by injury in foot that reaches the muscles and bones and pus can develop in foot , fingers can degenerate or darken.	3.8931803351584695

You should cure patient immediately , surgery and amputation of foot are also combined in the treatment.	4.770491957427501

Infection of foot because of diabetes is a state of emergency.	7.494390021660471

It is necessary to do the amputation of foot in 80 % of the cases and treatment of patient on admitting in hospital in 20 % of the cases.	4.383561409305806

In Indian patients cause of 12 % cases of ulcer in feet is diabetes.	5.15871649375819

There is influence on joints because of diabetes.	6.525255038038362

Disease named ` Charcot joint ` can occur to 1 out of 600 patients of patients afflicted with diabetes.	5.7109642819475965

The difference between infection and Charcot is this that in Charcot feet of patients are red , swollen , and twisted and patient does not have any pain in it and patient does not have fever.	4.638320567302155

A specific kind of test might be necessary to detect ` Charcot joint `.	5.1445345377908644

Aid of diabetes control glucose control in blood , plaster of a specific shape , shoes and surgery can be taken in the treatment.	5.1079097271554765

Danger of infection during surgery can also increase because of diabetes.	6.7601435952788185

It takes time for the bone to join in diabetes.	6.3009562076382375

As a result of the bone breaking often deformity can occur in joints also.	4.845207394644364

Skin of hands of patients of diabetes becomes thick , stiff like wax and dried up.	5.394494903856991

Fingers of hands stiffen and snap on bending.	6.3008833621568785

This is also called ' trigger finger '.	9.563812075892821

The whole hand on some patients gets twisted then distortion comes in forefinger of some patients which is known by the name of ' dupuytren '.	3.7912196705258934

Because of these difficulties patients can not even perform the action of namaskar properly.	4.613772227281831

Aid of exercise , injection of steroid in nerves and hands and surgery is taken for treatment.	3.7732887912100983

Normally shoulders of both arms get jammed else stiffness occurs in them because of which patients can not even comb their hair.	5.225129154452209

Patients become unsuccessful in rotating their arms behind their waist or above.	4.739471077656425

It takes a long time for such patients to recover.	7.261581019804465

Aid of exercise , injection of steroid in joints , telescope or general surgery is taken for treatment.	3.2493162654308976

Nerves get deformed due to diabetes.	7.920855224120473

Blockage occurs in blood circulation in vessels by excess of glucose in blood and other defects can also arise in vessels because of which most patients lose balance related control of sense and body.	4.334568657683408

Many problems like shock in hands and feet , feeling a burning sensation , in hands and feet going numb , occurrence of paralysis and fingers getting distorted can originate.	4.123708276862098

Defect can also arise in the muscles of feet and patient is unable to walk properly.	6.638760119654781

Occurrence of problem like compression of nerve by thickening and stiffening of skin near and inside joints and by blood circulation not occurring normally is a common symptom.	3.7704775668084

Mostly nerves of wrists can compress , by compression of medial nerve of wrist ' carpal tunnel syndrome ' occurs.	3.5907816450331502

In this pain , shock and numbness which usually increases at night time occur in thumb and with it in two and a half fingers.	4.173924582121423

This difficulty can also happen to patients of diabetes by working on the computer in a wrong position or working much , holding the newspaper , etc..	4.880926749188073

This problem occurs more in patients of diabetes in those doing work related to much bending and rotating of wrist.	4.962591340139458

The treatment of every problem in diabetes starts with control of glucose in blood through medicines.	4.743245160894139

Hence control on amount of glucose is vital to prevent adverse effects on nerves because of diabetes.	4.749417124693935

In addition to this treatment is done by pain killers , vitamins , pancreas transplant.	4.976700586113643

Disease of kidneys occurring due to diabetes is called nephropathy.	6.882358621778517

This disease is detected in diabetes patients when protein products in urine are found to be 500 mg on running a urine test.	4.537420189338833

In comparison to white people the chance of occurrence of diabetes generated kidney disease in Asian Indians is 40 times more.	4.052191138374988

The danger of kidney and heart disease to such patients is more.	6.986271552442302

This disease can be stopped via initial diagnosis and proper treatment of disease.	4.99574747116081

The following are the causes of diabetes generated kidney disease.	5.109636011953169

Having disease of diabetes for a long time.	8.225327758764378

Not having a proper control on blood glucose.	5.328694926664686

High blood pressure , heredity , race , smoking etc.can also be causes of diabetes generated kidney disease.	4.603680835942518

Diabetes generated kidney disease occurs because of protein urea on increase in amount of protein in urine and glomerular filtration rate G.F.R.	4.839665588850932

The main cause of diabetes generated kidney disease is uncontrolled level of blood glucose in body.	3.7458466614106296

However imbalance of blood glucose in body is harmful for cells and other body parts which can become a cause of various kinds of ailments.	5.518542886293932

Hence it is possible to prevent diabetes generated kidney disease to quite an extent keeping level of blood glucose controlled in diabetes patients and diagnosing the disease on the preliminary level and detecting microalbumin urea in the urine.	3.4486209711765956

Urine of 24 hours is tested to detect microalbumin urea.	6.153378822917737

This is the most reliable test for detecting microalbumin urea.	5.469714549038099

Preliminary prevention is having control on blood glucose.	7.502235313061629

The normal level of HbA1C blood glucose is Up to 7 %.	4.692848422220802

Chances of other complications arising because of diabetes remain less till this level but on HbA1c being more than 7 % all relative efforts should be made to control blood glucose.	4.335270343849686

Conclusively you can say that diabetes generated kidney disease is the main cause of kidney failure.	5.589620655214394

Hence diabetes patients should keep doing their regular check-up so that preliminary diagnosis of the diabetes generated kidney disease is possible and through relative treatment the disease is stopped from advancing.	4.86504111799602

In both there is adverse effect on processes of various body parts like metabolism nervous system by defect in insulin and increase in glucose level and immunity system and skin also gets affected by it.	4.044338511825301

However in most of the cases causes of changes that occur in skin remain unknown.	4.888495877171501

Because of occurrence of defect in vessels , nerves or because of decrease in immunity in body due to excess of glucose and imbalanced level of insulin skin related disease occur in diabetes patients.	4.452583734109475

Because of diabetes such substances get accumulated below skin and inside skin by which skin becomes thick and tough.	4.2080405091525215

Because of diabetes activities of joints become limited.	6.198976661655725

In some patients due to accumulation of proteins in the fingers of hands and feet there is inconvenience in trying to move them and their efficiency is affected badly.	3.807618611240502

Various types of wounds and injuries occur in feet and legs on increase in level of glucose in blood or not consuming the medicines properly.	4.5859510976651565

Because of these wounds and injuries a specific kind of fluid gets stored in the arteries.	4.526032775212307

In some cases blood circulation can lessen or stop in the skin of body.	5.376385758693645

Because of diabetes deep wounds that are non-healing occur.	5.0599828371262605

Efficiency of nervous system gets adversely affected by excess of glucose in arteries that convey blood to the nervous system.	5.108698532842001

As a result of which that organ or part of body goes numb and injury in numbed parts can not be detected and the danger of occurrence of infection in the wound is retained.	4.519726166545332

The family planning program was started in the country from 1951.	6.6133507170782835

Its aim was only to plan the population.	7.56300660049033

Afterwards for the attainment of the missions of the program it started being used for mass education and propaganda.	4.704965757731973

In the decade of seventies by stressing on vasectomy extreme strictness was done in the achievement of goals.	3.811929566582095

As a result opposition was produced among masses towards family planning program.	4.083055308111479

During the seventh plan year 1985 - 90 in place of the family planning program the program was given the identity of family welfare.	4.839971560831952

In this special emphasis was given on the health related needs of women of reproductive age and children of less than five years.	5.027994944129942

In 1985 - 86 pervasive vaccination was started.	8.973435984810388

In pervasive vaccination the aim was fixed to bring down the death rate and sickness of young children from such diseases whose prevention is possible through vaccines.	4.163230206963919

Thereafter by looking at the benefits of this program in the decade of nineties child safety and safe motherhood C.S.S.M.was prepared and implemented from 1992 - 93.	3.6469044305029

In the present times all the family welfare services continuing from before were kept implemented.	4.092575481791561

In it reproductive health , youth health , sex generated disease , infection of reproductive system and AIDS were included.	3.93628536576193

It was given the name of reproduction and child health.	6.150192075982932

Reproduction and child health program was implemented in the region.	6.678514103438178

In the place of goal oriented method from the year 1997 community needs are ascertained on the basis of assessment policy.	4.296282546085823

The work plan of health workers only would be the base of all the plans.	6.232269013071141

After unifying the plans created on the sub centres it would be given the form of district work plan.	5.725616881194073

The district work plans together would take the form of state work plan.	5.708116178432703

In order to supply the goods to state the national plan would be based on the state work plan.	3.653330575889889

The partner plan is the form of proposal.	11.192942848155736

The principle essay of the ninth plan published by the planning commission has been written.	4.0652635149186125

It is written in it that the government investment during the eighth plan for family welfare is reducing.	4.622958950854706

The extra expenditure of the eighth plan has also been less than that of the seventh plan.	5.167265161477566

This situation looks even more unsatisfactory.	7.371158365217039

At every level there is a need of upliftment of health care system.	5.539559438017009

The health care program should be made to reach to more and more people.	5.075002283052561

So that at the end the national goal may be achieved.	6.674558396687187

However because of the economic development , spread of education  literacy and due to the rights given to the citizens there has been a constant improvement in the program in the past years.	5.601004661180165

In the states with less execution many problems are present in relation to weak implementation , because of the women not receiving enough rights and education  literacy.	4.746063223101457

Under the reproduction and health program the solution to these problems would be achieved through the following strategy.	4.81662305057438

In the population and development conference in the country of Egypt the proposal for the unification of reproduction and child health R.C.H.programs were tabled.	3.5131964821420625

In the reproduction and child health policy it has been emphasized on this thing that people should have the power to control reproductive force.	4.930109597659275

Couple should be able to keep sexual relation without the fear of conception or disease.	6.613697236045397

Accordingly the mission of the ninth plan was kept that all the related programs of eighth plan would be unified.	3.756951296243479

before independence the situation of drought and hunger used to generally arise in our country.	5.533251510228641

Today due to the reason of mentionable achievements in the field of agriculture in the past decades the production of cereals , vegetables and fruits has increased many times.	4.9250599428926325

But unfortunately in the country the rate of population increase has advanced faster than the rate of increase of cereals.	5.761608120134337

The growth of population has happened more in the section of poor people only.	5.15632612565739

Due to this some very well off people became unhealthy because of over nutrition.	4.0585744224014215

That problem of malnutrition is looming even today in front of the maximum poor population.	5.705459698479183

Poverty and lack of purchasing power are chief reasons for malnutrition of a large section of population of our country.	4.575910306548901

Due to this even the eye sight of the child may also go.	6.743814282606909

Due to the deficiency of vitamin A there is high risk of contracting other infections as well.	4.1883917236675385

There should not be the deficiency of vitamin A by eating green leafy vegetables like lettuce , pot herb , mustard , cabbage , radish , gram lentil.	4.307431440734063

The fruits and vegetables of yellow color like mango , papaya , carrot and gourd are beneficial in removing the deficiency of vitamin A.	4.493406857295897

Children of less weight are born to mothers suffering from anemia.	5.108011789862091

The quantity of hemoglobin of mother at the time of birth is less than 8 then the weight of the child at the time of birth may be very less.	4.488617879844967

For such women there is need of A.N.C.	7.677894202674822

The child having less weight at the time of birth depends on the nutritional condition of the mother.	3.547066414978437

In sickness the child gets help from mother 's milk in becoming alright.	6.588454872971494

While feeding the child special attention should be given to the child for cleanliness.	6.921037173175409

The child should be fed till the time he does not start asking for food on his own.	4.494295429542527

Approximately 33 percent children are of less weight at the time of birth less than 2.5 kilogram.	5.0798580687555095

But within 6 months this rate remains 15 percent.	8.392600465802895

Such happens because in all the communities there has been validity of feeding up to six months of birth.	5.015033443879242

The child keeps getting nutritive substance from the milk of the mother.	4.308562602700424

The weight of children of the age group of 6 - 11 months and 12 - 23 months gets reduced under weight again.	4.8870022761600955

Its first reason is that starting to give other food materials apart from mother 's milk long before six months.	3.9555091525119908

Or else not starting to give any other food materials apart from mother 's milk even after six months.	3.8821419729309885

its second reason is , due to the reason of infection increase in the rate of disease morbidity rate.	6.776037604787738

In order to escape from both these problems it is essential that the family members should be given the information about nutrition education.	4.800931570115774

the children of 2 - 5 years generally start eating.	9.981998083796572

Due to this improvement comes also in children born with less weight.	4.635397734651108

The information of availability of nutritive substances at low price should be given to the families of children of this age group.	4.223980718609662

This information is imparted under various programs like woman and child development department and family welfare programs.	4.7283308990749955

They are distributed medical tests and nutritive diet under the mid - day meal program and school health program.	3.858806498842514

the children who do not go to school stay devoid of this.	6.212507695949247

In the ninth five year plan the registration of all the children in the school , continuation of the mid - day program and test of the weight of children and disease should be arranged.	4.937151510517284

In youth the physical and mental growth occur very fast.	5.960347502089375

In youth there is requirement of various nutritive elements.	5.355487443732343

Sufficient attention is not given on the nutrition of people of this age group.	6.098310023553821

Nutritive food is the mantra for good health.	6.581830854059608

the strength to fight against disease is obtained from food.	6.7515556031221875

The child of the body also needs this strength.	8.669344448490676

For this the most important are vitamin A and iron elements.	6.700454344204544

At least three to four times in a week the child should be given vitamin A rich food.	5.847726047759527

Every second day half bowl of lentils should be fed.	6.840953462458838

Due to this there would not be any deficiency of vitamin A.	4.644592737581519

In rural districts also the facility of anganbari is available.	6.475406438822401

the girls are also in need of that much of food as the boys.	5.905573284806542

generally it has been seen that in comparison to boys less attention is paid in the upbringing of girls.	5.909914722667401

It is said that later on boys have to earn.	4.66546407735363

The boys will only fulfil the major responsibilities of the house.	4.736119692075253

While apart from the responsibilities of the house the girls have to give birth to children later on.	5.188246118559685

If the girls are weak then post marriage their children will also be weak.	5.597307118700266

If the vicious cycle of early marriage and less birth duration is maintained then the prospective children would be weak.	3.787379634332401

Therefore how much important nutritious food is for boys that much it is also for girls.	5.517941819860038

Vitamin A has high importance for child.	6.464379830086536

H.I.V. AIDS is a lethal disease which is produced by H.I.V.meaning human deficiency virus.	4.4899442646661205

At present there are no vaccine or medicines for treatment for cure against this disease.	4.829170338609363

H.I.V.is an acquired infection.	6.354299031166698

The infection is received by man due to his activities from outside.	5.390170126003914

When the person gets infected with this virus once then the virus starts weakening his immunity system.	4.429106826083893

there are many such microbes which stay in body and environment.	8.404896744205423

Due to normal immunity system of the body the microbes do not produce any harm to the body.	5.524222546810729

Because of the weakening of the immunity system of the person suffering from H.I.V. A.I.D.S.the opportunist infections make use of the situation.	4.051751814435051

These develop in the form of signals and symptoms meaning syndrome.	7.49108181770563

In India there has been only 11 years of H.I.V. AIDS.	6.108092199071591

In this very small time this disease has developed in the form of the most serious health problem of the country.	6.04036963656397

This disease has spread rapidly in its nearby areas.	6.656424701200669

In 1996 the joint cases of Maharashtra , Tamil Nadu and Manipur were 77 percent of the total cases of India.	3.973829430049047

50 percent out of this was reported in the state of Maharashtra alone.	6.229000986481302

According to the report the patients of H.I.V.infection and AIDs are only few thousands.	4.855497701379949

There is huge difference between this figure and actual figure.	5.090721693159305

This infection has reached to the community by those people who keep adventurous behavior.	5.535180926499055

White blood corpuscles are our security warriors who destroy the microbes of diseases.	4.615040353720695

The active virus of AIDS destroy the white blood corpuscles because of diseases immune capacity is destroyed.	4.906279511657824

Ill effects have been seen of this situation on the child welfare and safe maternal program started by the government some years back.	5.069904194803544

Continuous reduction has come in the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate.	5.116167440740268

In this disease due to the rapid spread in mother and children ill effects can be seen.	5.086210224244568

The reason for the rapid spread of AIDS is the low level of literacy.	4.2609881868038855

Due to the low level of literacy the group of dangerous behavior does not become aware and becomes the reason of the spreading of H.I.V.	3.7328620591465715

Sexually transmitted diseases , sex distinction , infection of the reproductive organs of males and female etc are the reasons of the spread of AIDS disease.	4.910739896746914

In the sexually transmitted method the transmission of H.I.V.Be it sexual or oral happens due to unprotected sex.	4.168285461481202

In both the types of sexual activities there is transmission of virus from the infected person to their sexual partner.	4.014376841225426

The transmission of H.I.V.does not occur through the following - by shaking hands , by the patient using toilets , urinals , through mosquitoes and flies.	4.510662874881061

By drinking water and eating food from the same vessel as used by the infected patient also does not become the cause of the disease of AIDS.	5.333491395055746

By the use of joint goods like water , food , clothes , cups , glasses , plate , spoons etc.	4.263848199200314

The transmission of AIDS is not possible by the bite that mosquito which has earlier bitten the person infected with H.I.V.	4.377288260597657

By looking after and serving the infected person.	6.433403400138334

By the embrace or kiss of the infected person.	5.09820802322911

By sitting close to infected Peron , coughing or sneezing.	4.7140993025679165

AIDS does not even spread through blood donation.	6.691361932789553

If caution is practiced then AIDS will not spread.	6.495678005657357

If you abstain from sexual relation with unknown female sex worker and use nirodh then you can be saved from AIDS.	4.465972935188221

take immediate medical advice on even slight doubt.	7.159991902945444

The reason of not feeding colostrums first milk to the child -.	4.578544726100482

Colostrums is thrown because people say that it is accumulated stale milk of 5 - 6 months , this will harm the child.	5.229574086578651

Therefore in place of colostrums people give the first diet of tonic , milk , honey and water , powder milk etc.	4.2946557522050535

First milk is beneficial to the child but what is the benefit it is not known.	8.441610771694988

To encourage mother so that she starts feeding the child her own milk immediately after birth.	5.283576302194433

What is colostrums ? 	16.992260050347035

Why is it essential to feed colostrums ? 	7.219092600214732

How should the baby be fed the milk so that the lactation can be fast ? 	5.029738572454657

The first milk of mother is thick , yellow and sticky substance , which is called colostrums or first milk.	5.132505483590709

It is essential to give colostrums to the child.	5.173727883953441

Immediately after the birth within 1 hour certainly feed it your milk.	5.857136816485218

This thick and yellow milk is the elixir for the child.	6.277619364865655

The natural substances present in it save it from contracting dysentery , cold , cough etc diseases.	4.65904139064062

In this the vitamin A substance beneficial for the child is present in huge quantity.	6.562678885235438

It helps in the expulsion of the black faeces of the child.	5.300069823161193

Never understand this that the first secreted milk is bad or indigestible.	6.54698721853972

This is a wrong thought , on the contrary the substances which are quick to digest are found in more quantity which is suitable for the new born baby.	3.968873681086955

After delivery it comes out for two three days with the milk of the mother.	4.613425785208418

Many times the child is not able to suck the breast properly , but keep trying , it will very quickly.	4.1953302333094316

Whether milk comes out or not let the baby suck both the breasts certainly for at least half an hour one after the other , do such many times , the mother will start lactating the very first day.	3.925558064877805

During the breast feeding the full part of areola the dark portion around the nipple should be inside the mouth of the child.	4.065478992110098

When the child will suck the dark part then the mother 's milk will be secreted fast and will be produced more.	4.732805124578812

Giving tonic , making honey lick , giving the solution of sugar and water to the new born baby are old customs and traditions.	4.706476677635178

Doing such is harming the child.	9.294023452109075

Do not give cow milk , buffalo milk , goat milk by mixing with water to the new born baby.	3.6489801260998007

This may harm the baby.	10.382906236435339

Give to the child only the mother 's milk.	8.889550322014108

The common symptoms of the deficiency of water in children are increase of thirst , lack of tears , dryness of lips and tongue , becoming restless and irritated , drying up of the skin of the body , reduction of elasticity in them , if pinched then the pinch staying as before etc.	4.009940889135567

The serious symptoms of the deficiency of water in children are the child becoming unconscious , deepening of the eyes , dryness , lack of tears , becoming excessive weak , deepening of palate , excessive reduction or stopping of urine.	3.899743098430266

Approximately three fourth of the total weight of the body of children is water.	8.424718614557136

Due to the reason of dysentery the water and minerals from the body are lost which is called dehydration.	6.435981936525921

Due to loss of water and minerals in excessive quantity even the death of the child can take place.	6.392712332871827

Generally due to dysentery the child may become the victim of malnutrition.	7.666723149448522

Very less or less urine , the color of the urine becomes dark yellow.	5.794268882556381

There is sudden and rapid loss of weight.	6.925843560499499

The sign of pinch stays for long in the skin.	6.046224569257937

If the skin does not come in normal state after being pinched then the child is suffering from dehydration.	5.720870950008212

The microbes which cause dysentery harm the intestines of the body.	5.175684989059241

The power of the intestines to digest and absorb the food gets lost or lessened.	4.531724452495694

Due to this reason the intestines do not get time to absorb useful substances in food.	4.089947684106723

Due to this reason the child becomes victim of lack of nutrition or malnutrition.	5.127043232579053

Malnutrition reduces the diseases immune capacity of the body.	5.404725708067003

Malnourished child becomes victim of dysentery and other infectious diseases repeatedly and frequently y..	6.014589269534375

This way dysentery from malnutrition and malnutrition from dysentery occurs.	5.435110353116669

With water as well many essential elements are removed from the body due to which malnutrition becomes even more sinister.	6.118731156810099

Simple dysentery that is when there is no sign of dehydration then for stopping the expected dehydration treatment can be done by giving domestic liquid items and easily digestible food materials.	4.516370529730078

In dysentery easily digestible things like chhachh , salted lassi , coconut water , lemon water , vegetable soup , fruit juice , shikanji , jowar water etc should be given in large quantity.	3.8227855577841714

These thing can be given to children younger than two years every time one quarter or half glass and children older than two years every time one glass.	3.897551433536385

To grown up children give khichri , dalia , mashed vegetables , like potato and fruits like papaya and banana , rice , pulses , egg , fish and well cooked meat.	3.611416147565447

Dr.Chitra Pai , chief of the microbiology department of the hospital said that on the mobile phones maximum 54.6 percent ' staphylococcus accrues ' bacteria were found.	3.484729299847269

This microbe can become the cause of skin disease.	8.076263447871602

Apart from this in mobile phones microbes like E - Coli and pseudomonas were also found.	3.4911620851529896

Due to the infection of E - Coli and pseudomonas microbes maximum ill effect is seen on the health.	4.381719875352576

Two years back in a study done in Coiambatore the presence of 96.2 percent microbes was found on the phones of hospital workers.	4.659568075056711

First let me tell you as to what are antioxidants ? 	6.359335109368892

As our age passes some or the other type of loss occurs in our body.	4.72092106050322

We generally see that some people appear old before age while some appear comparitively young even at the age of 80 years.	3.6891593731203516

The answer to this is with modern medical science and this answer is the deficiency of antioxidant in our food.	5.5764608469057455

All around us there is pollution , tensile environment and many among us smoke cigarette actively.	4.618156307311361

All this speed up the process of destruction in body after uniting.	6.062782741527878

Even the diseases of the heart to great extent can be due to this destructive process.	6.671833119517425

Just like the rust on the iron exposed in air which occurs due to oxidation the cause of the destruction in the body is also oxygen and tissues  the chemical reaction of the enzymes.	4.607328401321143

The accumulated fat in the arteries of the heart L.D.L.Cholesterol gets oxidised before getting accumulated.	4.981280958956841

Antioxidants are micronutrient substances which stop the destruction occurring in the tissues and organs of the body.	3.5779905497473963

Therefore these have immense capacity to keep the disease of the heart at bay and for its treatment reversal.	5.764661827181405

Along with antioxidants there are other substances as well which are essential to make the food complete which help our heart and other organs and make our body healthy and increase the immune capacity of our body.	4.127829335739046

This collection of the information of heart , throw light on these food making it complete.	5.299488800735134

This is the wonder food of future antioxidants.	5.957270857888187

In continuous fast life generally man is left devoid of nutrition or else stays dependent on diet consisting of less nutrition.	3.804765777746946

In this relation can we think something for ourselves or our family instead.	4.236057695611569

This is that portion of knowledge related to nutrition which has been specially created for us.	4.548395254511529

Every capsule of this knowledge give us information about vitamins and minerals , which are important for our health.	4.236874843614835

What are free radicals ? 	11.667526206221424

In what way do these harm human body ? 	5.128153237094916

In what way Vitamin E and other antioxidant nutritive substances protect the body from the destruction of free radicals.	3.9685476582777737

We will try to give answers to these questions and will tell that fruits and vegetables rich in 5 - 8 types of antioxidants may be beneficial for your health.	4.045825386371518

For the knowledge of this thing that how free radicals and antioxidants react with each other , little bit of knowledge is essential in the subject of tissues and molecules.	4.621051929232366

Physiology , for the revision of chemistry brief chapters have been given here.	5.516744923877781

Human body is made up of various types tissues and tissues are made up of various types of molecules.	4.612588155930743

In molecules there may be one or more atoms which remain tied due to chemical bond.	4.864399861608726

In atom there are nucleus , neutron , proton and electron.	5.623576312873649

Electrons participate in chemical reactions and keep the atom tied in the form of molecule.	6.748423339504463

Electron keeps the atom surrounded in one or many shells.	7.6243094135848475

Certainly oxygen element is extremely important for life , but in some conditions it is even harmful for human body.	4.999789175189868

Due to the reactivity of oxygen many harmful compounds are formed.	4.648929361508463

These are called the compounds of reactive oxygen species.	5.0687353843913785

Reactive oxygen compound give oxygen to other substances according to their own nature.	5.745255822968652

Many out of these reactive species are free radicals and consist of one or more extra electron.	5.720260771609791

This way because of the lack of similar compounds it is the cause of instability and extreme reactivity.	6.696759316875545

Oxygen atom is the cause of the reason of ageing , heart disease , stiffening of the artery , the reason of loss of immune capacity , damage of free radicals.	4.693785743066349

Due to these losses the conditions of stiffness of the arteries , diabetes , cataract and premature agreeing arise.	4.228722244044045

The contribution of antioxidant is extremely effective in the prevention of cancer , heart disease , Alzheimer 's disease , rheumatism and cataract.	4.74128292677277

Together with different oxidants these work in different cellular compartments.	5.400211903656743

The system of enzyme is an important aspect of immunity capacity , glutathione peroxidise , superoxide dismutase and catalase etc which reduce the accumulation of some harmful oxidants in the tissues.	3.814736904657666

Some essential minerals are - selenium , copper , manganese and zinc etc are essential for the production of the activity of the live enzymes.	4.4239790209554135

Another security line of the immune capacity of the body towards the harm of the free radicals is the presence of antioxidants.	5.205930063173216

Antioxidants is a molecule which is at least so stable that they can give one electron to free radicals and make them inert so that their capacity to harm is lessened.	4.298364080313805

Some antioxidants of this type are antioxidants , glutatione ubiquinol and uric acid which are produced during the normal metabolism of the body.	4.35388153372595

Though till now around 9000 antioxidants have been detected.	6.767733190698959

The most popular antioxidants are Vitamin E , Vitamin C and carotenoids.	5.564442718985463

Tissues of oxygen free radicals oxygen free radicals are produced during digestion.	5.994185847932487

These poisonous molecules of tissues are produced in the body due to the cause of the light of the sun , x - ray radiation , food , tobacco or the smoke of car and other pollutants of the atmosphere.	4.780706063790401

In fact these free radicals harm DNA that is the ones providing hereditary characteristics.	4.971049753048275

Microbes convert chemical compounds and at times completely destroy the tissues.	6.447145214926117

With the help of antioxidants the compensation of this damage can be done.	4.628709699389509

In which way can the antioxidants protect from the harm occurring due to the frss radicals ? 	5.543211416265502

The ones providing immunity are the antioxidants substances.	7.149776618178667

As it is clear from the name antioxidants are those substances which stop the destruction occurring in the body and normalise the oxidation process occurring in the tissues of the organisms.	3.6940416707515027

These nutritive substance vitamin and mineral are enzymes the supportive protein in the chemical reactions situated in the body.	3.879773781880013

It is believed that these protect from the ill effects of the free radicals.	4.140379669887789

By donating their personal electron the antioxidants depress the process of stealing electron by the free radicals.	4.101668645602208

After shunning the electron also they do not become free radical because in themselves they have stability.	5.153138958934837

Antioxidants stop the process of oxidation , by deactivating the free radicals.	5.1968595113056315

In doing such the oxidation of them takes place.	6.471853916567392

Though you take multivitamin regularly , consume extra vitamin C , many types of fruits , vegetables , then also it is not essential that you are getting sufficient antioxidant.	5.387659856491346

With respect to these nutritive substances fighting cancer , health enhancer specialists have given opinion.	4.650050544660209

here such substances are being named which should be taken in daily breakfast.	6.904807368821763

Tocopherol protects from heart disease , stroke , Alzheimer 's disease and cancer.	7.129638033030939

The immune capacity also increases with tocopherol.	7.414400335940802

Trocotreinol fights against heart disease , breast cancer , it also protects the skin from ultraviolet radiations.	5.290794612093936

Where is tocopherol found ? 	10.96860475239285

In less quantity tocopherol is found in almonds and vegetable oils.	6.800908926161273

Trocotreinol is found in the husk of rice.	9.609489375699896

For therapeutic dose the need for other complementary substances arises.	6.48426194103303

The dose of natural Vitamin E has been suggested in the form of 400 to 800 I.U.Of mixed tocopherol.	5.05039874116303

What does selenium do ? 	11.861166620992831

Selenium protects from cancer , heart disease , cataract , muscular degeneration and is supportive in the function of other antioxidant.	4.390304717075749

Where is selenium found ? 	10.94011054987251

Selenium is found in brazil nut , cereal , vegetables and its quantity various according to the regional soil.	6.269915198335449

In the suggested dose 100 to 200 mcg of selenium with food or even without food daily.	3.741220731628956

Do not take selenium in large quantity otherwise poisoning may occur.	5.279153364861353

Start taking antioxidants after the age of forty years.	5.5206180695112295

If before the age of 40 years you have to take many pills then you should not take coenzyme Q - 10 alpha lpoic acid.	5.742967869284461

Coenzyme Q - 10 fights against cancer and heart disease.	6.0775258010995135

Coenzyme Q - 10 makes the gums strong , protects nerves , is helpful in energy production.	5.702908251840221

Where is coenzyme Q - 10 is found ? 	7.056154022016928

Coenzyme Q - 10 is present in each tissue of body , specially in heart.	5.907836117085744

Coenzyme Q - 10 is also found in almonds and oils but for medicinal dose extra quantity may be needed to be consumed.	4.029740443332341

In the suggested dose with daily food 30 mg of coenzyme Q - 10 specially , is important for heart patients.	4.0004131660407225

What does alpha lipoic acid does ? 	7.581220666109298

Alpha lipoic acid protects from the nerve damage related to heart disease , cancer , cataract , stroke , diabetes.	4.563871884747756

Alpha lipoic acid increases the level of glutathione.	8.325012349935676

RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VAUX V_VM PR_PRQ N_NN N_NN N_NN 	3.02557525329053

In some food substances very little quantity of alpha lipoic acid is found example lettuce , meat , potato etc.	4.111813597839546

In the suggested dose 100 mg quantity of alpha lipoic acid with food , 200 mg everyday can be taken by people suffering with diabetes.	3.649322389259905

What is the sufficient quantity of nutritive substances ? 	6.48066581208084

In 1941 American Food and Nutrition Board decided the quantity of various types of nutritive substances after guessing the quantity of nutritive substances , the protection of body through nutritive substances , through figures after studying the scientific history.	4.373185567072228

For each type of nutritive substance the board has decided recommended dietary allowance RDA which is 98 % diet for healthy people , which the body can easily accept.	4.125634449145592

Tolerable Upper Intake Level UL - is that quantity of nutritive substance which a healthy person can consume everyday without any harm.	4.519193000478815

Only in some cases the board could not decide yet that how much quantity of nutritive substance would be beneficial or harmful.	4.478980423825448

How to choose antioxidants for fighting the diseases.	5.9063280078697575

Whenever you buy fruits and vegetables , keep in mind that you choose only those whose color is bright.	5.212397112451582

As much bright the color of the fruits and vegetables that much more would be the antioxidants.	6.204244113280524

Apart from this there are more antioxidants in fresh fruits in comparison to canned , cultured or heated food materials.	5.26666517018524

Generally if you consume food materials with little variation then you get more antioxidants.	4.703345090014235

Like in comparison to green colored or white colored grapes antioxidants are found more in red grapes.	5.848711035800012

In comparison to white onion red and yellow onions are more antioxidant rich.	4.417671032208865

Every patient of dementia may have his own different symptoms.	6.341374743968733

If this disease is due to the reason of the disease named Alzheimer then the death of patient occurs between 1 to 20 years.	4.990664680035319

On the occurrence of this disease before 50 years its more serious form comes forward.	4.980836571847919

The ex president of America Ronald Reagan had also become the Vitim of this disease only.	5.836052533552587

Generally the meaning of hysteria is considered in the form of the onset of bots of unconsciousness.	5.405172351905594

But there are many types of hysteria.	10.056734040441986

Due to ignorance this myth is popular pervasively that this disease occurs due to the effect of various supernatural powers , ghost , spirits , souls of dead etc.	3.8283117284086527

the disease of hysteria is found in children from 5 years to even men.	9.171227568197336

The chance of the occurrence of the disease of hysteria is the maximum between the age of 10 up to 30 years.	5.107578975169592

RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VAUX N_NN PSP N_NN PSP N_NN N_NN PSP N_NN 	2.0539777410016367

Theatrical hysteria - in this the patient conducts as if in him there is the residing of any god , spirit or ghost and the powers of giving boon or punishment have come in him.	4.262826920673507

That time the voice of the patient also changes.	10.847437474190812

Big crowd of audience get surrounded near him and people ask for favors from him.	4.141712909310011

Paralysis - in this the condition of weakness appears in one or more organs like in hand , foot , shoulders etc.	5.727114657304832

Whose relation is not with any physical deformity or disease even.	6.974551580854883

At times there is such feeling as if the body organ has stopped working.	4.812997900366737

Many times for doctor also differentiating between actual paralysis and hysterical paralysis becomes difficult.	3.9547918619779625

Dumbness and noiselessness - in these conditions the patient is not able to speak anything.	6.1716634908554235

But without any problem he can whisper , can do his talking by writing or gesturing through hands.	4.393082685536904

On investigation all the organs of the patient of hysteria like the tongue , lips , sound cord etc are found to be working in normal way.	5.292299712129286

Why does hysteria arise ? 	11.011642731483901

The mind complicated by some problem when fails to find any solution then the situation of a mental conflict arises.	4.55897950787813

In such situation if any person is not able to face his mental strife or is not able to express his problem in any way then the suffering mind finds the way to escape from his problems or to express them through hysteria.	4.193312448590939

Often women due to social and domestic situations are not able to express their desires and feelings and consequently many types of internal conflict arise in their mind.	4.137980982388351

These conflicts continuing in the sub - conscious mind become the reason of hysteria.	6.156642482697332

Hysteria is completely the game of sub - conscious mind.	6.08679240108409

The addiction of intoxication is also the disease of mind.	8.90836444813889

The biggest problem is this that those people who do intoxication they themselves do not know whether they are the victim of addiction or not.	4.874235578908822

One person who takes eight - ten pegs of alcohol only four or five times in a month he assumes that the addiction of alcohol has occurred to him.	4.094719083601132

On the other hand that person who takes half bottle of alcohol every night and can not sleep without drinking , says to himself that no - no I am not drunkard , drunkards are of different kind altogether.	3.3869956821321057

I drink only some , that also while sleeping.	6.4014731285111806

The person does the intoxication of anything and to him any of the three things out of six things given underneath apply to him then assume that he has been addicted or used to for intoxication.	3.9299317060577814

Intense desire to take intoxicating substance.	9.821843201012808

Repeatedly failing in the attempts to quit intoxication.	6.579379333817275

Arising of physical and mental problems on the unavailability of intoxication like the shivering of limbs on not getting alcohol , not getting sleep or getting restless.	4.158278303603736

Gradual increase in the quantity of intoxication because after some time the effect of the previous quantity starts reducing.	6.870752695799261

For example the person doing smack intoxication in some months from half gram smack his coming to two gram smack.	3.847676817068601

Wasting a lot of time in the consumption of intoxicating substances.	9.568175063328152

The person ignoring the other aspects of his life like socializing , doing his work , care of the children etc.	4.9916082372217945

Intoxication is harming the body , despite knowing this continuing intoxication.	5.596520500775753

For example despite jaundice and vomiting blood not stopping the consumption of alcohol.	5.068074795602915

Apart from this other symptoms like intoxication in solitude , harm to the physical and mental health , taking intoxication in large quantity in one go etc are also the signals of the problem of intoxication.	4.8116822640199

The consumption of alcohol in India is continuously gaining strength.	6.096223493838151

If the drunkard is able to quit alcohol foursome months then it is good riddance , because during this his body and liver gain strength as earlier.	4.545480723261128

But if the liver has become absolutely bad then even after quitting alcohol it does not become alright.	4.337823702326354

For the patient it is very difficult to quit alcohol on his own is very difficult.	5.590509103292222

for this a lot of will power is needed which is formed in very few people.	6.990075478509001

Some people think that by gradually reducing the quantity of alcohol one day I will completely quit it in fact such people deceive themselves.	3.807135776006382

In order to get rid of this problem it is extremely important to take the advice of the psychiatrist.	4.426433505011649

To treat addiction two method are used one is through medicines and second through behavioural treatment.	4.6837828900062926

In the treatment through medicines some special medicines are started after completely stopping the alcohol of the patient.	4.172251655801907

After some days of this the patient and his family members are told about two different types of medicines.	4.535770419622016

One medicine helps in reducing the addiction of alcohol while the second medicine produces negative effect as the alcohol is consumed.	4.676799422480707

This method is determined after talking to the doctor.	5.947079362220084

Abstain from the quacks advertising the medicines for quitting alcohol without telling.	4.610394359538137

It is said that person devoid of literature , music and art is like animal.	4.007929607791576

This thing is right to some extent but if seen on behavioural level then the person who does not use this gift of laughter endowed to man by nature then he is the biggest animal.	4.161714650092256

Human body is like a laboratory in which every moment biochemical and electromagnetic changes continue taking place.	4.315278325308418

As a result of these various changes man gets the feeling of happiness and pain.	4.5794436418332305

Mind has deciding role in this.	7.2866545971539844

According to our psychological state the bio - chemical structure of our body is only affected.	4.6204286950257

Optimistic psychological state has positive and negative psychological state has negative impact on the bio - chemical structure of our body.	3.8400702774531728

The person laughing reaches to the state of no state that5 very moment which is the state of meditation only.	5.902151792174016

When you laugh then in those moments you reach to the state of deep thought or meditation on your own because at one time only laughing and meditation becomes impossible.	3.8080073270685095

The meaning of laughter is to produce obstruction in thought process.	5.3674881331342235

The diaphragm becomes strong and by this one gets help in the treatment of the diseases related to mouth , throat and lungs.	5.9149047339198635

By laughter the rate of blood flow becomes fast because of which the quantity of oxygen in the blood increases.	7.52464927393227

In this entire process glow comes on the face.	5.0773524579899405

The more one laughs and makes the other laugh that much more his face would glow.	4.524482678386539

The more the absorption of oxygen in the body that much more energy would be produced and as much energy is produced that much we will stay disease free.	4.22533975331224

The person who can not laugh for him the door of intellect is closed.	4.395477290809226

For me the importance of laughter is high.	8.880019907086625

Any religion has not thought of laughter ever.	7.003366608415048

Religion has always emphasized on seriousness and therefore all the world went on becoming sick psychologically.	4.579588424758926

Through laughter throw away the coat of negative point of view or seriousness forever.	4.662711420222047

Leave making excuses and smile a little.	6.427568893354678

After this laugh and laugh strongly.	6.962803454960675

Yawning is one such thing.	16.121607261231134

After this he made the volume of carbon dioxide zero percent and once more the rate of yawnings were seen.	3.532989877619269

It has been seen that both the times the rate of yawnings dimension has been nearly equal.	4.104488091375836

Do we take more yawnings when we are tired ? 	7.304028507928703

No difference has been seen in the dimension of yawnings before the exercise , during and afterwards.	5.209396963476938

Does yawning have any relation with age ? 	7.374545894472684

It has been found that new born baby and even the foetus yawn.	5.128814138627665

During ultrasound inspection yawnings have been recorded in twenty weeks pregnancy.	5.195427650955658

It seems that this action is approximately as important as respiration , movement of eyes and parturition during birth.	4.076967858478519

This is an involuntary action on which the person does not have any control.	5.518247756085046

Yawning is not a simple action.	14.267019668524451

On average yawning is of 6 to 7 seconds.	7.962644739378321

During yawning the air is inhaled till deep and then released all of a sudden.	4.021717453820835

During yawning the heartbeat rate increases up to 30 percent and many types of nervous scientific changes occur in the brain.	5.3554077448525135

It seems that the relation of yawning is to the attentiveness of waking up.	4.518449675949895

By this one understands as to why long spells of yawning comes to people suffering from nervous scientific problems epilepsy , multiple sclerosis.	4.0026056937523355

On the basis of the nature of the disease , the availability of the related medicine and its process of effect the doctor prescribes the patient to take pills , injection and syrup according to the need.	4.241672238342998

Maximum medicines are available in all the three forms of pills , syrup solution , injection.	6.628250694599616

Then also there are many such allopathic medicines which are available in one form only.	5.938939646519486

Keeping the condition of the patient , age , condition of the disease and the effect of the medicine in sight the medicine is made to reach the body through the following media.	6.0796282904196275

Through the mouth the medicine is given in the form of tablet pill , capsule , syrup solution.	5.715532825825638

The cover of capsule is made of gelatine which melts after going to the gall bladder.	5.120916017251441

With the name of medicines which are to be drunk you often read linctuses , mixture , emulsion.	5.475527562672367

From linctus the meaning is of that medicine which generally is in sweet solution.	5.663929965216594

Mixture is the solution of many medicines in water or in other chemicals.	7.209095781329406

In emulsion there are two solvents which generally becomes negligible.	6.304539843311591

The medicine of heart disease is placed on the tongue , which shows effect immediately by melting gradually.	5.367015988954404

This medium of taking the medicine is called ' sub lingual ' medium.	7.228390768384252

Injection and allopathic treatment have become the synonym of each other.	5.062457000795398

For giving glucose and other medicine fast into the body injection is given intravenous that is through the medium of arteries.	5.067145718962196

The veins visible on the outer part of the body take the deoxygenated blood towards the heart.	4.595167486244115

Opposite to this the arteries situated in the deeper parts of the body take the blood to the rest of the body from the heart.	6.262943430060931

In the arteries this blood flows with the speed of 65 kilometre per hour.	5.211849623904549

Then only the arteries are heard to be beating fast.	5.7154378102028875

In general terms it only is called ' pulse '.	6.971938451043213

the second popular medium of giving injection is ' intramuscular ' that is giving injection in the muscles.	5.04591239211519

Generally injection is put on the upper or outer part of the arm or the upper part of the hips only.	6.236295393760589

Actually in both these places the nerves beneath the flesh is less.	5.049506087205682

If any nerve gets damaged through the needle of the injection then it can be lethal for the patient.	4.698003086737349

Apart from these popular methods there are ' subcutaneous ' and ' intradermal ' methods as well.	4.051551900765726

In these methods instead of putting the injection deeply in the flesh it is put at low depth beneath the skin.	4.0047502436743905

The ' turbutaline ' injection in respiratory disease and ' insulin ' injection of diabetes is put through this method only.	5.535510131405255

In the subcutaneous method the effect of the medicine is slow.	6.486303683890287

Apart from this injection is also put in stomach peritoneal.In chect pectoral and spinal cord spinal.	4.068323721567549

In the diseases like asthma and cough the patient takes in some medicine by inhaling through breathing.	5.013799162946801

The medicine to make unconscious during surgery ether is also given through this medium alone.	4.936387651497562

In the medium of local application ointment , balm , oil etc are applied in body pain , warts , injury , itching atc on the essential places.	3.89902572773177

The ointment applied on the nose , ear and eyes and glycerine etc applied on mouth ulcers also come under this category alone.	4.7499182466562

How does the medicine show its effect ? 	6.013327278740686

The medicines given through the injection enter the blood flow directly only.	6.035545213609369

Therefore the effect also is quick and pervasive.	6.134119786352071

The medicines taken through mouth digest with the food in gall bladder and intestines.	5.463753076905433

The intestines fail to absorb these medicines completely.	6.2519493696735005

If they stomach is empty then the oral medicines show more effect.	5.137031380861945

The medicine absorbed through the intestines goes to the liver through the ' postal vessel '.	5.253732051688512

If the functioning of the liver is not alright then maximum medicines become inactive.	5.170364281154302

various types of enzymes affect the chemical activities of the medicines.	8.923890841194961

From the liver the medicine goes to the heart and from there through the pumping action it sends the blood to every cell of the body.	4.960364816035057

The medicine travels in the entire body through the plasma available in the blood.	7.262565963673771

These medicines finally mix with the fluid available outside the cell and show their effect wherever there is need of medicines.	4.068491561985594

After the consumption the remaining medicine is excreted through the urine after reaching the kidney from the heart through the medium of the excretory parts of the cells.	4.431688956110616

Therefore during the excretion of some medicines the color of the urine appears to be yellow , red or dark.	4.603134990295691

Which medicine stays in the body for how long and for how long it affects , on this basis alone the doctor prescribes the mode of taking the medicine to the patient.	4.343241786452123

Even after scholarly studies and researches the exact theory of the effect of the medicine has not been developed.	4.340621633586231

Receptor Theory ' proceeds by considering this that along with special tissues there is a construction named receptor in the body which attaches to and then speeds up as the medicine comes close to the tissue.	4.731177602125527

The second theory is of ' antimetaolitis ' , according to which the cells acquire their nutrition from special type of elements.	4.6585562756480225

The antibacterial medicines too possess the shape of nutritive elements.	6.590268906202434

As such the microbes etc consider these as nutrition and their growth stops.	4.376273273454728

Finally the microbes die and the patient become alright.	8.913898302446512

Some enzymes do the work of ferrying the liquid inside and outside of the cells.	5.243319061390423

Some medicines are capable of affecting the general nature of these enzymes and the functioning cells.	4.262685453461085

Allopathic medicines are made of various types of plants , minerals , chemicals and the body of animals.	7.636742426731943

These medicines show effect according to the nature of the specific disease.	6.535658905192101

Some medicines fulfil the deficiency of special elements in the body while some deactivate the chemicals which have increased.	5.4784695763589575

Similarly some medicines provide speed to the activities of the body while some finish off the growing microbes.	5.652141606865185

Due to this reason alone the side effects ill effects of English medicine is also very much.	5.008104856334139

As it is clear from the name alone , the attainment of the condition of sleep through yoga only is yoganidra.	4.124340236012604

What is yoga ? 	15.76493851164822

The control over the activities of will or mind alone is yoga.	6.2379975649700175

Handicappedness is an extremely ancient and omnipresenet problem.	9.400788421940172

The people of all the parts , religions and communities of the world get affected with handicappedness more or less.	5.298440757604964

Everyone male - female , rich - poor can be the victim of handicappedness.	6.733687466564338

With time change has come in the appearance of this problem of handicappedness.	7.6594048425348396

Today control has been achieved to very great extent on measles , reasons of blindness at birth , leprosy , polio etc.	4.475080892568456

The cases of cerebral palsy and mental retardation are increasing.	6.639254023199921

The spread of education in handicaps is also increasing and the understanding of people towards handicappedness is also becoming positive.	4.88230137337769

Technical development has provided artificial reading power to blind people , better hearing power to deaf people , improved movement to skeletally handicapped people.	3.6457096665265594

The development of medical science has prevented the growth of diseases and put reins on the process of conversion of diseases on handicappedness.	5.10271082729085

The spreading of education among handicapped people is increasing due to the efforts of Indian government , state governments and self help organizations.	4.966464194831683

Today the situation has come to this that by providing suitable environment and extra facilities the handicapped people can be included in the mainstream of society.	4.201189559507681

Now instead of becoming burden on the society the handicapped people may come in the condition of contributing to the society.	4.686008141373287

Computer , information technology , automation have made working for handicapped people very simple.	5.332057565793238

Now in comparison to normal people handicapped people may contribute better.	6.783336634484635

The weakening of any part of body , situation arising due to deformation is called handicappedness.	4.8532415882125735

The ability of sight plays important role in our life.	6.044843952780215

Most of our activities are possible because of our reason of seeing.	5.529220046353466

The various types of deformities occuring in eyes become the reason of vision imparement.	6.481821960486001

How much is the vision impairement this a specialist doctor can tell only after complete check up but there is also an easy method of testing it.	4.631594694693712

If a person is not able to count the fingers of a person standing at the distance of three metres then he can be considered visually impaired.	4.733916333951776

The complete investigation of visually impaired person is essential.	5.178341575770503

A big part of the eye ball is white.	8.864627689418713

This white part maintains the shape of the eye and also protects its fragile construction.	5.72186722796061

A small part exists in front of the eye which is called cornea and it works as a window.	5.928330579854442

Light enters through the medium of cornea.	10.483420630095107

Hearing impairment is that condition in which child or adult is incapable of hearing partially or in complete form.	4.814620638693213

There are many types of hearing impairment.	6.1910984070800605

Many times outer and middle ear fail to transmit sound to the inner ear.	4.0251972873887345

In such situation the person faces difficulty in hearing.	4.583572270578589

One more reason for this can be this that dirt gets accumulated in the canal of the ear.	5.2797763461834215

Apart from this deformity in the construction of the bones of the ear , injury or because of the reason of any disease also it can happen.	6.611075821739308

The reason of other type of deafness can be the deformity in the inner ear.	5.849143449575238

The more the deformity , more is the loss of hearing ability.	5.911943268134759

In the innere ear place is decided for every frequency.	5.1390350549142045

In the inner ear the loss at any frequency becomes less and on some it becomes extremely high.	5.088910695455192

There are many reasons of this type of deformity but generally due to the reason of damage of the minute construction of cochlea this deformity takes birth.	3.771453231679784

In some children due to the damage occuring in cochlea the ability to bear loud noise gets destroyed.	5.11247395015558

The more the damage becomes the ability of child to recognize words become that much less.	4.767527709428025

When the damage occurred in the cochlea it does not get corrected through treatment and surgery then there is no other way leaft apart from wearing the hearing aid.	4.398139733412878

If the pregnant woman suffers from from viral fever , influenza , chicken pox , mumps etc in the first trimester then the child in the womb can be adversely affected.	4.0954636538684674

The child in the womb can also become deaf.	6.98184662937883

The complications during birth like foreceps delivery can have influence on the ear.	4.610524004764033

Continuous flow of water and pus may also become the reason of becoming deaf.	7.337776368721748

If the pregnant woman eats unnecessary medicine without the consult of the doctor for abortion or any disease then there could be adverse effect on the foetus and it may also become deaf.	5.005809067619799

There are two ways of safety from deafness.	4.838385125592054

First way is this that one should stay away from those diseases which give birth to deafness.	7.005228022548852

Second this that if there has been the influence of this disease then it should be prevented from being converted to handicappedness.	6.445114177275108

The useful instrument used for hearing in deaf people is basically a small electronic appliance.	4.2428496386673

This electronic appliance is also called a minute mike.	8.674645816484965

Through this electronic appliance or minute mike the sound can be amplified many times.	4.127365406663418

Speaking is actually a special process which differentiates us from other organisms.	5.2587193236901975

If by 15 months the child is not able to speak meaningful word then it is essential to get him tested.	5.336891352251961

If by this age the child starts speaking words like mummie , papa then there is no reason to worry.	5.718680033448581

If the voice of the child is abnormal , heavier , or comes with obstruction then also it is essential to get it c hecked up.	4.838637518497346

During management program the exercises for the growth of child is being done.	6.471092275029362

During management plan the activities of daily life are taught.	5.38262414605423

The child is taught to speak , move etc under the management plan.	4.29781947309136

Under this the difficulties of the children are solved and the treatment of the diseases are also done.	5.735624234668382

Some activities among these take place in hospital or rehabilitation center and some take place at home alone.	5.21065908922573

The activities which take place at home are demonstrated to the mother - father and important instructions are given to be repeated at home.	4.7317802179331006

According to the American Association of Mental Retardation that person is called mentally retarded who is not able to do his simple activity.	4.395479064139319

The measurement of intelligence is less than 70 and bothe these problems start affecting the person from the age of 18 years only.	5.095717139120484

From 0 - 6 years the child learns to stand up , walk , run , eat , wear clothes , use toilet , keep clean , to converse etc.	3.705485999297734

From 6 years to 12 years of age the child learns to read - write , talk meaningfully , to help etc.	4.662764321897198

From 12 to 18 years of agethe child learns to do all his domestic work and lears to use hospital , post - office , public vehicle , phone etc.	3.627184750570913

The child acquires skill in sports and entertaining activities as well.	4.134075415952881

the child learns to do useful work as well.	5.346987875016327

That child whose growth rate is less than the above mentioned rate he is considered to be mentally retarded.	5.636402022211068

Intelligence measurement scale is a method to measure intelligence prepared by the scientists.	6.425231372480797

The average IQ of man is from 90 to 110.	7.964488680056043

If the IQ is between 70 to 89 then the man can lead satisfactory life.	3.101618492418622

On the IQ being less than 70 it becomes essential to pay attention to him.	5.371845320136236

If the IQ is between 52 to 69 then the man is considered to be less mentally retarded.	3.6828166481611713

The man with IQ between 36 to 51 is considered to be average mentally retarded.	5.216353682699666

If the IQ is between 20 to 35 then he is considered to be extremely mentally retarded.	3.897659886486829

The people with IQ less than 19 are considered to be extremely serious.	6.347686226734275

Making a mentally retarded child recognize himself and learn his own name is an art in itself.	4.0183576976297495

For this during all the activities of the menatlly retarded child like bathing , changing clothes , eating , playing etc.his name should be called.	3.571888178891908

Apart from this after showing the reflection of the child in mirror his name should be called out so that he can recognize himself.	4.263942712129932

For making the mentally retarded child learn to drink milk at first he is made to sit in front of the mirror and shown to hold the glass.	3.8800488204852743

The child becomes happy by seeing himself in the mirror drinking milk.	4.923467365294393

Initially the child has to be given support but later on the child the child starts drinking on his own.	5.76048064843694

People who are mentally ill are entirely different from mentally retartded people.	4.205694043570224

The IQ of the person mentally ill is average or more than average.	5.990686679925165

The growth of the person mentally ill also takes place normally.	7.270997589435272

These people are victims of the psychological disorder and become alright through medicine or psychological treatment.	4.892082330470986

Due to psychological disorder their feelings become deformed and along with it effect is seen on the intelligence as well.	4.456767130377227

The persons mentally ill generally become alright after treatment and lead normal life at home.	4.704074964972541

If the hands of the person are incapable then he would considered to be the victim of the impairement of the upper skeleton.	4.655064062183777

If the legs are incapable then he would be considered to be the victim of impairement of lower skeletan.	4.066423391098545

There are many reasons of skeletal impairment and some among these start from pregnancy itself.	3.590521102403622

Many diseases occurring to the pregnant mother become the cause of handicapedness in the child in the womb.	5.278224783976408

Many times from the time of birth the hands or feet of the child remain underdeveloped or are not there at all.	5.462433260481514

In such situation the person does maximum work with the help of assisting instruments or artificial organs.	4.638076056290186

Many times the loss of hands can be fulfilled with legs and the loss of legs with hands.	5.186558083297017

The legs of many children are twisted and deformed from birth.	6.253696908975702

Attempt should be made to straighten such deformed feet as soon as possible because the bones and joints of children are soft.	5.456723445999435

Cerebral palsy is one of the deformities occurring from birth and is sufficiently dangerous.	5.86289993556706

Due to the damage occurring in the brain some organs of the brain stop functioning.	7.271764300287463

Jaundice is a major reason of cerebral palsy.	5.899491621503971

In the state of jaundice one can be saved from this situation by giving blood to the child as soon as possible.	5.0292634371366125

High fever , vommitting etc occurring in new born baby become the causes of cerebral palsy.	4.842767671136154

Apart from this many children become victims of T.B.	5.916762803246026

The condition of cerebral palsy persists life long because there is no treatment for this.	5.4652303544565655

But on the other side if correct opportunities are provided to the suffering child then to sufficient extent he can become responsible and a man of independent personality.	4.059472505362027

In the management of child suffering with cerebral palsy the role of parents and guardian is important.	4.208202725696498

Therefore for preparing parents for this work continuous consult and support should be given.	4.546812584304238

The guardians must be shown the way to recognize specialities of the child and to help and support them in order to fulfil their deficiencies.	5.365739965287506

There is also the need of special instruments to the child suffering with cerebral palsy.	5.6782408721561515

With these instruments the children suffering with cerebral palsy are able to do many types of work easily.	5.82818053476151

Muscular dystrophy is one such disease in which the muscles continue becoming weak gradually.	5.214899968933904

Muscular dystrophyis of three types.	8.900293541396323

In the first type of the disease of muscular dystrophy the growth of the child occurs at first normally or a little gradually.	4.988984025067251

When the child is of 2 - 3 years then he faces difficulty in walking , strolling , running , climbing etc.	5.693129066342083

Later on in muscular dystrophy difficulty comes in standing as well.	4.8049368094624

After some days the child is forced to stay lying on the bed.	5.841369041810111

In the other types the rate of the muscular dystrophy disease is less or more.	4.7875446298524365

T.B.is of many types , bones and joints also become its victim.	6.392408541977673

Due to the reason of T.B.the rotation of the joints stops.	5.330269533410209

If T.B.reaches to the spinal cord then hunch comes out and paralysis may attack.	5.455646419652171

The disease of lathyrism is a disease that occurs due to excessive use of grasspea.	5.785359717567369

Grasspea is cheap and is eaten by the poor class in the large area of Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Orissa.	4.3402217664163345

Due to the use of grasspea first the person feels weakness in walking and then becomes obligated to take the prop of a stick.	4.719632808786906

During to handicappedness there is much more psychological damage than the physical damage.	5.976900653139666

In fact with the information of handicappedness a very big shock is received to the person.	5.2215586072433515

If we see from the scientific point of view then all the parts of our body work independently.	5.045698982811702

The effect of a bad or inactive organ is not seen on the other healthy organs.	5.667598524401222

There are very few such diseases which show effect on other organs together.	5.292961333514204

Therefore it may be believed that the reproductive organs of the handicapped person would be normal.	5.081475071077596

He can keep his partner happy by using his reproductive power and can fulfil family duties.	4.4324965121958515

During pregnancy the women with damaged spinal cord may have to face various types of complications.	5.595138538688549

These complications are untimely pain , ulcer due to pressure etc.	5.3958309478978865

Because of the spinal cord being damaged these women fail to feel the movement of the foetus.	5.081701739533509

The delivery in such women is possible through foreceps and other other methods.	6.469141877367028

There is no difficulty to deaf and dumb in walking.	4.903197185724053

Menatlly retarded or people suffering from psychological disorders also walk easily.	6.905078698276365

There is need of training for walking to blind people and skeletally handicapped people.	3.885009755240724

In new blind people there is huge lack of confidence.	5.936504044313407

Newly blinds become anxious on slight problem and in anxiety fail to even go for little approximation.	4.510169236449035

Therefore for such blind people the training of movement is that much essential as the learning of braille.	4.3573369308773815

Blind person can recognize objects to very great extent with touch.	5.251513529392068

Blind person can estimate by touching by using hands or feet.	4.234600079078746

Blind person can estimate many things by smelling inside or outside the home.	4.327171864391688

On the basis of smell the blind person estimates many shops , factories or offices.	3.9497990644571606

When we walk then the effect of the forthcoming obstacles is seen on our muscles and joints.	5.278179437115012

Different types of places grassy , road , sandy area or an area filled with mud puts different types of effects on the muscles and joints of our feet.	3.7835947886594603

Similarly while traveling in bus , climbing up the stairs or while opening the doors our muscles feel differently.	4.077070044520011

On the basis of these fellings the blind can come to know of his situation and direction.	3.890713446232413

The person with sight should stand in front of the blind person.	5.862916701751106

The blind person should hold the arm of the blind person by standing one step back.	4.774246560982147

The skeletally challenged person also is made to learn movement.	7.52808659704461

After the sudden skeletal handicappedness where its physical capacity decreases , there its confidence also shatters.	3.9734360706261103

In such while the skeletally challenged person is need of assisting instruments to move , there he also needs someone to give the right directions.	4.131181861237

Stick is the oldest assisting instrument in which there is the use of straight wood.	8.50544365973527

On the upper part of the stick there is one handle.	7.238359601028333

At present there is also the use of aluminium stick which is light and strong.	6.385383605776979

Below this aluminium tip there is rubber tip which keeps a good hold on the floor.	4.445947481555201

When wheels are attachd to the normal chair then it is called wheel chair.	6.2307641764078046

After sitting on this chair the victim of serious handicappedness also can come up to some distance.	5.1266483284671525

Motorised wheel chair for going inside and outside of house and office are also available which have brakes as well.	4.330512428159342

At present the complaint of contamination in things for eating and drinking are becoming common.	5.211158998022551

Ghee , oil , milk , spices and in fact in vegetables as well as the use of chemicals is a serious problem.	5.607490078236388

Certainly by consuming contaminated things we are straight away inviting diseases.	5.332205449812109

The chemicals mixed in these contaminated things affect our immune system directly , by which the problems of dehydration , vomiting etc may occur.	4.81799771421782

This way by the use of substances mixed with these chemicals there is a risk of the occurrence of the diseases connected to nervous system etc.	5.346146921495357

With contaminated things not just liver , but the effect is also seen on intestines.	6.246098247808999

We can overcome this problem , provided we stay cautious.	5.541867159536588

In order to stay away from the ill effects of contaminated food materials we must at first try to buy goods of good quality.	3.4747426542293085

An alternative from being saved from contaminated food materials may be branded items , but many times complaints may arise even in them.	4.006316321466156

Therefore for you organic foods would be safe.	6.1799037391519285

The biggest benefit of organic food products is this that no type of chemical substances can be used in them.	5.41086566892238

On the other hand the complaint of the mixing of fruits and vegetables and the use of chemicals to ripen them is also coming forward regularly.	4.285756377571933

This may also prove harmful with respect to health.	6.420574557192368

As such from the point of view of safety you must eat the fruit after peeing them off.	4.226457082013566

Similar things you can do with vegetables as well.	6.788960644673357

Not just this , you wash fruits and vegetables many times before use , so that , more and more color on them gets washed.	4.214966838377925

Just nutritive food is not essential , but staying cautious is also essential so that the chemicals do not go inside with nutrition in the body.	5.191412153211975

The problem of handicappedness is ancient and the efforts of their diagnosis are also equally ancient.	4.135618447265042

The level of technical dvelopment has been having continuous influence on these efforts.	4.249924303212231

The National institute for the Visually Handicapped have developed various types of assisting instruments for various purposes.	4.146517542895325

For the handicapped persons the set of pictures helpful in the study of physics have also been developed.	4.487678014687342

With the help of all these assisting instruments related to education the blind person can read new and every type of subjects.	4.175542542426882

For general blind persons tools for threading a needle , for shorthand etc have also been developed.	3.7937678890775395

For the physical development and the entertainment of blind people many things of games have also been developed.	3.9486902689233436

For the blind people the ringing balls in cricket and football etc have been developed.	4.374887649622462

Tactile chess for sitting down and playing , cards of braille , pocket frame etc have been manufactured.	4.4823408555796345

For the locomotion of blind people the stick which is brought in use have also been developed.	4.3740313757019536

Although the braille script has been of support for the blind people from long time but with time improvements have come in this as well.	4.03329494037076

The person types normal words on the computer and simultaneously the attached machine continues taking out the print in braille.	3.9763416511379606

Now in less time newspaper , letters , magazines or books can be prepared.	4.989675137516811

Where such machines are being imported from foreign institutions there in India as well many organizations are doing research in this direction.	3.9746555212224925

Voice synthesizer has also become common now and has become available in less price.	5.575416065239524

Whatever is fed into the computer , the attached voice synthesizer reads it aloud.	4.112479894981123

Previously the blind people used to get scared with calculation and maths.	6.972425780771451

now after the invention of voice calculator not just the anxiety of the blind people has vanished , but now they can also work at the place of calculations.	4.749540094416853

At present in our country there is adequate arrangement of making artificial leg or calliper etc according to severed legs or weak legs.	3.7590584938199743

The leg is severed below the knee or above , the artficial leg can be fixed.	4.765770552065923

similarly to whatever extent of the leg is weak or distorted the callipers can be prepared and these are very helpful.	5.686002244970598

These callipers can be worn for many years easily.	6.593527749116158

In order to make club foot straight initially and or the making of special shoes according to them is also easy.	3.4138509957544465

When the person becomes handicapped after becoming victim of a disease or accident then his treatment is done in various ways.	4.944996518219593

Among these various types of surgical treatment , physical treatment , physiotherapy , occupational therapy etc are included.	4.233676903739335

At present to great extent benefit has been observed in various cases of polio , leprosy , accidents.	4.83038283002906

In the country there is a web of the centres of ALIMCO and Mahavir Handicapped Institute where every type of artificial organ and calliper etc are available.	4.062408769052057

Through the surgical treatment the effort of making the patients of cerebral palsy normal is ongoing.	5.776133065622624

Due to the development in medical science the lost eye sight is retieved once again and the diseases do make the person blind.	4.640556928270818

The biggest example of this is earler people in large numbers used to become blind due to cataract.	4.447667370110215

Now with simple surgery the treatment of cataract is done.	7.980224557124642

Through the intra occular lens the person continues to take benefit of the complete sight capacity.	3.940691471069802

At present with the surgery transparency is brought back.	6.334212029247881

In the schools through the regular treatments of children prevention is applied on the diseases of eyes and the increasing diseases are corrected.	5.055721618123131

In various cases when the person starts living his life after considering himself blind then with the surgery of cornea he starts seeing.	4.516043063442674

Organisations like Mahavir Vikalang Sahayata Samiti have provided artificial organs to people by visiting villages and investigating on large scale.	3.714269286519808

Similarly in such camps the surgery of cataract of the eyes of people has been done successfully.	6.425974890413172

One more solution of the diagnosis of the problem of handicappedness is this that so much facilities and concessions should be given to the handicapped people so that there could be sufficient compensation to the losses occurring due to physical disabilities.	4.646348302836874

According to the order issued by the Railway Ministry blind people , physically challenged , deaf - dumb and mentally retarded people would get 75 percent concession on the fares of first class , second class and sleeper class.	2.9809238586753595

Also in season ticket the handicapped people get 50 percent concession.	5.641611184318092

Leaving deaf - dumb the assistants traveling with all the other type of handicaps also get this much concession.	4.695426874122498

In air travel only Indian Airlines gives 50 percent concession to the blind people.	4.94339791628753

In order to give more and more employment to the handicapped people they are provided with 7 percent reservation in dealership.	3.9589951821440375

The handicapped people need assissting tools in order to carry out normal work.	5.9916006590115

Therefore poor handicaps should be given assistance to buy tools.	7.871568327342216

People with the monthly income of twelve hundred rupees get the aid equipments worth 3600 rupees.	3.7083580430032628

Volunteer intitutions are given aids to educate children afflicted with cerebral palsy and mentally undeveloped children and for preparation of teachers and other experts to rehabilitate them.	3.663221372438338

Besides this different aids programs are also run through district rehabilitation centres , regional rehabilitation centres.	3.8925976160893376

Trachoma disease gets spreading through the dirty hands , polluted towels etc..	5.228070250672569

Flies also play an important role in spreading trachoma disease.	5.711680167810801

Trachoma disease is more in those areas where poor people live and there is a plethora of dust.	6.191224255631056

The areas having a lack of water also have trachoma in plenty.	6.374745676559262

Open and dirty toilets , open sewers , twittering of the flies also increase the number of trachoma disease.	4.770843218832289

Due to the disease of trachoma the eyes also get reddened.	6.5397700626342266

In such situation it is essential to keep the eyes clean.	6.139690635875423

In their place eat missi roti made of thick grains and fulke.	4.963539667427674

In food take only one gravy vegetable.	6.451291945841331

The meaning of more gravy in food is excess fat.	5.3569814381022915

It is even said , little gravy is sufficient.	4.922734721727501

Choose one type of food.	10.843769914239147

To not complement bhel and kachori with chopsey and pork windalu with sambhar wada.	3.764714671119164

In food take wine or water instead of cola.	5.0923174763240135

Wine can complement with Indian food.	7.890353040512151

Cola can give rise to gas related problems.	8.946846324263245

Contaminated water or vapor rich water has ill effects on digestive system.	6.234238541183307

These days due to gas , bile and phlegm separately or by the combination of two or all the three several types of disease must be arising.	4.592933718160513

Therefore in monsoon season fire must be safeguarded cautiously.	5.280849344020696

Due to the subduction of fire there are lethal consequences on health.	4.297990383528321

Due to the deformation of fire the person suffers from many types of disease.	4.439718308375977

During rainy season one should abstain from the consumption of fire enhancing medicines , gas reducer and digestion enhancer medicines.	4.6767232401913015

One should drink mixing the juice of lentil etc., old barley , wheat , shali rice , shadras , mastu , black salt , pippali , pippalamool , chavya , chitrak and sonth.	3.340939444701111

In the medicine world among the various popular methods of treatment the place of natural treatment is important.	5.132560897824287

Our body is a self controlled active tool.	5.81889001703386

The God has made the arrangement of self defense , health safety inside our body itself.	4.711540193526264

That system in which there is method of staying free of disease by supporting nature , there are rules that only is called natural treatment.	4.52288637442238

When people feel restless and uncomfortable after becoming infested with indigestion , weakness and rot due to wrong life-style , incompatible and untimely food then to get rid of them they use various medicines , injections.	3.5034050099100216

Through these medicines , injections even more dirt gets accumulated in the body.	4.495137417385365

The disease is not eliminated by medicnes.	8.26128862884439

One symptom of the complication gets suppressed and becomes the reason of another disease.	5.997252751805842

The body tries for its own defense.	7.136845703539064

The nature tries comprehensively to remove the dirt present in the body.	4.913877160453826

Naturopathy helps in removing and throwing away this dirt from our body.	4.972691357379976

Naturopathy makes the person healthy , strong and full of glow.	6.5974394666746825

Fast , juice , fruits , balanced diet natural lifestyle are helpful in naturopathy.	6.469888132568742

With the method of air , sunlight - water , massage , exercise , pranayam any disease is destroyed from the root.	5.195541060388871

State clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried , fried , cooked at high temperature or roasted food.	1.8820249387725372

Like in the villages as pollution arises in the drains and streets of villages disease is produced due to them.	3.752276876274178

Likewise dirt is accumulated in the body.	7.634890589348567

This dirt of the body can not be excreted through the medium of toilet , urine sweat etc and starts percolating inside.	6.168794772152281

That dirt of the body is the root of all the diseases.	7.495555602721169

If your disease is not able to be rectified by any medicine then get a new life by adopting new natural treatment.	5.476016799439833

Health is natural and disease is unnatural.	8.359069446412663

When we follow the rules of body and life then the health is natural.	5.160372504578473

When we ignore the rules of body and life , overlook then the disease is unnatural.	5.330135719876093

The normal reaction of the normal situation of life force is health and abnormal reaction is disease.	4.8284494101815145

This condition of abnormal reaction is the reason of disease alone.	6.825309601420869

Therefore we can say that those symptoms because of which the situations of disease are produced they should be corrected.	5.635649657475609

No effort should be taken in order to suppress the symptoms through traditional contemporary method and medicines.	5.763098860828133

The excess pressure of traditional treatment stays on treatment.	6.1592654185479425

Traditional treatment method does not rely on the philosophy of staying free of disease.	4.587616175600237

We know that for the treatment of disease traditional treatment method has left no stone unturned in every possible research.	4.705818037016696

The treatment of disease depends on the basis as to in what form do we take our disease.	5.5614650210314

There is immense attack on the body in the form of medicine , injection etc.	5.983480644344131

By that action procedure the patient becomes disease free , this is the general belief among people.	5.978252622170068

On the basis of this wrong belief the use of all types of medicines are used on the diseases.	5.059295507398175

That is simple cough and cold or dangerous cancer disease.	6.324732880379642

The nature tries to maintain balance in the body.	4.942900723314674

In the human body health and disease are two separate self religions in the human body.	4.509715090021367

మానవ శరీరంలో ఆరోగ్యం మరియు రోగం రెండు భిన్నమైన స్వయంధర్మాలు.	12.177669728519989

But it definitely lays stress on the fact that by understanding the creative process of nature dependent rules certainly the people suffering with dangerous diseases can be helped.	3.9995077335212796

The fact is that at present the extent to which people have the knowledge of destructive forces that much less they have the knowledge about the process of life force.	5.0178101744504495

In the natural treatment the treatment is done of the patient and not of the disease.	7.626042928868661

On the occurrence of disease for the treatment of disease it is important to stick to the rules of health and essential to stay away from the habits which produce disease , matter and diet which produce the same.	4.589246538716063

By abiding by the rules of health only all types of diseases are cured.	5.539233490708784

By following the rules of health the treatment of the dangerous disease like cancer also is possible in the present times.	5.111669789105033

For the treatment of disease adopt any where and any type of method.	5.193697599884226

Eat medicines , but if you do not restricy yourself in food habits then the disease would not be corrected.	6.794492187699311

Someone consumes alcohol , is in the habit of smoking cigarette , bidi and his liver has become infectious , is suffering from rheumatism , arthritis , psyctic disease etc.	4.431440216319225

For these diseases the person eats different types of medicines.	6.7754213491222535

Natural treatment is also done.	8.67518869517624

But if they do not quit alcohol , cigarette , bidi etc then one can not get rid of the disease.	6.101780101666182

By spending money of lacs and crores one can not free oneself of disease , till the time one does not follow the rules of health.	4.444000662684179

Natural treatment is proud that the treatment of all types of diseases is possible in natural treatment.	5.501105510654011

If the person will get the treatment done and do not quit the habits leading to disease , then is its treatment possible ? 	4.775151474770789

This is also true that if the person gets the treatment done by staying in any natural hospital , where he is given diet and treatment under strict vigilence.	3.8017936434244914

The bad habits of the patient are removed with strictness.	10.524906961449883

In that duration of staying in hospital it is natural to get relief.	5.398675978051863

After coming back from the hospital again old habits , eating habits , and the rules of healthy life style are left , then again there is attack of the diseases.	4.749569352628924

The nature has given immense power to every living being to stay disease free.	4.2552672740638995

In order to rid us from diseases modern scientific development makes us aware of the behavioural and non destructive enriched energy of the nature.	3.773294055810261

If once you become complete by the nature and follow its rules then you would always appear healthy and full of lively youth.	4.232187190158454

What is balanced diet ? 	10.90753935873572

Form food the only aim of man is not just to fill stomach , gain health or fulfil taste , but also to bring about mind , character and spiritual growth.	4.299413035730128

The interest of man towards various types of foods is the symbol of his conduct and recognition.	5.114955051643908

Therefore in food the consumption of those types of foods should be done which is helpful in physical , mental , principle , social and spiritual enhancement.	5.289926232381915

Balanced diet develops love , affection , friendship , forgiveness , tenderness , non violence peace etc properties.	3.7045236145500744

Grow the feeling of respect and honor toward the humans.	6.772162208773022

Those foods in which there is no fulfillment of the above mentioned things and the consequences come the opposite instead , that food can not be called balanced.	5.385673738302785

What type is nutritive diet ? 	9.30538203692574

In the food the eleme  nts providing energy , strength and heat to the body like proteins , glucose , fat , minerals , vitamins etc should be present in proper ratio and sufficient quantity.	4.105506881164119

Due to which the growth of good cells in the body continues to take place.	7.031241708019806

According to one 's own financial ability , the selection of those substances may be done depending on the likeness and availabilty and personal necessity from the substances of various categories.	3.6916288185952983

Nutritive substances are also present in vegetarian food materials.	8.404813958821066

Today many doctors and people consider consuming nonvegetarian food for protein and calorie due to misleading advertisements.	4.04716531602061

But in many vegetarian food materials also protein , calorie , vitamins and nutritive substances are available in sufficient quantity.	4.2869111638703545

In nonvegetarian items the outer part of pulses , cereals etc there is no quantity of fiber present at all.	5.518701428402208

This has been ascertained by the scientists that fiber has a lot of importance in preventing diseases.	4.512077576714301

Vitamins are also essential for our health.	6.4963500165875665

The source of these vitamins are vegetable substances only.	6.387726962733524

The main source of food for animals and humans is the food obtained by agriculture or plants.	4.724770323254717

The proteins which are found in meat , those also are obtained from plants alone.	6.0769775816401

Therefore getting nutrition directly from vegetable substances is better than from that secondary nutrition which in animal meat has also been obtained from vegetable substances.	4.290703501271585

Some people spread this rumor that egg is a complete nutrition.	5.705624722098666

Vitamin - C , carbohydrates and fiber are not found at all in eggs.	6.175969699927953

Egg , meat , fish etc are acidic food due to which there is removal of calcium from the bones and due to this type of loss occurring of calcium it takes longer for the bone to rejoin after fracture.	4.539833437069319

There is also more cholesterol in eggs.	7.294077920030982

Any type of toxic substance can not arise in balanced diet prepared by mixing fruits , green vegetables , various types of lentils , seeds and milk.	4.518762412168385

Its main reason is that when an animal dies then it becomes dead substance.	5.044582993557338

This does not apply to vegetables.	7.921390050965036

If any vegetable is cut even half and its half part is put inside the ground then it will grow again in the form of vegetable or tree.	4.694287879544843

This is possible only because vegetable is a living substance.	5.301785189722756

This thing can not be said for a lamb , goat or chicken.	6.1849482482926925

From the other special sources it has been found this that when an animal is killed then it becomes afraid and the toxic substance released due to fear sprears in his body.	3.821287032815146

That same toxic substance reaches the body of those people in the form of meat who eat them.	7.026662487769694

Our body is not completely capable of excreting all those toxic substances.	5.154440068499248

The acid base balance is essential in food.	6.984610097872838

Many doctors believe that the reason of disease in body is the imbalance of acid-base.	5.404842142688365

But in our food attention is not paid on the ratio of acid - base.	4.904644590156991

But in the present times due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the consumption of cereals and vegetables without washing them properly and with peels may also become the reason of harm because of some part of poison remaining in them.	4.583264289862673

The aim of saying is this only that instead of giving importance to one sided thought with respect to food , we should take decision after thinking on every side with multiple point of view as per the weather and physical needs.	3.9652392098270877

But in no case the natural doctrines of Nature should be ignored.	4.6375190501297245

According to Chinese Panch Tatva doctrines various tastes have relations with different organs of the body.	3.603657656431189

Natural doctors have such beliefs that liver and pancreas are affected by sour taste.	5.095513259677618

Hot taste has relation with lungs and large intestine.	5.90381841469201

Sweet taste has direct relation with spleen and gall bladder.	5.063036643681873

The heart and small intestines etc are affected by bitter taste.	5.5715615007449575

With these tastes not just our organs get affected but the nutrition of these organs also take place.	4.519578652084805

The doctors consider the balance of taste in foood alone as the base of health.	5.01190315892762

The doctors treat by balancing various tastes.	6.545046193523209

The food should be according to the weather.	5.233006472636829

Those food materials which are obtained maximum from the nature in that month , is generally considered to be good from the point of view of health.	4.193615256522384

Maximum birds - animals which do not accumulate food and lead a carefree life lead there life on the basis of available fruits , leaves alone.	4.228552977992662

The nature gives complete support in order to keep each person healthy.	5.675141052052404

All the animals eat only those things , which is available around them.	5.676642397532896

Animals do not import food materials from other places.	6.848867282895601

The laws of nature are equal for every one poor and rich.	5.503428493462343

Therefore the consumption of expensive , unseasonal , imported food material is always useful for health , is completely false.	4.556933908830577

Balanced diet itself does the work of medicine.	7.233302778536996

Such is the belief of dieticians that the relation of maximum physical diseases is due to food related ill habits , carelessness and inattentiveness.	4.127809315830674

The chief reason of this is our ignorance about right food , greed for taste , lack of timely thoughtfullness , lack of prudence , immoral conduct , selfish point of view etc.	3.5576369221426862

In various medical methods attentiveness towards diet is an important part of treatment.	5.09823365359539

In natural treatment diet only is given the maximum importance for health and treatment.	7.011288628503358

According to the point of view of natural doctors and dieticians food alone is the medicine.	3.8903087331177733

What are you drinking in the name of tea ? 	6.938011417654883

What are you making your guests drink , if they come to know of it even slightly then people will run away from having tea at house.	3.608150086395811

You say that whatever tea I drink , that tea only is given to others , make the guests drink , and not giving any poison.	4.417402201233919

Actually in the name of tea you yourself are consuming poison , and making the others also drink tea.	4.528061463509744

You do not know that dishonest businessmen have mixed wood dust , sand , gravel and even the used tea leaves in the tea after coloring again.	3.7714029199474104

My blood has iron deficiency or I have anemia ?.	6.045270310789727

All the blood donors are tested for anemia and the blood of the blood donors with less than 12.5 % hemoglobin is not taken.	5.394094433048027

You do n't need any kind of rest or extra meal after blood donation.	5.752736284532202

You can go to work immediately after blood donation.	4.976446916393131

No difference comes in your daily life because of the blood donation.	9.2766124128864

I have a lack of time and it does not seem convenient to me.	5.928812802053331

The whole process of blood donation takes only hallf an hour while blood donation itself completes only in five minutes.	3.9580562462401288

It is compulsory to carry out the tests for HIV , Hepatitis-B and C , Malaria and VDRL before blood donation.	3.972691073813544

Learn the difference between cholestrol and fat.	8.492119960210797

Fat can alone increase your weight but cholestrol alone can not increae your weight.	4.6294171028872055

In 9 out of 10 people the reason behind obesity is the presence of both the fat and the cholestrol.	6.825058778961744

When the cholestrol is in the body in normal quantity then it plays an important role in keeping the artries of the heart healthy.	5.723134946305773

It is very important for health that the cholestrol be in normal quantity.	5.080985298711701

It is produced in the liver of our body by the nature.	8.98710577915494

If there is too much cholestrol in the body then it leads to the disease ` Aeksklerosis '.	6.225373849176271

In the ` Aeksklerosis ' disease , a wax-like substance is secreted in the artries which makes them very narrow.	4.341532053785164

Due to this wax-like substance blood is not able to flow properly which leads to heart attack.	4.743548554640866

HDL cholestrol is a high density lipoprotein.	9.241861608455835

Its job is to clear the way of the blood flow such that the work of the heart mechanism goes on smoothly.	6.654064973258302

We can call HDL cholestrol the good cholestrol.	5.4245489868498105

LDL cholestrol is a low density lipoprotein.	7.685545628175808

LDL cholestrol accumulates in the artries by combining with the fat which causes obstacle in the flow of the blood.	5.295743146061752

Due to the obstacle in the blood flow , there is a danger of heart disease.	5.97973672977491

We can call LDL cholestrol the bad cholestrol.	5.763603962549143

Vegetable fat is unsaturated lipid.	8.911632075256527

Because of vegetable ghee and the process of organic hydrogenation , vegetable oil takes the solid form in the room temperature.	4.904511744764702

Vegetable fat is not so harmful as saturated fat.	6.617692909711377

As far as obesity is concerned both kinds of fat increases obesity.	5.0010342318886245

Animal fat the fat found in all kinds of meat and milk products comes under this category.	5.319709999163918

Animal fat is saturated fat , which means that it becomes solid from liquid at room temperature.It increases the fat cells of our body which leads to increase in the weight.	4.584557410224747

Animal fat , along with the bad cholestrol , reduces the blood flow towards the mind and the heart.	6.776086553223209

If you want to remain healthy then before having your food first see how much is the quantity of the cholestrol and the fat.	4.425944799403238

Endocrine glands have a very important place in our body.	6.543775854043054

When endocrine glands secrete in enough quantity then our helath remains perfect but in case of the opposite our health malfunctions hence it is compulsory for us to keep them healthy under any condition.	4.196958275450651

Because of these endocrine glands someone is found to be extremely small , some tall , some fat and some absolutely thin.	4.349876590614344

Eunuchs are also the result of the abnormality of these endocrine glands.	6.3019812529803865

Sometimes you would have seen hairs on the face of the girls and boys without moustache and beards and would have heard of sex change all this is the result of the abnormality of the endocrine glands.	3.929984481639434

It is clear from all this that secretion of the endocrine glands keep a balance on our mental development , internal and external activities and behavior etc..	3.9319625048456692

The hormone secreting from the pancreat gland is insulin.	5.268702558683394

Pancreat gland keeps a control over the quantity of insulin.	8.716677097611464

When the body has excessive glucose then the secretion of insulin converts into glucose and due to the lack of insulin diabetes occurs.	4.619448577410022

Thyroid glands are of the shape of the shield and they are situated in the throat on the both sides of the trachea.	5.893954693422715

The hormone secreted from thyroid glands is called thyroxin and it controls the growth of the body and the rate of the heart beat.	5.489758918163637

It is helpful in proper usage of carbohydrate.	8.687357162397822

In case of deficiency of glucose in the body the secretion of thyroxin helps in the formation of glucose by separating carbohydarte from other substances and controls the quantity of calcium.	5.211987175917107

In case of throxin becoming over-active phosphate along with calcium is lost from the bone and it begins to come in excretion and consequently the bones become thin and weak.	3.6641614730222027

Parathroids are four in number and they are situated attached to the throid glands.	5.944114078045981

The hormone secrted in it helps in keeping the optimum quantity of calcium and phosphate in the blood.	5.148568145279347

Its deficiency lead to tetanus , calcium deficiency and increase in phosphorous.	5.932742157720305

The secretion of liver and stomach removes the deficiency of blood.	4.7160527524035585

The secretion of liver and stomach increases the red blood cells in the blood.	5.514108855201298

Adrenal gland is also called suprarenal gland it is near the kidneys.	7.4286244297770745

Every gland has two parts.	11.773806662732563

The outer part is called adrenal cortex and the inner part is called adrenal almedula.	4.4068049376441865

The secretion of the outer part of the bordering kidney has a great importance.	5.821646221209869

The removal of outer part by operation causes immediate death.	5.487369449930295

The outer part is essential for life.	7.26254022296794

The sexual feelings are balanced by these hormones.	7.555134663065982

Due to more secretion than required untimely sexual development takes place.	4.640595748726057

For example periods and complete development of sexual organs in 2-4 years old girls.	4.952513402167711

Testes in the males and ovaries in the females are present in the form of sexual glands.	6.9862894153484305

We call the juice secreted by these sex glands the sex hormone and it is this which gives maleness to the males and femaleness to the females.	4.256962145303596

Pituitary gland is the part of the brain itself and it is very small in size.	6.952576321766309

Several types of hormones are produced by the pituitary gland.	6.103263551578808

It is because of these hormones that the hormones secreted by the rest of the glands is produced in the right qunatity and their work is completely controlled.	5.13201697743263

It is very necessary for the normal development.	7.1372284780734265

These hormones are very helpful in removing the dwarfism.	7.419257520680672

The elements that develops then is produced in the front part of the pituitary gland.	6.566631880323331

The secretion of these glands is chemical and their work is also to produce chemical effect.	4.287105526759853

Taking bath in cold water leads to the formation and the secretion of hormones within the body on time and in proper form.	6.166936431905085

Use of fresh pure cold water is helpful in their secretion.	6.791797118516458

Therefore in order to improve the chemical work of these glands , we should take the complete chemical elements obtained by unripe food whether you take it in the form of water by taking the juice or just the unripe food in itself.	4.204918792595017

Because of the use of cold water the glands secrete properly by becoming strong and fired up.	4.66170363027379

The property of unripe food is also cold and that of acidic ripe potato hot.	5.2515789551229535

Therefore unripe food is necessary for the proper development and secretion of these glands.	6.215921629978237

Sufficient secretion by Pineal gland leads to proper secretion and development of sexual glands and it is also helpful in the mental development.	5.337290111017053

Because of the proper secretion of thymous gland , sexual maturity comes on time.	4.185944179252668

It is necessary to know about the deficiency signs of the endocrine glands so that the related glands could be fired up.	4.0956169514007135

When absorption and release process of carbohydrate could not take place completely due to the deficiency of insulin then diabetes occurs.	4.912988883487938

In case of deficiency of thyroxin , along with obesity and goitre , the absorption of iron could not take place sufficently.	4.056276775424348

In case of deficiency of secretion by the sexual gland , there is a lack of maleness and femaleness.	4.36346897562747

In case of deficiency of secretion by pituitary gland , alongwith dwarfism , strength also diminishes and complete inaction could even lead to death.	2.5646855772266615

In case of deficiency of secretion by pineal gland , there is an untimely development of sexual maturity and there is an improper mental development.	4.479537730099361

In case of deficiency of secretion by thymous gland the development of sexual organs is not proper and complete.	3.946718928735601

In case of deficiency of secretion by the adrenal gland , the life force diminishes and in complete inaction could even lead to death.	2.867989566127969

In this way the proper understanding of the indications caused by the deficiency of secretion is very helpful in removing the deficiency.	4.670870256722435

Cytica is a disease of nerves.	15.409707792479617

In the inner portion of the body , cytica nerve is a long nerve in comparison to the others.	6.494555697536721

Coming out of the lower end of the spine , it has gone towards the leg from behind the ankles.	6.731085876318233

The pain which it causes is called cytica.	6.163646091998022

This pain originates at the back and sometimes spread till the toe of the leg.	5.176533956099182

But generally the pain is caused by the part of this very nerve.	8.485655886297495

It is always limited at the back side.	6.165085504384283

The pain of cytica is very painful and it can be compared to the pain of the toothache.	5.508411612981751

This disease generally remains from several weeks to several months and in difficult circumstamces it can carry on till several years.	3.7590207074110116

Cytica occurs due to cold , residence in damp place , paralysis of the muscles and constipation etc..	6.55993875392737

When due to these reasons the blood flow becomes poisonous and the cytica nerve becomes agitated by this poison and swelling appears in it then this disease appears.	4.4683417316953316

Therefore in many areas cytica is called a kind of neuritis.	6.824438690794472

Sometimes as a result of an injury to the lower portion of the spine the cytic nerve is affected causing this disease.	5.335250870048577

It is said that this condition arises by standing or walking for a long time , bending suddendly , picking up heavy weight etc..	3.9829611086504197

In cytica disease it is extremely important to make the patient healthy along with the local treatment.	5.7797741523633315

For this it is specially important to pay attention towards the methodology.	5.505580240097591

But now because of the emergence of different diseases and allergies by the use of artificial resources , people have begun to give importance to the natural alternative.	3.763958083741219

It is necessary to give special attention towards the formation of acid-accumulation in the patient 's body.	4.422861507460171

In many situations this disease appears bcause of the decrease in acid.	5.580440319362174

If one can fast one day before the treatment then the patient is sufficiently benefitted.	6.069386806608511

In all the old diseases one should fast in some form.	5.435492877942904

The body gets cleansed by fasting.	6.550867703947796

Other dietary methods are similar to mental weakness.	7.578903570156252

How natural are the beauty products ?.	10.225276127092947

Nature is not just the beauty source but also a big source of beauty products.	5.813816688797204

We get such natural things from it which increases the beauty of our skin and hair as well as eliminates their diseases.	4.8751556857059715

Our body has the wonderful capacity to absorb the beneficial effects of these herbs.	4.827012084511752

Their speciality is that they do n't have any negative or harmful effects on the body.	5.091074705766566

India 's famous and internationally recognized beauty specialist Shahnaz Hussain believes that ` Ako prepared by the vegetation and herbs has a very important place in the area of beauty industry.	3.9916461853623257

They along with keeping the skin clean also nourishes them.	5.6512941183406245

It increase the blood flow and brings glow to the skin.	6.655955497124551

It also makes the skin free of diseases.	5.898716723930659

Today beauty products made of artificial chemicals in the form of beauty materials is quite popular.	5.976352979091821

In the cities and towns artificial face cream , shampoo , remover , hair oil etc are used in abundance.	4.806550234480674

But due to the emergence of different diseases and allergies people have now begun to give importance to the natural alternative.	3.4129994690846006

A lot of beauty products are now being sold in the market in the name of ` natural '.	5.343961564511861

Are they really natural ?.	14.537252952165987

Generally this question is a mystery for the consumers.	5.596025487337658

If we take a look at the advertisements then it is so that in the name of ` natural ' and ` herbal ' mostly chemical products are being sold.	5.121259696784945

Generally instead of taking the ready made herbal or natural beauty products available in the market if we prepare it in the home in consultation with a qualified herbal specialist then it is better.	4.668145521569592

Although in the busy life this is definitely a little difficult for every woman or man yet it is the best.	4.222628631978504

Some dependable herbal beauty products could be used.	7.264940243965566

Among these products like Shazema , Shalife , Shasilk , Shaleshm , Shabright , Shaclean , Shamlo , Shataj , etc are quite popular.	3.4164828001915115

For hair specially Shaneem , Shacare , Shahair , Shahina , Shatone , Shamla etc are famous.	4.262553779702504

Even Shahnaz Hussain does not give guarantee about her products.	5.83745164413118

She says that the way there is a reaction on the skin by the use of artifical products , in the same way there could be a harmful reaction from the products made up of herbs.	5.648905716369581

But there is no reduction in the effectiveness of the products because of our dependence on the nature.	4.904187685789598

It is also good to forget.	8.659742476683066

In the lives of all of us there are many moments worth forgetting.	6.406936600484093

It would have happened with you that some name might have been there in your mind but that does not come to your tongue.	4.829332113483383

Sometime you forget after keeping the keys somewhere.	7.3090640668553855

It is believed by the zoologists that even behind this incomplete memory of the humans also there is a motive.	4.861569818093157

Some people are unwavering in their belief that if we want a permanent impression of knowledge then it is necessary that our memory be incomplete.	4.290557342458287

If we could remember everything at the conscious level then we would go crazy.	4.610622567882508

Everything would have gone awry by the memory of smaller events , therefore it is good that we remember only the important things.	4.889928825612628

Healthy mind exists in a healthy body.	7.30646703572967

If your age is more than forty years and exercise four or five times a week then surely you could beat in memory that person of your age who do n't exercise.	4.013546079627082

If you do n't exercise regularly then leave your laziness now.	4.406535236920219

The wonderful tonic for the mind is the exercise.	8.57241942544268

It improves the flow of blood to the brain.	8.268336445604268

Our memory increases automatically.	13.891146515786984

Solving crosswords , puzzles and playing games like chess and cards sharpens your memory.	4.389131242914418

These games benefit slowly and at micro level now it depends on you which game you like.	4.232772581152689

Write all the things to remember briefly on a piece of paper.	5.603059790083419

This way this information will go into your memory.	6.185165117657166

With this your mind becomes free to memorise other things.	4.849581919847769

The storage of your memory is limited.	8.301893184243081

Whatever happens is not completely independent from the other events.	8.356973925777677

Pay attention to these events.	9.608129583837362

Very easily the description of any particular event will begin to flash in the mind.	4.198646012407878

If the mind does not co-operate , even then such facts could be searched in any book of general knowledge.	3.7818436178730215

By combining the events sequentially in this way many times our mind begins to think in the right direction.	5.172844984333281

The creation of anger takes place in the destructive part of our mind.	5.3760525588076575

In today 's time a lot of our problems arise because of the anger.	6.2955793652261525

Have you ever thought what is the reason behind this excessive anger in life ?.	5.038097132251157

The reason behind anger is stress.	7.171832073077963

The power to understand the things and situations logically reduces.	6.2597214280046245

Some people whose nature is to always get angry they are called the people of Type A..	5.384616725199375

During anger our body produces a lot of adrenalin hormone and neurotransmittors.	6.921645881774969

Heart attack happens because of the anger.	9.275692665615702

It increases the blood pressure and the possibility of heart attack increases.	6.690945473481403

For many people the enemies are the other people.	7.010453036226026

Anger is your biggest enemy which is hiding inside you.	5.247480428825619

Control it before it controls you.	9.403274071728893

Anger is a normal process.	12.932460743423558

When the anger becomes destructive then it becomes the reason behind many problems.	6.87680456945335

Whether these problems are in your work , personal relationship or in your lifestyle.	5.523737805886127

The way invention of Ayurveda medicine happened in India the same way development of Unani medicine took place in Arab.	4.443195304143852

Sooner or later all people from any age group , sex and the elderly suffer from fever.	5.418183100024408

According to Unani physicians fever is not a disease but is a symptom of other diseases.	5.070035520946798

In fever temperature of patient ' s body increases.	7.613595081449324

Sweating occurs on increase of temperature and fever ends.	5.7344154531566325

According to Unani physicians by being victim to fever dirt of body comes out through sweat.	3.8778060966634142

If man does not get fever then all the dirt can give rise to more sicknesses staying inside the body.	5.095634083311038

Phlegmatic fever happens more to little children and the elderly.	7.3841766357117296

According to Unani medical experts if phlegmatic fever occurs inside the body due to some problem then we call it ' laska ' or ' aesthenic fever ' in allopathy.	4.356896368644401

According to Unani physicians phlegmatic fever occurs due to the violent outbreak of flu.	4.687534308405819

On getting a cold by roaming outside for long time in a cold environment in the winters phlegm in body starts getting infected.	4.707596949465237

Phlegmatic fever ends by anointing fever - nut seeds on forehead and hands and legs on grinding with water.	4.940003653651624

Taking 6 masha each of all things dry ginger , chilli , sacred fig , cobra saffron , kutki , indra jau grinding a bit , boiling in water make a decoction.	3.152944839028054

Then by drinking the decoction morning and evening on filtering phlegmatic fever ends.	4.927549025832463

Taking 1 tola indigenous parsley put in a clay pot filling it with water.	4.439820993248976

Getting up next day in the morning phlegmatic fever gets cleansed out by drinking from above on taking strained water julal mixing with 2 tola of sorbete banfasha.	4.265870053444539

On drinking morning and evening 3 masha safflower seeds , 5 masha fennel seeds , 9 pieces of raisins seedless , taking out molasses of raisins , 6 tola of arq makoy , taking 6 tola arq fennel seeds , mixing 4 tola of yeast , banfasha , warming up a little , phlegmatic fever gets destroyed.	3.3826460642667424

Bile stays accumulated in gall bladder of body and participates in the digestion of food.	5.55460647297892

Bile also destroys the harmful bacteria that cause harm to body.	5.8420454593596345

But if bile itself becomes infected meaning defected for a certain reason then produces various diseases in the body.	4.345348402377459

These negative waves sometimes pervade the environment around us.	4.916463462474878

Hospital , crematorium or graveyard are the principal places of the negative waves.	6.182263643175874

The protective shield also stops our positive waves from getting wasted.	4.578348632796607

This shield is also necessary for our daily life , especially in the places like office or work-place , market-place , crowded place , railway station , hotel etc.	4.033408106394572

The protective shiled is made by the violet color.	5.852456864999857

You imagine two boxes of rectangular shaped mirrors of violet color.	4.426840558632981

One small box in which you are completely enclosed and the other box in which the first box is enclosed.	5.9108214864435045

Generally questions about right food is being asked in the Reiki seminar.	5.2468666288557815

The question which is asked most prominently is Do non-vegetarian food and intoxication affects the natural flow of Reiki ?.	3.7038537322288785

There is no kind of condition with Reiki , but even we are here shedding light on the non-vegetarian food and intoxication.	3.5467858554189267

It is extremely important that you do n't keep any kind of guilt-feeling in your mind.	6.249299387573051

Because guilt-feeling comes in your mind only when you do n't want to do that work but you do.	5.557023056332118

Reiki is that energy which develops and establishes your harmony with the nature.	4.497453718271372

After the initiation of Reiki humans will himself be able to decide what is in his favor , what kind of food habits he has to keep.	4.650326013531744

Reiki is independent of the effects of views and your food habits but they have a explicit or implicit effect on yor health.	4.371422062723182

The effectiveness of Reiki is also affected.	5.5260371835609465

The effectiveness of Reiki depends on your health.	5.6755606458004895

In such a situation person will be able to use Reiki only for one 's own health , will not be able to help anyone else.	4.555607123678063

Because how can an ill body help someone else.	6.171532599153278

On the basis of life-energy there is no difference in the body of humans and animals.	6.273942232852086

The principal elements of life-energy are air , sun , water and earth.	5.557020613344697

This life-force is comletely balanced in the plants and trees.	5.077653021374678

This life-force could taken visibly in the form of food.	6.109621212416556

Plants , vegetables and cereals are the natural reserves of these forces.	6.344556550400325

This life-force reserve remains present in them for quite a long time , even after they are cooked.	4.695615427479221

This way when the person eats vegetables , etc , pulses and cereals then he takes in the visibly available life-force present in them.	3.6459587232318995

That is why it is living food.	4.945944156974298

Besides this when we are in a condition of fear , anxiety , conflict , prejudice then bio-chemical changes happen in our body which spreads in our body in the form of poison.	4.959123959528355

This poison affects our body with different kinds of diseases.	5.774743993437197

Similarly when a person kills an animal for food then at that time that animal is overpowered by fear and bio-chemical changes happen in his whole body very quickly.	3.5632715592863202

This poison in the form of chemical spreads in his whole body.	6.147567065285843

This chemical , because of fear , shock and pain is produced in larger quantity.	6.193299872018362

The person who eats this meat eats this poison as well and takes the negative force in the visible form along with.	3.696125322303207

This force in future slowly begins to show its negative impact on the body and the person becomes affected with many diseases.	5.92321532776544

The consciousness present in the plants is completely different from the consciousness found in the animals.	7.081947593742464

The life force which is necessary for the food of humans that humans get in visible form in vegetables , cereals and pulses.	4.604319492007399

Intoxication first of all affects the mind and inspires the emotions buried into the unconscious mind to come out.	4.432226641662215

The buried emotions could be also of love , could be also of hate.	4.829714215130786

The person begins to behave abnormally due to intoxication because he no longer has control over his mind.	3.7088045665080185

The person can even become violent because of intoxication.	5.581266621263148

Intoxication always ends in mental depression itself.	7.611718950599956

The effect of intoxication is always negative on the body.	5.3463800375990225

Slowly the important parts of body goes on becoming inoperable.	7.508997597915955

The main element of solar plexus is fire and liquor which itself is a fire element completely destroys the solar plexus.	3.7515567710812747

Along with heart chakra closes by shrivelling which in itself is a fearsome situation.	4.726665103530885

Whether intoxication is of liquor or some other intoxicant material , the result is of simialr kind.	5.263570678882365

Similarly the intoxication of cigarrette , biri is also of the same kind , whose consequences are not good.	4.787324596855432

Slowly solar plexus begins to shrivel which gives rise to many stomach related problems.	4.330310991233322

The smoke coming out of cigarrette slowly keeps on obstructing the aura.	5.427810221142695

Therefore for good health and being a good Reiki channel it is best to keep away from the intoxication.	5.179321737189357

The person should take oath to leave the intoxication which will be an indication of good will power.	4.375940493353073

Sugar , sweets , chocolate , bottled  packeted drinking material are prepared by different chemicals.	5.22889676663296

These edible materials prepared by different kinds of chemicals is dangerous for our health.	5.755299414941216

There is no nutrition in these edible materials at all.	4.9595530285978855

In the race for modernity the level of knowledge has come so low that people have made these products an inseparable part of their life.	3.932288115523501

Sugar is a kind of acid because it is prepared with the help of acid itself.	7.535043327395484

This acid produces many kinds of diseases in our body.	5.9266404422950805

Among which the principal ones are ulcer , arthritis , problems of kidney , skin disease , insomnia and disinterest towards the study of children etc.	4.365080064871815

Those people who have mental depression and epilepsy they should shun sugar and products made up of sugar.	4.377632389801955

There are twenty spoonful of sugar in one square of chocolate.	5.638398458840672

In the same way are the packaged food items , they also give only diseases to us.	4.4688688978317135

A kind of chemical MSG-Monosodium or aginomoto is mixed in the packaged food which has the capacity to keep the food for more days.	4.242546664639377

The packaged food gives invitation to many diseases.	5.782762500304815

This chemical affects our nervous system the most which stops the mental development of children , headache , mental depression and pain in the neck are there.	4.795000113729841

Although in the west people have almost shunned milk , but in India milk has remained the synonym for good health.	3.6522095315552563

Therefore any argument against it would not be acceptable to the common man.	5.728884124143724

Even though it is important to tell in its relation that the milk of animal is meant for the animals.	5.057752892170273

A child can drink one 's mother 's milk till the age of three years.	5.362843348168204

Because till the age of three years those chemicals rennin and lactose are there in the child 's body which could digest the milk.	4.779627962271229

That is it dissolves the element Casein that is found in the milk.	5.273226694997773

But after the age of three years these chemicals rennin and lactose end automatically and then the element casein found in the milk is not able to get digested and slowly keeps on accumulating in the intestine.	4.025718198271152

In order to clean up this material mucous is created in large quantity and slowly it gives rise to many diseases.	3.992573498298417

If you are suffering from diseases like tonsil , bronchitis then immediately stop the milk.	4.824144824201695

In reality the calcium found in the milk is itself the main reason behind many diseases.	5.045894474781085

The large quantity of phosphorous in milk forces the blood to extract calcium from the healthy bones and teeth of the body.	5.146822173341677

The calcium found in the milk produces an excess of calcium in the blood which creates tumor , cataract , stone in the kidneys and gall bladder.	4.468510383043287

The calcium found in the milk gives rise to common diseases like problems of bones , spondilitis , sciatica , etc.	4.397750439799428

Cough and cold , sinusaitis , epistaxis and hay fever etc are among the major disease of nose ... ....	4.4481531690238985

Cough and cold occurs by the bacteria which is always present in upper respiratory tract.	4.599418176990024

When the body is healthy then these bacteria remains weak but as soon as the strength of body diminishes because of cold etc or in those people whose immune power has decreased then the bacteria becomes empowered.	4.502201224358579

There are many symptoms of cough and cold like shivering of the body , sneezing , blowing from the nose , flow of water from eyes , pain in the throat and excessive thirst.	5.437988268983576

There could also be slight fever in the cough and cold.	7.42330586713714

If because of some irresponsible acts its effects appear then give Reiki to the following centres many times a day , the disease will end in one day itself.	4.812733599919733

Pituitary gland , heart chakra , solar plexus and liver and besides this lungs etc are its center.	5.001891775637841

Give the elements with Vitamin C or its tablets in large quantity to the patients of sinusitis and cough and cold.	5.135717161210169

Because of hay fever many people are not able to sleep properly and they begin to suffer from diarrohea.	4.756465622360537

By giving Reiki at the centres of cough and cold this disease is cured.	5.127320069246798

The major among the diseases of throat are tonsil , adenoids and goitre etc.	5.584770439846496

In the mouth at the beginning of the throat where there is oesophagus and wind pipe , there are two glands there.	5.342958137945424

These glands are called tonsils.	11.758097002946347

Similar glands situated towards the upper portion of throat in the way of wind pipe are called adenoids or pharyngeal tonsils.	4.443074024033457

Tonsil has a very important role in keeping the body disease-free.	4.851982004430759

As soon as the germs try to enter into the body through the way of mouth , tonsil terminates them.	3.937477502705168

In this way tonsil protects the body from many diseases.	5.575500872049947

Tonsil is also helpful in the formation of the white blood cells.	7.03677160142582

In the condition of infection it becomes bigger in size and hard.	4.550747912807001

In the condition of infection first it becomes deep red in color and then later pus begins to come out.	3.7114779731995378

Lots of problems begin to occur in swallowing the edible objects , sometime there is cough and fever also , swellings occur in the throat.	4.516343492938241

Generally this disease increases while sleeping , one feels the thirst again and again.	4.965535305236161

It generally happens by cold , abnormality in milk , ice , icecream , the fried materials and ringworm etc.	3.8695606261852626

Adenoids are some extended pieces of flesh exactly at the back of the nose , connected to the membrane of the naso-pharunx.	5.160684412330134

When adenoids increase then there is lot of pain.	10.899832344628482

Adenoid disease is also genrally found in the children.	11.626432899821902

goitre is the disease of knot formation and swelling in the throat.	7.8224782614879445

goitre mainly occurs because of the deficiency of iodine.	7.359086008444343

There is a very serious effect on the thyroid gland because of the deficiency of iodine.	4.5718818320285415

In order to remove the deficiency of iodine one should use iodised salt.	5.352978073148963

Soyabean oil and the soyabean products are harmful in adenoid disease.	5.957479797636411

By continuously giving Reiki at these centres for several days the above mentioned diseases could be cured.	5.187209333304124

Ajna chakra , throat chakra , soalr plexus , thyroid , spleen and root chakra are the principal ones.	4.417166628772495

In the last few years there is a lot of increase in the problem of cervical spondilitis.	6.867558772970532

In cervical spondilitis there is little to extreme pain in the neck.	5.787653693187329

Some swelling occurs on the lower back side of the neck of many people.	8.145979994440307

Neck of many does not turn at all or turns a little.	5.583652772906244

Similarly the patients of slipped prolapsed disc is also increasing everyday.	5.7602995933494405

Mainly people think that the disc has come out by getting shaken.	6.526532822756296

When because of excessive work or some other reason there is no full natural expansion , no speed or rupture happens in the disc then pressure begins to fall on the nerves.	4.625594976180798

The capaciy of the spinal cord in the advancing age , picking up weight more than the strength or picking up in wrong way leads to slipped prolapsed disc.	3.9013804219448778

In order to remove pain like this the patient should take the food full of vitamin-c or its tablets.	5.175225519496552

The pain of sciatica is highly unbearable.	6.07550319651277

There are mainy reasons behind sciatica pain like - the distorted construction of the lumber region of the spinal cord , appearance of some abnormality in this part of the cord.	4.310615875165577

Arthritis , any kind of boil , swelling or lump near the spinal cord , swelling in any part of spinal cord especially the bones of lumber region , swelling in the bone of the buttocks or any part of the lower portion of stomach etc can be the symptoms of sciatica.	6.03725279550871

Sciatica disease can also occur because of any problem in colon and old dyssentry.	8.087455192403937

If there is swelling or jerk in any part of body , which is related to the ....nerve then the pain in sciatica begins.	5.053538846359433

If the kidneys do not perform properly and there is excess formation of uric acid then also pain in Sciatica begins.	5.06264370355996

In sciatica pain from a normal pain to unbearable pain can begin at the lower protion of the back and reach till the feet through buttocks or leg.	4.367801936528872

This pain is generally felt in one leg and that too generally one the outer side of the leg.	4.679039429440373

It happens so because the muscles shrimp somewhat because of the cold.	6.815529980898165

In order to cure.disease give Reiki to lumber , sacrum , kidneys and urine bag , sacral chakra , root chakra , back solar plexus and the local centres everyday for almost half an hour for several days.	3.3968681779447074

Heart is situated in between both the lungs , towards the left of the chest in between the third to the sixth rib.	5.34950411164655

Heart is the main axis of human 's life.	6.724843139581095

Those diseases which are related to the structure of the heart and its internal abnormalities they are called organic disorders.	6.317469639014319

The major diseases among the heart and blood circulation diseases are high blood pressure , low blood pressure , valvular disorders , heart ... ....disease , arterio sclirosis , hardening of blood vessles etc.	4.308136645607278

The disease of high blood pressure does not come all of a sudden.	5.57570510866977

It comes slowly after giving premonitions of several kinds.	6.984585642196199

If high blood pressure is not treated on time then heart attack , disease of kidneys , paralysis and many diseases of eyes may occur.	5.994272700058836

Angina Pectoris occurs because of high blood pressure.	7.533517027112151

When sufficient quantity of oxygen is not able to reach heart because of contraction of artries and the heart has to exert more pressure for carrying out its normal work then angina disease occurs.	4.126520356205137

Angina disease increases because of ciggarette.	11.011290411767549

Never give Reiki on the front heart chakra of heart patient.	5.7005045872891

In case of emergency when there is a heart attack then immediately give Reiki on the back heart chakra.	5.657122620152768

Along with this make your posture on the left hand of the patient and press the front of his fingers and thumb with all your strength , heart attck will stop immediately.	4.996825212222459

I have used this method several times in very serious circumstances and got success.	5.060235321003524

In ... ... ....posture press the front part of both the middle and ring finger and thumb after bringing them together.	4.5710432852943175

National Institution of Nutrition , Hyderabad has researched that the seeds of fenugreek are panacea for the diabetes patients.	3.7647757741935153

By eating 25 to 100 gm fenugreek mixed in curry or soup or else chappati diabtes can be controlled.	3.4942179619974247

From among the objects told above use only one or two objects at one time.	4.875084363152043

It is not right to eat all the objects at once.	5.389130511289232

Besides this give Reiki to centres like pancreas , ajna chakra , solar plexus back and front , thyroid gland , live , kidneys and hara chakra etc the disease will be soon cured.	3.429027448757928

By treatment with above Reiki miraculous results have come to the fore and diabetes have been cured soon.	4.632279841914452

The most painful aspect of the joints and bones diseases is that in the condition of the increase in disease deformity appears in many body parts.	4.743162616904384

Due to the occurrence of deformity in the joints and bones the patients are not able to walk and neither are they able to do any work with ease.	5.17280956578982

One doctor from America had written in his book that man has reached on the moon but he does not have any cure for joint inflammation.	4.250827463928035

One should go to the nature itself for the treatment of this disease.	5.290198885908263

Reiki is the best solution for the joints and bones diseases.	6.451757108777046

In order to give motion to the body there are several joints of bones which are called joints.	5.238867813598997

Except skull , all other bones of the body are mobile.	8.524195414660205

Arthritis is the disease related to these very joint of bones.	8.415930331373572

Ligaments do the job of keeping these bones connected among themselves.	6.2127817586938985

Besides these some fluid materials continuously keep the surface of the bones lubricated due to which the speed of the joints remain natural and easy and while moving they do not have any kind of pain.	4.73303305784578

There are sacs of liquid material near many joints which is called bursae.	5.535643603724602

In the joint inflammation diseases in addition to the swelling of joints there is an increase in the temperature of the body.	4.146194363762158

Muscles , tendons and nerves are also affected.	8.019025505077053

In this disease the blood vessels related to synovial membrane becomes flat from normal shape.	4.289917619372541

These blood vessels get more supply of blood than earlier due to which protein present in the blood and some other fluid material get accumulated around the joints through the blood vessels.	5.133012288450739

Due to this swelling occurs in the joints.	7.8046168170195385

When the blood vessels collide with the joints then there is pain.	7.314409404488476

Those people who take more than 12 to 18 hours in the digestion they have a greater possibilty of contracting this disease.	4.269596791433694

In addition to this those people in whose blood there is a large quantity of acid and calcium materials arthritis disease is seen in them also.	5.09995900365251

Those people who take excessive wine and beer and take a lot of nutritious food and do not exercise , their liver and kidneys are not able to work properly , they contract arthritis disease.	5.0005470995773535

In many people arthritis disease is paternal also.	6.229185012786253

Rheumatoid arthritis is seen three times in women in comparison to men.	6.761661817747593

Small viruses could also become the reason behind rheumatoid arthritis.	6.91239883346904

Rheumatoid arthritis disease generally starts slowly.	9.073781606164419

In the beginning rheumatoid arthritis disease attacks the hannds and the legs.	4.5136510294663

Sometime in rheumatoid arthritis there is pain only in the knees.	7.305595296328843

According to the symptoms while waking up in the morning there is greater stiffness in the body parts and as the afternoon comes in , pain and stiffness decreases.	5.661424635061534

If this disease is not treated properly then heart and lungs could also be adversely affected.	5.084785997416576

Osteoarthritis generally this disease affects the people of middle age.	7.311253037616734

The symptoms of osteoarthritis is specially seen in the women.	6.6078915955197886

Those women in whom this disease is seen more their menstruation ceases completely.	7.070701525623718

Osteoarthritis disease genrally affects fat people.	8.055789788081675

In osteoarthritis those joints are affected more on which the weight of the body falls i.e.spinal cord , kness and hips.	4.5957339679453035

Gout generally this disease affects men.	9.071666905002555

Gout disease genrally affects the men above the age of 40 years.	4.545699245825369

In women this disease is very rarely seen.	9.406719626848062

Doctors are of the view that when some special protein elements purinis is not able to digest properly then this element is transformed into uric acid.	4.2704706754715795

The crystals of uric acid begin to accumulate specially in joints and kidneys and skin.	4.425091917266687

The crystals of uric acid sharp and stinging like needles.	4.628316759068632

Gout starts suddenly.	20.77625304441601

In 90 % people gout starts from the joint of the thumb of the first leg.	5.95140949377589

Along with it the patient should drink water in greater quantity and should eat fresh and green vegetables.	4.6486936088453925

Along with it the patient is benefitted moraculously by doing Reiki and with continuous treatment gout is treated completely.	4.185558383459721

While doing Reiki the patient will feel that the disease is completely cured after three-four days , but after that he will feel it again but after this the disease will be cured slowly.	4.697581602679436

In this disease Reiki is to be given at the whole body.	5.52093383062495

Reiki should be given for longer time on centres like solar plexus , liver , spleen , ajna chakra , throat chakra etc.	4.836983455992569

The importance of ajna chakra is maximum from among the different chakras situated in our body.	4.195507032675453

Ajna chakra is situated in the middle of our head i.e.in the middle of both the eyebrows.	5.917420381339534

It is also referred to as the third eye of Shiva.	5.136771926140364

This story is famous in the Puranas.	7.340158813014783

It is by opening this third eye Lord Shankar had produced the Agni Tejas and with that the disturbing Kamdeva was burnt into ashes.	3.30943832272627

Damyanti had protected her modesty from the tiger by producing the magnanimous fire flame from the third eye.	4.028834614604655

From both these stories it is concluded that ajna chara is extremely important for us.	4.736919469947701

Sanjay had been able to get divine vision only by the development of the third eye.	6.486194439835891

As a result of the third eye Sanjay had begun to see all the scenes of Mahabharta war as in a television.	3.4177270127664094

In the eyes of some people a special kind of attraction is found.	6.598913518189298

Special electronic waves flow through their eyes ... ... ... ....	7.227721363164947

This elctronic wave affects in both good and bad ways.	5.610840453557284

The incident of catching bad eye is common , this idea seems like superstition but there is a scientific fact in this idea and the reason behind this is this very electronic wave.	4.276708530847333

These electronic waves have a great impact on our life.	5.368778585133896

These electronic waves could be sharpened even more by Reiki.	5.308739065522013

I was becoming weaker day by day.	5.851953911314136

Doctor told me that there is infection in my lungs.	8.172863565022723

I did not panic as I had already learned Reiki.	5.1754756050973105

I did not take any medicine , only did Reiki.	6.183798791016154

In about 21 days I had become completely healthy.	6.145576611028042

Generally husband - wife consider pregnancy a chance incident while it is not completely true.	6.512571188910411

There is a necessity to spread a worldwide awareness about the safe time for pregnancy.	3.852530494043718

In the absence of this awareness one third children and two lacs mothers become the victim of death every year.	3.8953678028692598

It could be stopped if we know the safe time for pregnancy and instead of considering it a chance incident , we know that pregnancy occurs only according to the wishes of the husband - wife.	3.676060832278499

What is maternal death ? 	10.560797939054067

In pregnancy , if during child - birth or within six weeks of child - birth , if the woman dies , then it is called maternal death.	4.571929770774414

Mother could also be freed of different kinds of diseases.	6.623743345920475

The meaning of lowering of mortality rate is the preservation of family , healthy nutrition and happiness in the society.	3.7033072070879394

But any woman is not always suitable for procreation.	6.722971912738191

The best period for pregnancy is from twenty to thirty years of age.	4.254517647115276

In this scientific age the medical science has developed so much that we have begin to understand the importance of the health of the child being brought up in the womb.	4.802041090575332

The age of procreation capability of a woman is generally accepted as 15 - 45 years.	5.055406859291648

The first five years and the last ten years of the procreation capability of women ' s life is full of risk.	5.2030244472701

If the common man could understand the terrible consequences of these 15 years of procreation then the long duration of procreation would come down to 15 years from 30 years.	3.756292129238415

That means from the age of 20 years to 35 years.	7.555500699801532

This will automatically give strength to the family planning program.	6.691274695831927

Most of the have this illusion that the sex of the child depends on the mother , which is wrong.	5.745904098245903

The ovum of the woman has only one kind of chromosomes xx.	6.179690889696488

By the fusion of one x of woman and one x chromosome of man a daughter xx and by the fusion of one x of woman and one y of woman a son xy is born.	2.6832618984356063

Thus birth of son or daughter depends on their father and not on their mother.	4.92292993550012

Now a days the services related to the tests during pregnancy in the antenatal of hospitals and before pregnancy and marriage-related advice in the pregnancy clinics have been started.	3.933227398379234

The health of mother could also become suitable for the second child , not before this.	5.225169538209016

In young age i.e.at the age of less than 18 to 20 years if there is abortion then many complexities increase.	5.802717165586002

That is why it is said that before becoming pregnant it is necessary that a girl becomes a complete woman.	4.3737585869630236

Because of the pregnancy in young age girls become physically and mentally weak.	4.445487173090345

In young age the girls are not so mature as to handle all the responsibilities of a mother.	4.854466733066581

In them incidents of spontaneous abortion and termination of pregnancy happen more.	4.518732566910561

Due to abortion the dangers related to it are also there , like anemia , infection , excessive blood-loss etc.	4.816131787373187

Along with pregnancy in the young age increase in blood pressure and loss of blood from body and presence of protein in urine are also found.	5.437230426125236

Because of pregnancy in young age deficiency in blood occurs and child birth is also painful.	4.6634562784391775

During child birth the natural pain , meaning labor pain is not proper.	6.224319653622509

Because of improper development of the hip bone and the womb there is a need for surgery.	5.670190129862474

Because of pregnancy in young age often the child is born prematurely.	4.788861759950166

The child remains ill because of incomplete development.	6.0067216293611985

Sometimes because of the pregnancy in young age the child even dies.	6.562976705554406

After the pregnancy in young age often the mother becomes a victim of mental diseases.	4.934511244163354

Sometimes the stress increases to such level that mother commits suicide.	4.699327164865244

Bing a mother in advanced age meaning after 30-35 years of age is also extremely dangerous.	6.054491373957933

The maximum fertility strength of a woman is in the age of 23 years which slowly decreases.	5.7500294279762905

In the age of forty years there is very little pregnancy.	5.251331089916467

In advanced age the chances of abortion also increase by pregnancy.	5.969737177977094

In advanced age blood pressure increases and the chances of heart disease increases with pregnancy.	6.090790081027461

In advanced age the effect of blood impurity increases during conception to pregnancy.	5.319057251294827

In advanced age there is a greater chance of vomiting because of pregnancy or blood loss during pregnancy.	4.905485079996999

In advancing age often excrescence forms in the womb.	6.375689301114051

This excrescence produces pain during pregnancy and causes obstacles during child birth.	6.05748395164667

Due to which child birth is done through surgery and not naturally.	6.504597764070256

The labor pain starts before the scheduled time and the birth of child also takes place before scheduled time.	5.095069235859962

With the advancing age there is an effect on the elasticity of the joints also and many time times placenta is also retained.	4.590354358571769

With the increase in the need for more surgery the danger for surgeons could also increase.	5.556009400417282

In the children born in advanced age there is an expansion of the innate defects.	4.888275645040301

Most of the children are born with innate physical defects like organ-fractures or limb disorder.	4.304162379170684

The innate physical defects of the children are also called ' Mangol Triguna Sutrata '.	6.235719698029401

With advancing age sometimes the child dies in the womb itself.	6.861040600828519

Dangers are not only in the pregnancy during young age or advanced age rather excessive pregnancy meaning if there are four or more children then there is a great increase in the mortality rate.	5.3824347215971455

Many types of danger also arise because of excessive pregnancy.	7.056363771009531

During pregnancy development of the child takes place in the womb of the mother itself.	7.310556551188229

The elements which are required for the formation of human body , the child is dependent on the body of the mother for all that.	6.771528139815457

It could be easily understood that during pregnancy there is a deficiency of many important elements in the mother 's body.	5.563616819473872

Among these the main elements are iron , calcium and protein.	6.095002363642761

During the period of breast feeding the child also the mother 's need of calcium and protein is almost double of the normal.	5.0119973751255635

Deficiency of blood could also be lethal.	10.584470497640604

The woman does not get opportunity to give complete meal to her body and make it healthy.	6.009190021971144

Because of deficiency in hemoglobin percentage deficiency of calcium occurs in the body.	5.21896096027651

As a consequence of the deficiency of calcium occurrence of ostomellisia is possible.	5.040504245917157

During pregnancy , during child birth or after child birth excess blood loss.	5.029023505799135

There is also the danger of bursting of womb because of the deficiency of nutritious elements.	6.223879171307426

In womb there are more incidents of twin children and placenta process.	5.924840002903354

RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VAUX V_VM JJ N_NN PSP PR_PRP N_NN V_VAUX V_VAUX V_VM JJ JJ N_NN RP_RPD PSP N_NN QT_QTF N_NST PSP N_NN 	3.2179168148025292

Because of the deficiency of protein in women the immunity of the body decreases.	7.250895572581357

Because of the low immunity the mother easily becomes a victim of other diseases.	4.575620009588436

The mother could be mentally satisfied and happy only when she is physically healthy.	4.293975176500087

Mother becomes weak because of frequent pregnancy , neither is she able to carry the extra burden of child fostering nor can she remain happy.	3.6413342993053144

If the difference between two children is not of two years then the probability of the death of the child increases by fifty per cent.	4.933855066749391

The information of some mothers regarding pregnancy is either incomplete or is based on some superstitions.	4.384128593564143

The mothers who are victim of the superstitions believe that till the first child is breast feeding she could not become pregnant.	4.349298094317343

In reality becoming pregnant and breast feeding the child there is no scientific relation between these two.	5.215604951554851

The mobile health centres may contact the mothers in the villages , show them some such documentary films which could remove their ignorance.	3.7568576517780183

Some couple do not use the contraceptive techniques of family planning.	6.051726326711853

These outer means seem to be like obstacle in the way of the pleasure at that moment.	4.969628926922437

Such couples are kindly requested to go to the nearest health center and get complete information in this regard.	4.805768701978049

So that the marital bliss is also maintained and they could also get information regarding the right time of pregnancy.	4.21843329731649

Now that time has come when scientific development has eased a lot of problems but for this the couple should take advice from their doctor without any hesitation.	4.852778173443685

It is mostly seen that little educated people out of shame neither tell the whole thing to the doctor nor they are able to ask anything.	4.165961189637036

But there is nothing bad in getting complete information , even if that is related to the right time of pregnancy.	4.744828601459359

You should also have the information related to the infant.	7.277942973158135

There is bad effect on the child in the womb in case of pregnancy on an inappropriate time.	5.559074340525523

The weight of the child born fully mature is 2,500 gram.	6.029189042823523

For the child to develop completely it is necessary to remain in the womb of the mother for 37 weeks.	6.054624145878271

If the weight of the infant is less or is born before the 37 weeks then he will be weak and there will always be a fear of his being ill.	4.971752656574632

Those children whose weight is less than 2,500 gram and length less than 44 c.m.at the time of birth their parts of head and stomach are relatively big.	4.191934678019613

If there is incomplete development of bones , then its effect is also there on the internal organs of the body.	4.827985139634163

Lot of times lungs are not able to expand completely because of incomplete development of the respiratory system and the weakness of their muscles , consequently they have a deficiency of oxygen.	4.625400298921194

There is a bad effect on the development of the body because of the deficiency of oxygen.	6.664872933257195

As a result of this these children remain quite close to diseases or death.	3.9797268629254914

Following diseases are frequently found in such types of children like asthma , breathing problem , secretion of blood in the brain , unconsciousness , the disease of jaundice etc.	5.321082154493034

There is a probability of getting relief from all these diseases and problems by pregnancy at the right time.	4.2880250765340175

After the birth of a healthy child there is less difficulty in his nurturing and there is also great gain in his physical and mental development.	5.496234398111768

Good health is the base of all happiness.	7.125191344382633

Who is healthy ?.	15.470854426526097

If one ' s all three doshas vata , pitta and kapha are balanced then he is healthy.	4.473654128872549

If the seven elements maintaining the body juice , blood , flesh , fat , skeleton , marrow and virility are in appropriate ratio then that person is healthy.	3.756459778129815

Besides this if the process of excretion happens in proper way and the ten senses ears , nose , eyes , skin , taste , anus , genitalia , hands , legs and tongue , mind and their master soul is also happy then such person is also called healthy.	4.169960863302524

For the attainment of health diet , sleep and celibacy are the three pillars.	5.388865704188733

This body is supported on these three bases itself.	5.389138837628693

One whose diet , pleasure , thought and behavior are balanced and controlled he is yogi.	4.672889060969027

One in whose work there is divinity , there is always purity and longing for well-being in the mind , whose sleeping and waking up is regular only he is the true yogi.	3.9997832837706526

A person 's body is formed by the diet.	7.994741202196092

Diet has a great effect not only on the body but also on the mind.	7.166302387302135

In relation to the diet an illustration by Maharishi Charaka is very elegant.	4.099885816668222

Once upon a time Maharishi Chakra asked his disciples who is healthy ?.	4.556649900326758

The one who has food which is beneficial in proper quantity and in consonance with weather is healthy.	4.865008190459833

Know your nature vaata , pitta , kapha and take the food accordingly.	6.359862794074991

If it is vaata nature there is air defect in the body then shun gassy food like rice etc.and sour food.	4.146806325747533

One should continue using small dried catkins , dry ginger , etc.	4.932974369017337

Those with pitta nature should not take hot , fried products.	6.077157924773476

Raw food like long gourd , pumpkin , cucumber , etc.are beneficial.	5.428084419337567

Those with kapha nature should not take cold food rice , curd , buttermilk etc.should not take in excess quantity.	4.400527003405643

One should take milk by mixing , small dry catkins , turmeric etc.in it.	4.276377272037357

Food should be taken in appropriate quantity.	9.139057841517733

Half of the stomach is for food , keeping one-fourth for the drinks it is appropriate to leave the rest for the air.	4.961183938927922

By taking the food by matching it according to the season diseases do not come near.	5.977905439286651

Food taken at wrong time produces illness by causing indigestion.	5.532773774634074

In the morning in between eight to nine it is good to take light drink , fruit etc.	4.46508997070587

The less the use of food in the morning , the better it is for the body.	7.6000116991353055

It is better if the people of above fifty years do not take Praataraasha.	5.7939229510031325

It is best to take food in the forenoon from eleven to twelve o'clock.	4.505871895672781

The time from twelve to one is medium , after the time is successively bad.	4.588199800614119

In the evening the time from seven to eight is best , time from eight to nine is medium and after nine it becomes successively bad.	3.596593666478078

Due to talking during eating , the food could not be chewed well and more food is also eaten.	5.377248276800363

Therefore while taking food one should keep quiet by remembering Lord Rama and eat the food by chewing well.	5.143052813288304

A mouthful should be chewed thirty two times or at least twenty times.	5.010219322010828

One also gets freedom from violent thoughts by eating by chewing because we all know that when someone is angry the person begins to grinds his teeth.	3.6065155667853284

Actually , the human body is made up of 70 % water as per nature.	6.778572049432227

Water is found from human cells to bones , muscles and blood.	5.979702757856375

How much water is necessary for which part of the body , this is controlled by the endocrine system present in the body.	4.973245746553255

The responsibility of taking the nutrients and the waste products of the body from one place to the other in a systematic manner is only of the water.	4.927104223837164

First of all our mind is affected by the deficiency of water or bad quality of the water.	5.849708537233797

In the case of dehydration the first symptoms of deficiency of water is seen when there is 2 % deficiency of water in the body.	4.539176022942603

In order to stop this dehydration our skin and hair become that delicate barrier which ensures that the water present in the body is lost as little as possible.	4.031157874121771

On reaching this point the cells of the skin begins to hang in the form of wrinkles by leaving its naturalness.	5.478280917872823

In order to give a healthy form to the skin it is necessary that it is nourished by those products , which nourishes the skin by making a proper balance of the water.	4.665444964955383

Along with the skin the presence of water in the hair is also very essential.	8.217516665215646

No matter how good a hairtyle is made with the rough and lifeless hair , its flourishing results will not come to the fore.	3.5910725698053723

In this case the court had asked if a 20 kg overweight pilot can get on the aeroplane , then how can a 500 gram overweight air hostess can be landed from the plane ?.	3.0077229947327675

Delhi High Court had pronounced this judgement on 4 May , 2006.	6.0555124579881205

Now a multi-member bench of Delhi High Court is rethinking on this.	4.070783459424821

In this diet carbohydrate is not included and its deficiency is accounted for by fat and protein intake.	4.276407752698298

Very often the doctor gives similar advice to the patients but the patients do not take it seriously.	5.804611133639184

They make themselves so busy in the daily life that even if they want they are not able to spare time for the exercise.	5.027073045306748

Several people defer it by saying that we walk everyday the exercise takes place by that only.	4.810372079570178

But doctors keep a different view regarding this.	6.677351154534367

Physiotherapy is related to the exercise.	13.090004667968165

According to Dr.Kanchan , physiotherapy is a kind of tretment , in which the patient is treated with different kinds of compress and exercises.	5.108011686191115

Generally people believe that physiotherapy is used for the treatment of only a few diseases but physiotherapy is beneficial in all diseases.	5.449532548485232

For example one breast of the women is removed because of the breast cancer.	6.778333868855157

They sit by keeping the hand towards the removed breast and when they have to remove the hand then the women face a lot of problem.	6.204599372141905

In continuous passive treatment the patient is continuously given several types of treatments.	6.984908337770746

Active movement is given to those patients , who can do the exercise by themselves i.e.they can move.	5.920505090803617

What is the difference between physiotherapy and yoga ?.	5.858613633064966

Answering this question Dr.Kanchan teels , the main purpose of physiotherapy is to give support to the bones by increasing the strength of the muscles.	4.701654322633389

The people who do yoga stress on only one thing that people of every age could do this but there is nothing like this in physiotherapy.	4.466366062419083

We think that every body has their own physique therefore we first examine the patient physically then exercise and treatment is given accordingly.	4.4163825176844576

You get strength through physiotherapy but in order to maintain that there is great need of physiotherapy.	6.2458372609691

Now a days children keep on sitting in front of TV all twenty four hours , which causes many problems in them.	3.860866763005873

The weakening or ending of the hearing capacity is called deafness.	4.97827805641792

Deafness could be little , medium or more , which depends on the capacity to hear.	5.856769633724953

Deafness has been divided into three parts.	5.970597109027684

The late occuring after the birth deafness related to brain and nerves.	6.641346451476637

In case of the presence of hereditary deafness from before when the child becomes capable of hearing-understanding some months after the birth at the age of 6 months then deafness could be reflected.	4.160228401907662

Besides this deafness could also occur because of the appearance of hardness in stepis bone and the spontaneous inactivity of the hearing organs after a certain age.	4.580554013092359

Deafness could also occur because of bacterial infection in the hearing organs because of swelling inside or middle of the ear.	5.211855811777574

Deafness can occur because of abnormal cell increase as in the case of blood cancer etc.	4.857719909522372

Deafness can also occur by virus infections or measles , mumps etc.	5.588875075726654

In order for the child to start speaking it is necessary for him to hear normally.	6.670344255040239

That is why the inborn deaf children could not also learn to speak , because neither are they able to hear anything nor respond to anything.	2.925435673752903

In the medical terminology the inborn deaf children are called ` huffmute '.	4.425076877224537

Treatment of deafness ' in which there is a greater chance of deafness being reflected because of the above mentioned reasons.	5.922481264340958

A proper testing of the hearing capacity of the child after the age of 6 months is extremely necessary.	6.063943311969048

These days there are problems related to the abdomen and the intestines which has become so common that every second person is either suffering it or keeps on suffering it from time to time.	3.5881159864812338

Although the problems related to the abdomen and the intestine are not fatal , but it creates anxiety , discomfort and pain in a large quantity.	4.489223311595398

The indications , symptoms and complaints in the diseases related to the abdomen and intestine are so similar that most of the doctors give some anatacid to the patient without arriving at a definite treatment , which reduces the symptoms to a large extent.	4.277120034649822

Since most of the diseases are so chronic , repetitive or prolonged in nature that it gets temporary relief.	4.945365474482673

After getting the relief once they forget the treatment and the medicine , and as a result of this the disease may surface again in the future.	4.525150012669513

Peptic ulcer acidic peptic disease ADP occurs because of the erosion or formation of ulcer in the internal parts of the abdomen.	5.126560094026227

Paeptic ulcer may occur because of excessive secretion of the gastric juice which melts or erodes the abdominal lining.	4.955963115442847

Peptic ulcer may occur because of the failure of the resistance system which reduces the loss because of the acid of the abdominal walls.	5.658751778402285

There is an extreme pain near the naval because of the formation of ulcer in the abdomen , the problems like vomiting etc could occur.	5.120480381870078

In many cases the gastric juice acid melts even the walls of the veins , which circulates blood in the abdomen.	4.450915090901887

There could be the secretion of black scum which is called melina and blood secretion in the abdomen because of the melting of the walls of veins.	6.01699664085395

Gastro Oesophysial Reflex ' or ` GERD ' is one such disease , in which the acid of the stomach goes into food pipe by reflex or moving backwards , whose internal lining is not resistant to the acid.	3.7482771426195836

There is a burning sensation or chest pain right in the middle of the chest which is called ` heart burn '.	5.164835021234091

This heart burn produces the illusion of angina or heart pain.	3.8121907070875225

Simple gas or formation of air is not any disease in itself.	6.047238727766754

In this condition belching exit of air through the mouth or flatulence exit of air through the anus increases.	3.734738388308743

Some specific materials like-milk , sprouts , cauliflower , cucumber , specific types of pulses produces the gas-related symptoms and condition in some people.	3.9732165509422157

The problem of gas could also occur because of taking in excessive air while taking meal.	5.055926329350835

But gas could not be said to be any disease except the one producing restlessness.	6.26555686384432

We have to say only this that recognize and avoid such food which produces gas.	6.287820987229796

Gastro Oesophysial Reflex Oesophagytis generally produces the illusion of angina or heart pain.	2.971509018705322

This pain could also be reduced by ` sorbitret ' because sorbitret also relaxes the oesophigal muscles , which reduces the pain.	4.673457093573791

Angina related illusion could be removed with the help of the ECG.	5.486581975985003

The pain of oesophagitis does not increase by walking or labor.	4.61375194126754

Stomach is an important part of the abdominal digestion.	9.09990869088157

The shape of the stomach is like that of a sack.	8.626089270992487

Human stomach is an elastic , muscular pear-shaped bag , which is situated in the blank space across abdomen below the diaphragm.	3.9364123566376175

Abdomen changes its shape and type according to the condition of the body itself.	7.8362532836842655

Abdomen is about 12 inch 30.5 cm long and 6 inch wide 15.2 cm at its most stretched point.	4.162719665324212

The capacity of the abdomen in an adult is 1 fudge 0.94 litre.	8.6752205848781

The food comes to the stomach through oesophagus.	8.861591307517395

The contact point of oesophagus and abdomen are called lower oesophageal or ` gastro estro oesophageal sphincter.	3.7614268794901076

This sphincter in the abdomen stops the food from going back into the oesophagus.	6.869484629613993

After the food reaches into the stomach gastric juice is used for the fragmentation of the food.	5.098739558527328

Some materials are absorbed by the muscule lining of the abdomen.	4.689728639317926

Wine is included in those materials whose absorption takes place in the abdomen itself.	6.352190723577968

The other part of the abdomen ` dudaenum ' remains empty.	7.892621022619016

Dudaenum is the first part of the small intestine.	8.741879241232516

Pyleric sphincter separates the stomach from the dudaenum.	7.709251640602201

Abdomen is made up of five layers.	9.292953554110124

If we look towards outside from the internal part then the most internal first layer is called ` mucosa '.	4.430648087282074

The formation of acidic and digestion juice takes place in the mucosa.	5.787760338523486

The layer after this is called ` submucosa '.	11.95382730401648

In the emty condition the abdomen shrinks and mucosa and submucosa fold , which is called ` ruge '.	4.746817203430546

When the food comes in it then ruge expands again.	6.375958302947563

Submucosa is surrounded by ` musculeris ' that layer of muscle which the edible products get in the abdomen and produces speed in them.	4.556180165254889

The other two layers ` subsirosa ' and ` sirosa ' does the job of wrapping the abdomen in one way.	4.275503856339531

Sirosa is the most outer layer of the abdomen.	10.064678736256145

If the internal lining of the abdomen is seen by the lens then it could be seen that it is covered by several small holes.	5.294239850334085

These small holes are the doors of gastric pits which is spread straight and in the form of branched tubewell till mucosa.	4.3400298259359635

These small holes of the internal lining of the abdomen forms the gastric glands.	4.733163480083607

Mainly four kinds of secreting ` epihelium cells ' cover the abdominal surface and elaborated or spread till gastric pits and glands.	3.7004221261907317

Mucous cells secrete basic mucous which saves the epithelium with excessive stress and acid.	4.624184331810638

Parietal cells ' secrete hydrochloric acid or if said in simple terms then acid.	5.244014190362463

Main cells secrete pepsin which is protiolytic enzyme for the fragmentation of protein.	4.595514806575807

G cells ' secrete the gastrine hormone.	10.185277085280852

Because of the basic mucous layer internal layer of the abdomen the abdominal walls are saved from burning by the acid secreted by ` parietal cells '.	4.319601166266401

Abdomen carries out the four basic works , which helps in the primary stages of the diestion.	5.113111393666682

These four works of food prepares the food for the processing by the intestines.	4.845608668052174

The abdomen works as a long term reservoir , in which the food could be taken in large quantity and they could be used for long time by stroing them.	6.191386010418227

It is the abdomen itself where the digestion with chemical and enzymes is started , especially that of protein.	4.25167786465574

The quick shrinking of gastric muscls is helpful in mixing the food with the gastric secreted materials.	5.136885309840312

As a result of this the food converts into liquid material in the stomach which prepares it for entering into the small intestine.	3.403637657220486

As soon as the food converts into liquid material in the stomach , it enters into the small intestine for further procesing.	4.029042311784592

Ulcer is an open wound or boiler which is found on the normal skin or the mucous membrane region of the body.	5.344859854456601

The ulcer present in the lining of stomach or dusenum where hydrochloric acid or pepsin is present is called peptic ulcer.	4.420246102004386

When this ulcer occurs in the stomach then it is called gastric ulcer.	7.020372362874679

When the ulcer occurs in dudenum then it is called dudenal ulcer.	6.1757177433312025

It was believed in the earlier times that the lifestyle-related reasons like stress and diet become the reason behind ulcer.	4.542743916648007

After this the researchers have established that hydrochloric acid and pepsin are also responsible for the formation of ulcer.	4.372738567928984

Peptic ulcer develops because of helicobacter pailori bacterium.	5.839329747488594

The research has made it clear that most of the ulcers occur because of infection with a bacteris helicobacter pailori.	4.915932339729846

Helicobacter pailori bacteria produces such mateials which weakens the mucous giving protection to the abdomen.	4.890573013165513

Because of the weakening of mucous acid and pepsin there is fatal effect on the abdomen and the formation of acid and pepsin begins even more quickly.	4.0920753658811275

The studies have told that the possibility of ulcer increases by smoking.	5.7062042099714265

There is also a negative impact on the treatment of ulcer by smoking and the possibility of increase in ulcer increases.	6.1063127517135705

However the increase in the secretion of acid in the abdomen is not just because of the caffeine.	7.780443738659033

Till now no direct relationship between peptic ulcer and the consumption of wine has become present.	4.980358353932752

But the established ulcer is found in large quantity in those persons , who have sirosis of liver and which is related to greater consumption of wine.	4.696645879550872

Although emotional stress is now not considered the main reason behind ulcer , yet the people suffering from ulcer complains that the pain of ulcer increases by emotional stress.	4.778442767783268

Physical stress could increase the danger of development of ulcer , especially in the abdomen.	6.565511208419759

In order to stop the ulcer from developing and stopping its complications there is a need for extensive treatment.	3.9715101836742375

It is believed that the deficiency in the capacity to protect oneself from strong digestive materials of the abdomen like hydrochloric aci and pepsin is a big reason of the formation of ulcer.	4.44646922479741

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory NSAIDs drugs like aspirin , ibruffen and naeproksen increases the dangerous effeect of acid and pepsin in the abdomen.	3.5127243198115523

These medicines are commonly present in the headache , small pain killers.	5.822345481377882

Ulcer does not always manifest some symptoms , but the common symptom of ulcer is the burning pain or glowing in between the chest bone and the naval.	4.61556611032577

This pain of ulcer is generally felt in between the two meals and in the morning time.	7.139787085615971

The duration of this pain of ulcer could be from few minutes to few hours.	5.479681141228762

The symptoms of abdominal and dudenal ulcer could be similar to other digestive conditions or general medical problems.	3.866367085345545

Please consult your doctor for the proper treatment of ulcer.	7.761319246613737

Serious complications could arise because of not taking proper treatment at proper time by the people suffering from ulcer.	5.79476923579875

Since ulcer erodes the muscles of abdominal and dudenum walls , which could lead to damage in the blood capillaries.	5.5145771256367135

The reason behind damage to the blood capillaries could be blood secretion.	5.709345459270338

Sometimes ulcer creates a hole by eating up the abdominal or dudenal wall , due to which bacteria and half-digested food jumps to the abdominal cavity paritonium which increases the infection in abdominal cavity and the wall.	3.9483354408923836

The ulcer situated at the other end of the abdomen where dudenum is attached causes swelling and wound , due to which the entrance of the intestine is closed.	4.495148781081246

Because of this reason by blockage the food could not come out of the abdomen and could not enter into the small intestine , due to which there is vomiting of materials present in the abdomen.	4.81434526394646

How can one detect the ulcer ?.	7.930894601589029

Since different kinds of methods are used for the treatment of different kinds of ulcers , therefore the correct treatment of ulcer or H Pylori is necessary before the treatment.	5.398114151208998

For example the treatment of ulcer produced by NSAID is very different from the ulcer produced by H Pylori.	4.92702771383302

There are many options for the correct treatment of the ulcer.	5.669099063671707

Similarly necessary options are available for the treatment of H.Pylori.	6.108642528164451

Included among these processes of treatment is upper GI Gastrointestinal Series.	5.5668229725981595

In gastrointestinal series a liquid material like chalk which is borium is given to the patient.	4.055023909839247

After this with the help of the x-ray of oesophaus , abdomen and dudenum the correct situation of the ulcer is examined.	4.115996167664141

In endoscopy a flexible instrument at the other end of which a camera is fixed is inserted into the oesophagus , abdomen and udenum through the mouth , so that the upper pipe could be seen completely.	4.2096719547966215

The testing of blood , respiration and abdominal tissues is carried out to find out the presence of H.Pylori.	4.709740159595142

In earlier times doctors used to give the patients the suggestion to keep away from fried , acidic , spiy and food having fat.	4.750536543207541

However for the right treatment of ulcer bland food has no longer remained effective.	5.697518414435763

Those people who find it that some foods create restlessness in them they should consult their doctor.	4.199988764266798

Smoking is related to ulcer not being cured and its being born again , therefore ulcer infected people should not smoke.	4.683673261226623

Doctors treat the ulcer of abdomen and dudenum with the following medicines.	6.255331346267381

H2 blocker reduces the quantity of acid in the abdomen by stopping the repoduction of histamin which is responsible for secreting acid in the abdomen.	4.626181176179231

There is a complete seizure of production of acid in the abdomen by the medicines for stopping the pump of acid.	5.136691251308331

By this acid pump the main place of acid secretion is stoped.	5.122122988218307

Antacid  ` mucozal protective agent ' is used to protect the mucous lining of the abdomen from the harm caused by the acid.	5.086407106625626

Antacid.Mucozal protective agent does not reduce the secretion of acid.	5.793564847387659

During the treatment of H.Pylori these medicines are used with other antibiotics.	6.439999221269516

The discovery of relation between ulcer and H.Pylori has given birth to a new alternative antibiotics treatment.	4.7584901119306595

In most of the cases the anti ulcer-medicines cures the ulcer quickly and effectively.	3.800840619154475

By these medicines with the end of H.Pylori the possibility of ulcer coming up again reduces.	5.725432975558061

However those patients on whom the medicines are not effective or who slowly develop complexities , they may need operation.	4.4699707808798825

In today 's times laproscopic surgery is being brought into use for the treatment of ulcer.	4.2638992716669675

In ` vagotiomy ' process vagus a nerve which functions to send the message from the mind to the abdominal nerve is being cut so that the signal could be stopped and the secretion of acid could not take place in the abdomen.	4.17291496325786

In ` entrectomy ' the lower portion of the stomach is removed because it produces a hormone which is responsible for the secretion of digestive juice in the stomach.	4.880969770179681

Pyloriplasty ' is that operation which could also be done with vagotomy.	7.761366805652852

In the pyloriplasty operation dudenum and small intestine pylorus are made bigger such that the activity of the edible materials could increase from the abdomen.	3.96226373964042

In the future the standard methods of laproscopic operation may become prevalent.	4.3604828892089085

Laproscope is an instrument of a long tube with camera which the surgeopn enters into the skin after putting small cuts and looks at the internal activity on a video monitor.	3.8157729799790827

Gastro oesophygal reflux disease GERD or reflux oesophegaitis is such a disease , in which the lower portion of the abdomen 's structure enters into the oesophagus due to which the lining of its soft part is destroyed by the acid.	4.219644253534165

As a result of this there is burning sensation in the upper portion of the abdomen which is called epigastric and lower middle chest.	4.876212088097758

Heart burn , burning sensation or restlessness in the chest bone or behind the sterman are the most common symptoms of acidity.	5.663730852870508

Along with this return of gastric material in the mouth or chest regurgitation may happen.	4.91567073518591

Oesophagus is a big pipe which takes the food from the empty place in the mouth to the stomach in the abdomen.	6.747669461196028

Oesophagus crosses the chest and passes through diaphragm.	8.209656350765549

Whenever the food comes in the upper protion of the oesophagus , this pipe starts a kind of activity , which is called ` peristalsis ' in which the food is brought from oesophagus to the abdomen below.	5.506305018116485

It takes less than one minute to bring the food or liquid material into the door of the mouth.	4.447367059625936

Here the acid secreted from the abdomen begins the digestive work on this food.	5.707199102412322

At the lower end of this pipe there is a gate protected by a thumb like muscles which keeps the lower part sealed so that the food material does not come back to oesophagus after reaching in the abdomen.	5.035269759644666

Among the main reasons of GERD unstable lower oesophigial sphincter relaxation , reduced LED resting tone , ineffective oesophigial clearance in the emptying of abdomen and deficiency in the production saliva are included.	3.2532049895516106

The most common symptom of GERD is heart burn.	5.51852791854749

The most posibility of occurrence of GERD is after the lunch in the day.	5.82947080357135

Some people feel the reflux during the sleep also.	5.878588885624308

The relation of nocturnal reflux while sleeping at the night is generally with more dangerous and excessive oesophigitis.	4.638990803645169

In this the acid remains in the oesophagus for longer time.	5.248389439980463

Because there is deficiency in the quantity of production and swallowing of saliva for deactivating the acid.	5.466959379577132

The determination of the symptoms of the loss of oesophigial mucozal and its quantity mainly depends on the quantity of refluxed material and time of the contact of acid in the oesophigial.	5.332458739423826

In the patients suffering from the acidity their internal mucozal resistance system is affected by the excessive reflux , which produces many other symptoms also.	4.453522261385107

There are many options for the treatment of the GERD , in which change in normal lifestyle to treatment are included.	3.529982130747466

The motive of the treatment of the GERD is to reduce or end its symptoms.	5.580872390929925

To fill up the damage of the damaged cells of the oesophagus.	6.97421090427592

The motives of the treatment of GERD are to avoid the spicy , fatty and fried food.	6.082228898841179

Exercising regularly and reducing the excessive weight of the body could be a good beginning towards the prevention of GERD disease.	5.613022878139717

Try to take the meal two hours before sleeping.	7.189607178490143

Keeping the head of one 's bed slightly high could also be beneficial in the GERD disease.	6.75444528218835

Most of the food materials which have carbohydrate could be the reason for gas.	7.786144110785515

The food materials opposite to this which have fat or protein , produces less fat.	4.871794496002137

Raphinage , lacose , fructos and sarbitol are small carbohydrate.	6.68077060541812

However comparatively it is in less quantity in cauliflower , sprouts , broccolli , other vegetables and whole cereals.	5.11842961358458

The natural sharcara present in the milk is called lactose.	5.8441354508351315

Lactose is also found in sufficient quantity in milk products like cheese , ice cream , processed food like bread , cereals and salad dressing.	4.5177219828290935

Fructose is naturally found in onion , pineapple and wheat etc.	5.8230258150339465

Fructose is used to produce sweetness in drinks and fruit juice.	6.278401558517594

Sorbitol is that sarcara which is naturally found in the fruits in which apple , pineapple , peach and prune are included.	4.490308111535396

It is used to bring artificial sweetness in dietic food materials and sarcara-less toffees and chewing gums.	3.9315226790743547

Most of the starch , in which potato , cereal , noodles and wheat etc are included , they produce gas because their disintegration and digestion takes place in the large intestine.	3.8133261603521142

Rice is the only starch which is not responsible for producing gas.	7.34668900327763

Generally all vegetables and fruits are considered good source of fiber.	6.770398436403188

Any food material which is with peel has fibers.	6.483555936041619

Whole cereals , pulses with covering also have fibers.	7.722855082109486

In many food materials there are soluble and insoluble fiber.	5.071752284070932

Soluble fiber dissolves in the water easily and forms a soft jail like shape in the intestines.	5.515980147493366

The disintegration and digestion of soluble fiber does not take place until it does not reach large intestine , where the digestion leads to the production of gas.	5.046080314356684

On the other hand insoluble fiber passes through the intestines without any change and produces less gas.	3.742314005655739

Insoluble fiber produces less gas.	10.730871270663844

Those food mateials which could produce gas in some people , they may not have any effect on the others.	5.496867300733619

Some common bacteria present in the large intestine may destroy the hydrogen produced by the other bacteria.	5.2722304761142995

The balance of these two bacteria explains the fact that why gas is formed in some people in larger quantity than in the others.	4.842830129596705

Gas is produced in almost every person , which is issued out either by belching or through stool.	4.551107000229992

Although many people think that they have a greater gas problem while in reality its quantity is normal.	5.262469157036355

Most of the people produce 1 to 3 pint gas everyday and pass the gas around 14 times everyday.	3.6686622555641084

Gas is primarily formed by the mixture of odourised vapor carbon dioxide , oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen and sometimes methane.	3.775360376239637

The unpleasant odourof flatulence comes by that bacteria which is situated in the large intestine and which produces such gas , which has sulphur.	4.477569345648683

Understanding the reasons behind gas , paying attention to the methods of its reduction and treatment at the right time could only give riddance from this problem.	4.451889618841747

Swallowing the air is a common reason behind gas in the abdomen.	9.649537205788086

Every person swallows the air in some quantity while eating or drinking.	5.150302016868865

However eating or drinking quickly , smoking or wearing the loose artificial teeth etc also become the reason behind ` aerophisia ' in some people.	4.278502946423081

Burping or hiccup is that process in which nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide which is swallowed along with the air etc exit from the abdomen.	4.155828705080142

Its small quantity also goes into the large intestine where it exits through the way of rectum.	5.310371040024561

When the acid and bicarbonate are mixed in the abdomen , then carbon dioxide is also produced from the abdomen , but a large part of this gas is absorbed in the blood flow and does not enter into the large intestine.	4.797241237854004

Those people in whom there is production of methane gas in larger quantity , it is not necessary that some special indication be present in them.	4.714506501723173

The stool of that person , in whom there is greater production of methane , continues to flow in the water.	4.330797620216775

The research has not been able to find why there is greater production of methane in some people when compared to the other people.	4.340979465600255

Otis flow ' disease generally takes place in the children.	6.971911546883481

Otis flow disease occurs in the middle of the ear because of the germs.	7.2758599124052195

This disease of otis flow could also occur because of syphilis , tonsilitis and old cough.	4.505205259108328

The children begin to suffer from the fits of ear pain.	5.263306804607453

When the pus begins to flow out then the pain reduces a litle.	5.110531005328593

After cleaning the ear properly with cotton after applying the spray of boric acid , blow in the boric iodine and apply the cotton afterwards.	3.7971393846358885

Clean the ear by putting hydrogen peroxide in the ear.	6.1006548134536525

Later on put in the cotton after pouring mercurochrome glycerin or aecriolect.	4.969498067715566

After dropping few drops of boric spirit in the ears and cleaning the ears in some time close it with the cotton.	6.07950803106863

In this disease injections of penicillin , strepo-penicillin , comaisin etc are beneficial.	3.909110185339895

Sometimes the pieces of gram , pea or cotton etc enter into the ear of children or adults , which are not able to come out and the patient feels very uncomfortable and laziness.	4.201491441119738

If it is not possible to remove the object in the ear for some time because of swelling etc then warm it by mixing boric acid in the hot water and spray the boric lotion in the ear after the swelling subsides.	4.826307049790433

By this the object fallen in the ear will be removed from its place and could be easily removed with the help of tweezers or matchstick.	4.277256559633481

It should be kept in mind that if insects enter into the ear then for removing that instead of using tweezers or matchstick one should fill it with the hot mustard oil so that the insect or any other thing gets drowned.	3.884752431070993

This way the object fallen in the ear could be easily removed.	4.887775259933687

If the tooth or the molar does not move then it is good to fill up silver in them.	4.467841080721441

If the tooth moves then it is better to bring it out.	6.13559013785405

One gets relief by applying carbolic acid or cotton buds with clove oil in the molar hole.	4.2163542094956945

Teeth are benfitted by taking ostocalcium or a similar medicine , in which the quantity of calcium is more.	4.859599554924814

In order to protect oneself against the teeth diseases it is beneficial to cleanse the teeth eveyday and use vitamin ` c '.	4.585273264785825

Second leucorrhoea which comes out of cervix.	8.379715725254202

The secretion coming out of the vagina is milky white or yellow and like thin curd during pregnancy.	3.9352497046732924

The secretion coming out of the cervix is sticky or with pus.	5.118536867542265

Mostly the young girls living in the dirty localities or dense population suffer from leucorrhoea.	4.535369697998458

The inflammation of pregnancy , syphillis , uterus cancer or tumor on the cervix , weakness etc are the main reasons of leucorrhoea.	4.318481611883906

Besides this there should be the treatment of other parts of the body which encourages the leucorrhoea disease.	6.413788748283122

1.Common salt 1 dram in 20 ounce.	6.329722080575883

2.Zinc Sulpahte 1 dram in 2 ounce , tincture iodine 30 m.in 20 ounce or copper sulphate 10 grains in 20 ounce.	4.042882945909898

Egg-white like secretion begins to come out because of the formation of wound in the cervix of the uterus.	5.551164127578032

In this the wound should be treated.	6.233853848870552

Give one tablet of the special medicines lakorina thrice in a day and two tablets of leukol thrice in a day.	3.7065148758504605

This study has also found the argument of arrival of obesity in children because of 100 percent consumption of fruit juice to be wrong.	3.965269098220567

According to Dr.Nicholas The condition of obesity in children has nothing to do with the hundred percent consumption of fruit juice.	3.506855931646123

This kind of research has proved that there is no danger of obesity in children because of hundred percent consumption of fruits.	4.575706178906291

Dr.Nicholas says , We have found that those children who do not take fruit juice , they have a grater danger of becoming obese.	5.021501383804934

Not only this , this fact has also come to the light by this research that juice consumers eat more fuit than non-juice consumers.	4.079634706703711

Dr.Khan tells that in the women who smoke there is a possibility of heart attack occuring 19 years earlier than in the women do not smoke.	6.565766196235787

If compared with the men then the danger of heart disease is more in women who smoke because the level of estrogen hormone , which is responsible for keeping them healthy , reduces because of this habit.	4.865459112340203

Those women who are engaged in the stress-related jobs they have a greater possibility of heart disease in comparison to those women who do not have to take decisions , while the truth is opposite for the men.	3.8945833566323493

In the female heart patients particularly young female patients a layer of cholestrol is not formed in the arteries.	4.789375501097595

People travel 1 to 4 hours daily for going to work from adjacent areas to main city.	4.500013291296187

In this life of haste number of vehicles running on the roads is bound to grow.	3.6998790128884957

From a crazy increase in automatic vehicles the rate of road accidents has increased rapidly.	4.482986243338586

As such public does not have any knowledge of small road accidents.	5.34190639727305

It has been seen that individuals hurt in big road accidents die even before reaching the hospital.	3.730492582047224

In deaths occurring in road accidents 75 % direct - indirect role is of chest wound.	5.269301549027409

Hence do not ignore chest wound and treat immediately.	7.033281219907239

The level of emergency health centres is very low in our country.	5.250178020042646

Neither is there a well founded arrangement for taking person injured in road accident to hospital and nor do the paramedics have the experience of taking injured people safely to the hospital without harming.	3.7351624106887287

In about 70 percent injuries of chest facture occurs in ribs.	5.2228160245095925

In about 80 percent people lungs get seriously damaged along with occurrence of rib fracture.	3.927876739685927

As a result of this blood and air fill up inside the chest.	4.148167602245023

Filling up of air inside chest is called pneumothorax while filling up of blood is called hemothorax.	4.88653495963855

If both these conditions are not treated immediately then in 80 percent cases there is a chance of death of a patient.	5.676625983671264

Flail chest does not contribute with the original chest in the process of breathing rather it works opposite to the original chest.	4.61487682036486

If ' flail chest ' is not treated properly right away then death is certain.	5.434765580770382

In such a condition what the family members of injured person need is that they take patient to a modern hospital equipped with all modern facilities and get an experienced thoracic surgeon to treat patient.	3.6512572202428535

It is dangerous to not do right treatment of ribs.	4.923917529453838

By this amount of carbon dioxide increases.	7.5715179369659005

Other parts of body like kidney , mind and heart stop working by this.	6.595740328029815

Do not tie bandage tightly.	7.5224236863305585

Patient reach orthopaedicians.	23.123703320135377

It has two disadvantages.	12.230612221384805

One that they waste the precious time received for treatment , second right assessment of injured lung does not happen and third , to escape from pain occurring in rib injury tight cloth is tied across the chest.	3.511129037218221

Sometimes chest is even plastered.	11.624940581453137

By it harm is caused to the patient instead of benefit.	5.998602112235594

Because of external pressure that is exerted on chest lung that is already injured is unable to inflate properly and it either shrinks or the possibility of pneumonia increases.	4.317668058267222

As a result of this breathing process of patient gets constrained.	4.855508783411948

Body should be filled out , weight should be right.	7.444820713025557

Not that one should be so thin that bone structure shows or so fat that tummy protrudes.	4.662775158952693

Lessening of weight is also not good and increasing weight much is also not good.	6.405037132727141

Weight should remain right in proportion to height of body.	5.901581058205522

The people whose weight is less such people should first of all eliminate digestion related defects.	5.0755711006631445

Tuberculosis : This disease happens from mycobacteria.	11.219108100609574

Every year about 30 lakh people die of this disease.	5.426482669639262

In this most deaths occur in developing countries.	5.21961014349753

In the world about 80 lakhs new tuberculosis patients are increasing , in which 95 % are in developing countries.	4.576977245342219

One patient of tuberculosis in whose expectoration tuberculosis bacteria are present is spreading the disease every year in 10 to 15 new people.	4.781608202417462

When tuberculosis disease is present in the country with such horridness then even children can not escape it.	5.834087585193416

When a tuberculosis patient coughs or sneezes then tuberculosis bacteria come out in thousands.	5.026123465893748

Their large drops do drop on the ground but minute drops keep floating in the air.	5.064033962511337

Tuberculosis patients are mostly poor , uneducated , where the whole family lives in a small closed room.	4.8749871422959

The number of bacteria in the room increases from coughing continuously which reach the bodies , lungs and other body parts of other family members through breath.	4.079677558098042

Children who stay weak immediately come in their grip.	6.344287025710061

It produces a reaction on reaching the lungs of children.	6.716380404763401

Finishing one cycle in 8 - 10 weeks bacteria reaches the stage of dormant.	6.3412127810949075

During this children may have common fever , cough , cold , coryza , etc which heals even without treatment but some children who are malnourished , are afflicted with some other serious disease or whose disease resistance capacity is weak , such a child needs treatment urgently.	3.634023463715187

One another tuberculin test is also conducted whose report is received after 48 to 72 hours.	4.664520484442216

Tuberculin test being positive shows that bacteria of tuberculosis have entered the child.	5.4154843670901185

In emaciated and sick , weak children this test may be negative even in presence of tuberculosis.	4.679410872836622

This test may be negative in those children also whose disease resistance capacity is weak.	4.199988482194875

Once diagnosis has been done one can get free of this disease on taking medicine regularly for six months under the care of a therapist.	6.233480526551163

Child can get seriously ill on not getting diagnosis or treatment on time or child can lose life.	4.6692356283579395

If these symptoms exist in children then there may be tuberculosis.	6.7901506069101005

Weight of child not increasing or remaining stable or reducing a little.	4.934288214625638

During treatment we met many such patients who had no knowledge of diabetes.	5.203074225152861

On seeing condition of gums and from other symptoms one detects the possibility of disease of diabetes which can be determined in pathology from testing the blood.	5.013422733440824

Dentists talk about extracting teeth merely on occurrence of a decrease in sugar amount in patient.	5.617148840069452

There is a wrong conception in some dentists that until blood sugar reduces wound will not heal from extraction of tooth.	3.841127440543154

Since this conception is produced because of misunderstandings hence from the point of view of the masses it is not an easy task to extract it.	4.245842178317227

Believe that as and when you shaking or decaying tooth keep coming out your graph of blood sugar will slowly start coming down.	4.254480075212174

Keep in mind that blood flow in body is maximum in the upper part of body meaning in head and mouth.	5.374945939363888

When there would be more blood flow there would also heal soon.	6.493253682474979

From too much flow of blood in the mouth wound of diabetes patients with more blood heals like that of a normal person and sugar also reduces from extracting all shaking teeth.	4.836131273258171

Keep in mind that blood sugar increases in a situation of pus anywhere in body.	4.714521133133873

Pus situated in gums reduces along with extraction of teeth , accordingly blood sugar also reduces.	4.101559709540577

Test teeth of children every 3 - 4 months and make child brush from the age of one year.	5.304310201458547

Get your teeth cleaned by a dentist every year.	5.727501820633282

There is good and cheap treatment of decayed teeth in the initial stage.	4.951066721773991

Eating carrot , radish , apple , fruit , etc remains beneficial for gums.	5.926034478038006

Our hair increases naturally about 1.25 to 1.5 cm in one month.	5.451344316950795

There is direct effect of food habits on the rate of growth of length of hair.	4.798173918870642

Also there is a hereditary pattern in the rate of increase in length of hair.	6.694953505993931

Often patients come with a problem that their hair grows very slowly in length or do not grow more after growing till a definite length.	3.672743621161992

Such a problem can be distributed in the following types.	6.609213957093432

The rate of growth of length in hair remains very slow.	4.502397232901124

Hair does not increase more after increasing till a definite length.	5.675402563553672

With merely a little increase in length hair becomes brown and split at the ends.	4.94660095485271

The biggest cause of a problem of this kind is deficiency of nutritious substances and lack of proper care.	7.5162796554378755

For the circle of hair to go on smoothly it is extremely necessary for the body to get iron , calcium , etc nutritious substances in the right amount.	4.72650753391262

This problem also arises because of not applying right oil in hair.	6.848686214974167

Not using the right shampoo is also its cause.	6.905941321140254

From use of harmful chemical comprising oil , shampoo , etc hair ends become split and brown.	4.164139693135977

Use of dryer on hair roots also stops hair growth and makes them rough and lifeless.	3.9995435325344944

If hair is not trimmed for a long time then also growth of hair gets affected.	4.862382985739481

Because hair ends break on becoming lifeless and hair starts tangling in itself.	4.959167723268048

Hereditary reason or family pattern is also responsible for hair growth.	5.922838827010729

Because the composition of hair depends on the composition of hair of parents.	5.689430496376851

If deficiencies of nutritious substances are visible in patient then medicine for the purpose of fulfilment of nutritious substances should be given.	5.523360927781387

Environmental pollution also stopping its growth makes hair rough and lifeless.	5.176738853992269

Hence one should save hair from environmental pollution also.	5.900710186271132

Because rough and lifeless hair grow very less in length.	4.966648094503893

Do not use any kind of soap for washing hair.	5.757438574718089

There is high detergent in soap that causes damage to hair.	5.072328397963105

The most important thing for leading the most successful and complete life is - energy.	4.265368693007096

There is infinite quantity of energy in every person , the necessity is to use it properly.	4.987107484609092

It is also said that ' if you have talent and energy then you are king , if you have energy but not talent then you are prince , but if you have talent but not energy then you will remain a beggar '.	4.669576520164764

Because of today ' s modern life style our natural energy is used less.	5.1878427666712765

Therefore by adopting some rules we can maintain our natural energy by which we can take full enjoyment of healthy life.	4.0997739458766524

We can maintain our energy by nutritious and balanced diet.	5.284201230938616

A healthy diet is 50 percent water based in which fruits and vegetables are included.	5.322915876286801

Include salad in the meal and by reducing caffeine , meat , dairy , sugar and snacks take nutritious food.	4.446738131676085

Regular exercise is also a brilliant source of increasing energy level.	7.311726525133078

For better health and energy it is very necessary to be aerobically trained because it supplies oxygen to the body.	5.014963650542581

Your lungs , heart , digestion etc will work better only when you are fit.	5.337670535973175

Research tells that if you have done 12 months of regular exercise then it will be useful for your whole life.	5.945675111767988

Even then do find at least three days in a week for exercise.	5.458609863770142

The lower portion of our lungs is larger than upper portion and a correct amount of oxygen is needed for breathing.	4.412789311479262

Generally taking less deep breaths is common as a result of which several problems also begin to come up in which reduction in energy level is also included.	4.202145126036666

Therefore take ' power breathing ' at least thrice a day.	4.569891048021381

For this inhale deeply by counting one , hold the breath by counting till four and by counting two , exhale.	3.9433254736109875

For example if you inhale deeply for four seconds the hold for 16 seconds and exhale in 8 seconds.	3.4256196101390564

Repeat this process for ten times.	8.169735386600017

In order to renew your energy adopt balanced life style.	4.7770411423061745

When we do a lot of and difficult work then in it energy is reduced in a large quantity and we gain nothing.	5.513296999372958

Therefore in order to become a successful person finish the work by dividing them properly , work after resting a little.	4.288991724438071

Balanced life is not formed naturally but it is formed by oneself by keeping in mind one ' s daily routine and work habit.	5.478885379390007

Emotions are also helpful in reducing our energy level to a large extent.	5.873002089270064

Those who live in negative emotions stress , depression or any kind of fear , they have a difficulty in being inspired and encouraged towards life.	4.332423188078944

On the other hand those people who are full of happiness and enthusiasm and who are optimistic have a great energy level.	4.4412085570304685

So adopt positive attitude in life and become optimistic by throwing out tension , fear.	4.616974369561945

There are also many other factors for increasing energy level but you could surely maintain your energy level by adopting these smaller things.	3.88605990520967

Its symptoms come to the fore very slowly therefore patients could not recognize that they have arthritis.	4.821379914374947

When swelling and harsh pain begins in joints then the problem is understood.	6.3705721398566215

The orthopaedic consultant of AIIMS Dr.Rajesh Malhotra says that the biggest reason behind arthritis is lack of physical exercise.	4.535720390875451

The lifestyle of working throughout the day in front of computer and lying in front of TV in the evening back at home is leading the most youngsters towards the arthritis.	4.664941145828023

Dr.Malhotra says that the problem escales in the winter because of reduction in physical activity in the winter.	5.692286388713444

In order to avoid such problems one can take help of jogging , biking.	4.252603510269569

Yes it could be so that in the winter season people do not prefer to come out in the winter season and remains hidden inside the houses , as a result of which it could happen that they come under the effect of germs.	5.185566920168628

But it could happen in any other season also.	8.175950418912551

In relation to the color of cough even some doctors believe that it is an identification or symbol of sinus.	4.815513948534343

While till today no proof or fact could have been produced in its favor.	4.8235623127998855

It could also not be proved that when antibodies begin to decrease because of the disease then green cough is its identification.	5.334409455138034

In a research conducted on three hundred patients two third of the patients believed that cough is formed because of drinking milk.	4.413289673455168

But it has not been proved scientifically.	8.069424264789763

According to the above study researchers have found that those patients who had viral fever , among them some voluntarily drank milk in large quantity.	3.797605449793046

Among the patients drinking milk neither cough was formed nor congestion occurred because of this.	4.310733151122553

It is believed that arthritis occurs by cracking fingers or any other part of body.	3.678165598540907

Till now it could not be proved in any research or case study.	5.529402496076142

While even this conception does not have even an iota of truthfulness.	6.536785412464173

The real thing is that the contraceptive pills should be taken at the regular time only then they become effective.	6.4151257755099405

In the west many people believe that singles have a better emotional and sex life in comparison to the married people while the results of the researches tell this conception as the opposite picture.	3.883371149849357

It is also half truth that going to the toilet daily is the symbol of clean stomach and if you are not going to the toilet daily then you have constipation or some other disease , but the studies tell that if a person goes to the toilet even three times in a week then he is considered healthy.	4.410215629138075

It is true that carrot has a large quantity of Vitamin - A which is a necessary nutrient for good eyesight.	4.761853686731828

But it should not be taken to mean that by this the strength of our eyes will increase to become like x - ray vision.	5.605501721704579

There is no direct relation of eating carrot with increase in the strength of the eyes as such.	6.739330369882061

Anyway ' fractional ablation ' of the skin is the latest technology.	6.941379404637983

In this the fresh skin comes out very soon while before this when ablative lasers were used then the fresh skin took time to come out.	3.481422139798524

Fractional laser suits the most for fine wrinkles and a special glow comes on skin by this.	4.508807428584031

In fact , triptopan phenailalanin and thyrocin named amino acids are found in excessive quantity.	4.829016419637845

These compounds full of nitrogen are not only a very important part for the proteins of the whole body like other amino acids , they also have one more special quality.	4.048805220062892

It is the ' precursor ' meaning previous form of adrenalin.	5.016454492278468

When you are stressful then this very hormone inspires you for action , in which neurotransmitter by the name of dopamine does the important job of sending signal to the nerve cell of the brain.	3.7343998019830025

The scientists claim that dopamine produces feeling for sex.	4.941880699720632

It means if your partner craves for chocolate then neuro chemical is responsible for this.	3.923030737451218

Now if we talk especially of lovers then chocolate helps in bringing hardness to the erection.	3.3573078825836578

The internal layer of the veins of the penis is called endothelium , which is responsible for producing nitric oxide.	4.313842926298806

This chemical makes the blood vessels wide and keeps them smooth from inside.	5.902004649526717

In this regard in a study done by the Greek and Swiss researchers when 10 gram of deep colored chocolate was given to 17 healthy men then a quick improvement began to come in their endothelial function.	3.544158676118148

Keep in mind , only that chocolate proves to be very effective in increasing the physical sex - activity in which the amount of coca is at least 70 to 80 percent.	4.897779768234303

White and milk chocolate proves to be unsuccessful in this matter.	5.815782333105564

Cardiologists have warned that those people should not use aspirin as a protection from diseases related to heart arteries.	5.276133681458143

Who do not have any problem related to the heart and who are healthy.	6.278576461387088

It was first proved on the scientific basis that if a person suffering from the heart arteries related disease takes aspirin daily then he can get help in evading heart attack and strokes.	4.463061551946648

But now specialists are giving the suggestion not to take it because it has the possibility of more danger than profit.	5.651221997923838

Since ancient times people have been predicting future on the basis of dreams.	4.740922125454345

But scientists are not unanimous on reasons behind having dreams and its results.	4.022807096185781

Some scientists opine that whatever we see in dreams are views encased in our unconscious mind.	4.108179736366981

While some scientists believe that dreams are the result of electrical activity taking place in our mind.	4.077076796824055

According to scientists dreams are not at all the basis of future and it has got very little proof till now that dreams affect health.	3.953268801157931

According to a recent study published in the journal of personality and social psychology people of different cultures believe that dreams do have some truth.	3.2591539688726607

Overall researchers have concluded only this that dreams can not predict the incidents to take place in the future , instead of this they do inspire us to think upon our daily life because people work in the same way as they think.	4.3483558304148655

The truth is that we know very little about dreams that we see and the results of these dreams , even though sleep and dreams give us the solution to our serious problems.	3.216892831110429

Dreams could be more frequent by the intake of some special kinds of medicines besides some medicines of the high blood pressure.	4.362178000441809

But those youngsters whose father now was suffering from the above problem , their young children had the danger of pimples only twice more.	4.541769099274008

According to the researchers as far as the family or genetic effect in producing pimples is concerned , ' x ' chromosome plays an important role in it.	3.608662688823294

Anyway , in the study besides the family history oily skin is also found to be mainly responsible for the pimples.	5.023692239266169

Banyan has a lot of medicinal value in the Ayurveda medication.	7.161056531188291

Because of this only it will help in stopping the causes that bring old age.	4.9596046770205815

It need not be said that because of the process of oxidation in the body the harmful free radicals are formed in the body because of which along with many diseases the body has to face many abnormal physical conditions like wrinkles , insomnia , untimely fall and greying of hairs , sweating , decrease in patience , being angry without reason , inability to take decision , reduction in sensitivity etc.	4.171826006048831

It is a common belief that more men are victims of sexual dysfunction.	5.752212830523257

While the truth is opposite to this.	5.808139716822816

Many studies have revealed that women become victim of sexual dysfunction more than men.	4.3635222543643915

While 31 percent men are the victims of sexual dysfunction , this rate in the women is 43 percent.	6.0492149105523705

This problem reaches in even worse situation in the elderly women.	5.794814239709747

According to the recent survey report done on 31 , 581 women , the problems of sex desire , excitement or orgasm is found in 44.6 percent women of the age of 45 to 64 years.	4.101379260976256

While in the women of 18 to 44 age group this figure was of 27.2 percent.	6.282639021749495

But because of depression now even younger women are coming under its influence.	5.064463759104921

The researchers Raj Chirmiya and Itai Bab of Hindu University of Jerusalem have found in their study that there is greater ' bone loss ' in younger women because of depression.	3.766653909731529

There is reduction in the ' mass ' of bones i.e.hardness because of which bones begin to become weak and that increases the danger of fracture.	4.60477529186029

This condition is called osteoporosis.	7.284949768851795

Osteoporosis is a common thing in the developed countries.	6.344393204167498

In this problem in some serious cases the person becomes completely paralysed and in some cases he can even die.	5.158973931339969

On analyzing the data from 23 projects of 8 countries the researchers have found that because of depression the danger of bone loss in women especially in young women is greater before the end of their period.	4.816234586730694

In this process along with paying attention to alcohol drinking by women , smoking etc it was also considered whether they were taking hormone therapy or not.	3.5679776371026133

The researchers could not know correctly what kind of connection migraine could have with the danger of breast cancer but it is certain that in both conditions women hormone estrogen has a role to play.	3.965430980439572

In order to reach this conclusion researchers observed such 2 , 775 men employees of Stockholm , who never had heart attack.	3.562831339921617

These employees were asked in what way do they fight the anger related to the work ?.	4.855320896574709

Do they express their anger or remain silent ?.	5.564711636377466

Does headache or stomach ache start after the anger ?.	6.510117022296858

Do they bring out the anger of office at the home ?.	5.513135624687734

These employees were also asked regarding their habit of intoxication - like intake of liquor and smoking , disease especially diabetes work pressure etc.	2.867622659831829

Besides this the blood pressure , body - mass index and cholesterol level of people involved in the study were also noted down.	3.504004588307068

The average age of all people included in the study was 41 years , when the study was started in between 1992 and 1995.	4.583675978860391

The conclusion of the study that ran till 2003 was that those men who were good at tackling the current situation , in comparison to them , those men who used to hide the anger they had twice more danger of heart attack or dieing by the heart disease.	3.7943221821738167

Not only the drugs like cocaine , LSD , heroin have bad impact on the mind , but the steroid containing medicines like prednison , dexamethalon and hydrocortisone given to treat other problems like asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , skin diseases and allergy also have a bad impact on the mind.	2.943483560057091

As a result , the problems related to common sense could occur in those taking these medicines.	4.69188377335831

Among these -- problem in concentration , lack of alertness , inability to recall what one has said and inability to retain some thing , incident etc in the memory etc could be included.	3.5542317124139595

In fact the effect of the above medicines could end completely.	5.10433630007403

As far as the women getting pregnant is concerned , they generally become pregnant just before ovaries are formed in only those 6 days when the membrane of their cervix remain transparent , flexible and sticky.	3.71776488442115

But scientists have till now not able to understand whether the time of sex is also a factor in the cases of successful pregnancy.	6.126200281592722

The tasty breakfast taken in the morning not only gives you energy throughout the day , along with it also puts control over the habit of overeating.	6.157053048449271

In reality our hunger is more satiated by eating in the morning in comparison to eating in the evening.	5.69414612875695

If we agree with some studies then in the elderly and those who wake up early , attentiveness , concentration , alertness and logical power is at its peak around the afternoon.	3.6930734511280794

Therefore those works which needs more mental exercise to get completed , do them in the morning and keep the lighter works for the evening.	4.043753270746634

Grass does not grow on the cement road.	7.698164074535501

According to Dr.Hanimann every person is born with a poison named ' Sora ' , which is capable of producing numerous kinds of eruptions in the skin.	3.5179920719311535

This very poison is the father of most of the diseases.	5.501114363371512

Nature wants to keep the internal organs disease - free by taking it out in the form of ' skin diseases ' but because of suppressing it with lotions etc several diseases like asthma occurs in the body.	5.312820587883234

In the treatment of all diseases there is a need to give medication while removing all these ills.	5.411371939075634

In all the situations all the diseases appear with one or the other symptoms.	6.9128647622142605

By giving medication on the basis of these symptoms only the patient becomes healthy in the complete sense.	5.5231683289751246

In homeopathy giving medicines only after completely examining all the symptoms of the patient from the top to toe is considered correct as per the rules.	4.969995850017577

He wants the treatment of his those problems only.	9.379584417523679

He is not the technical specialist.	10.471312652687764

He describes the symptoms of all his problems in his own way.	7.36126593429553

Decimal potency is called ' decimal potency ' in English.	7.289101396934066

If 30 or 200 or 1000 potency is written simply on some medicines then it should be understood that that medicine is made in centesimal tradition.	4.865571136196594

Centesimal potency is called ' centesimal potency ' in English.	7.197595357452279

Medicines are made in one more tradition which is not in common practice , only some doctors use them.	5.38560135101855

Those showing this potency express it by prefixing it with 0 .	6.0159218907345675

As in - 0.0 potency etc.	14.080472139353448

Dr.Ajay Mukherjee has made the statement that it is possible that there is no method of prevention of this situation but it has been seen in the past few years that if some changes are made in their lifestyle and food habits then life can be a bit better.	4.449508236559699

Despite this the reality is that the normal life that others are leading they happen to be miles away from them.	4.390477346473502

They are physically weak.	10.16172697990099

Therefore they become sensitive from even a little sports.	7.769531509609657

They have to go through every such situation through which elderly have to go through.	4.627629065664647

Meaning osteoporosis , arthritis , skin related diseases rather they need the help of others for every small task.	5.4996468605649715

They even need help to change clothes.	8.424153646704957

This has also been detected from a recent study that the children afflicted with progeria that die of ' atherosclerosis heart related disease ' their average age is 13 years.	4.460958978003425

However it has been seen traditionally that age of patients is on an average around 20 years.	5.372672811881225

As of now these children know everything , understand and they even know that their age is not very long and yet they try to lead their life in a way different from others.	4.289078178589145

Water therapy has a dominant position in the therapy - order of naturopathy.	5.372728625133173

According to the point of view of Louis Kuhne often the main cause of diseases in most people is the accumulation of stool in descending colon.	3.904430817049235

Currently the only naturopathic simple cure for cleansing or washing descending colon is enema.	4.474509405456944

Pain reduces at that very time or in a little time.	7.987779600372121

Without enema one can not imagine the therapy course of naturopathy.	6.151693492393658

Detoxification of descending colon through enema and diet - change these two are the main foundation pillars of natural therapy.	4.3815700795881565

A naturopath can start therapeutic work only through the means of enema - pot.	4.968973979226568

If there is only enema pot in the hands of therapists that travel in villages even then he can treat successfully in various situations.	4.723182426352622

Normally without a catheter use of enema can as such happen.	5.649524368984215

For children , elderly and weak patients there is convenience in getting up water through a catheter.	4.717306725220011

Otherwise there is possibility of nozzle coming out by the speed of water , gas or stool.	4.8201328013886595

If he is weak or of less life force then you should give him enema of 19 ° - 100 ° water.	5.268039945445928

Enema pot should normally be kept at a height of 2 to 3 feet.	5.7638323834682295

In a special situation when the intestines of a patient are weak , there is swelling , injury , ulcer or wound in intestines then one should keep enema pot at a maximum height of one foot and minimum half a foot.	4.577036697107432

By this water will reach intestines at a very low speed otherwise stomach starts aching with the speed of water.	3.9712663507297705

There is fear of shock reaching the soft walls inside the colon.	5.038082952635085

Before inserting nozzle of enema inside the anus some water should be first taken out of it.	5.744596277038048

The air filled inside the tube should come out.	6.281970370998702

You should apply oil on nozzle or catheter while giving enema.	4.941797382383775

So that it is able to enter anus easily.	9.637193770693994

So that no friction occurs in the inner skin.	9.731057157603223

By breathing deeply entrance of water inside is facilitated.	6.512461736316529

Water is pulled inside the intestines by deep breathing.	5.546920355377535

After enema water has gone inside by doing an action like bhastika moving stomach up and down water that has reached inside the intestines exits taking out stool.	3.8835052060290303

If there is inconvenience in stopping enema water then before taking enema itself give a hot - cold compress to stomach for 10 - 15 minutes.	3.889446554057641

By doing ordinary hot compress also there is help in expulsion of stool.	5.365164949651478

Enema water starts going inside with speed or water stays cold then sometimes there is stomach-ache.	4.743363232031325

At that time one should immediately stop water from entering inside.	6.084804526925199

One should allow water to enter slowly on stopping of pain.	5.588931314935325

To stop water you can press enema - tube with finger.	5.412986527724959

If there is a clip then it can be used.	6.523513673149461

If on doing this also there is pain in passage of water then water should be made to reach the intestines with less speed reducing the enema - pot height.	4.8939544782649

Pain reduces by this also.	10.07712178772954

Process of giving enema : -.	19.154415364186477

By making him lie still on his back - this method is comfortable for patient.	5.094030122388902

One should give enema to extremely weak patients only after making him lie still.	4.805512534111548

This condition is appropriate for diseases like typhoid , cholera.	6.265953942992343

By this there is no chance of any kind of shock reaching the intestines of patient which are already weak.	5.026399643340273

My making him lie down on right side : -.	7.356475331716244

This state is considered right for patients of moderate health.	5.945931942272797

While making the patient lie down one should keep in mind that right leg is straight and left one is slightly bent.	4.863790037911744

However right leg should also be kept loose not keeping it taut.	7.17459358353515

By this no pressure may be there on anus.	6.748157027807713

By doing this one can insert nozzle inside easily.	4.633988545255114

There is also ease in water going inside.	5.7864319233485055

Making him lie down on left side : -.	9.334366122611288

Enema is not given in this condition often.	13.363124804708804

When one needs to take water in less quantity and needs to clean only rectum and descending colon only then it is appropriate to give enema in this situation.	4.301227121861156

By giving enema this way enema water can be made to reach maximum only till the center of transverse colon.	4.407928293604635

One can not make it reach the ascending colon.	5.4387612856588925

It is impossible in this condition.	9.116999763952926

If taking one - one and a half pint water one needs to clean only the rectum then this condition can be considered adequate.	4.4164168010327485

One should not allow enema water to go beyond transverse colon in appendicitis.	4.016076324664585

One should not allow any kind of shock to reach wall of intestine.	4.702771022057346

This state is only appropriate.	9.528265515452603

Because water of enema can not go diagonal further than the descending colon.	5.515102061247188

Making one lie down upside down on the chest or on the stomach : -.	7.083643583402189

The man who has difficulty stopping water immediately has urge of defecation on taking water.	4.508433059720199

For this this situation causes a lot of benefit in stopping the water easily.	4.987684869941488

A patient had to take water in the toilet itself out of fear of expulsion of water.	5.460807781276001

He was given enema in this condition on the very first day and no difficulty occurred in stopping water.	5.144547583684993

Anyhow due to some reason if difficulty occurs in stopping water then water also stops by keeping the anus pressed with fingers.	4.9407095083385615

Bending the chest on knees : -.	12.305884311360513

Leaving a weak man for a healthy man taking enema in this situation is beneficial from many points of view.	5.617244638823465

Anus remains quite high as compared to intestine.	8.888048743933071

From this water may reach inside descending colon very easily.	5.153337190706557

Along with this on water filling up fully inside descending colon one does not need to make any kind of attempt to stop water because of location of anus being a little high.	3.9682506996833937

Water remains blocked automatically by it.	7.696609727939802

In this situation while taking enema one should keep a small soft pad underneath the knees.	4.925623659535569

By this patient will have no trouble in knees while taking enema.	6.070661051548667

For a healthy man whose stool has come into the rectum and one needs to use enema only to expel stool.	4.774417847537418

That stool comes out by one pint normal cold water.	6.7027283349258875

In this state there is no need to mix anything in the water.	5.580503244860854

Rectum gets stimulation by this.	10.508602535597197

The quantity of salt in in four pint water should be maximum two tolas and minimum one tola.	4.689470587796622

Brine has the property that descending colon is unable to absorb this water easily.	6.424235423726911

This water staying in intestine brings help in thinning and expelling stool.	4.9585790923109005

Mixing decoction of neem leaves : - this water is antiseptic.	7.593857862412571

The chemical property of neem is cool therefore it reduces the additional heat of colon.	4.275816051578159

Destroys the worms of colon.	14.542711216432481

Garlic being antiseptic and because of being acrid destroys germs.	7.787209497328096

Quantity of garlic becoming in excess by mistake or unknowingly burning sensation in eyes occurs.	4.830231194016039

Heat of body increases by this.	9.5892109072635

There remains a chance of distress to the patient.	7.479104011141581

Squeezing lemon juice : - Enema of this water helps in expelling gas.	6.871488245533262

You can use minimum one or maximum two lemons in four pint water.	4.017537356229205

There are two ways of mixing lemon in water.	4.570236155767477

While giving enema if some water one pint or half pint remains then you should add lemon juice in water.	5.003243598739311

This way by mixing a little juice in water urge to defecate begins strongly.	5.048855714766872

Lemon brings a lot of help in separating old stool from colon.	5.5559989166406885

Making the patient lie on right side one should give oil to patient through a syringe.	5.84612262043908

After that one may give water of enema as per requirement.	6.942665637794148

By making oil reach first smoothness comes in colon walls.	5.186504658373988

After this water on reaching gets rid of stool easily.	5.5755723371356405

When there is pain in stomach , because of staying in large quantity if old stool keeps pricking inside stomach , there is gas in stomach and stool - urine is obstructed then enema happens to be extremely useful.	4.6329894866146315

The patient in whose stomach enema water stops , is unable to come out easily , on usage oil by him also with the above mentioned method obstruction of water will reduce or not.	3.8673948749959353

By chance if water has stopped then because of entrance of oil in colon flatulence of colon will come out easily.	4.58938610977483

By this water will also try to come out because oil is a laxative substance.	5.429244767037212

Cause of passage of water inside not happening : -.	7.331573822504252

Sometimes while giving enema water does not enter colon.	7.355234951500513

It stays where it was in the enema pot.	4.6181593809764205

Its causes are : - Enema - Stool getting stuck on mouth of enema - nozzle and catheter.	4.51949310449472

Because of this water is unable to come out of mouth of nozzle and water stays stable where it was in the enema pot.	4.059861574681852

In this condition the part of nozzle or catheter which is inside the anus.	4.551511134129146

It should be moved up - down slowly.	6.694040828116736

The faeces that might be stuck on the mouth of the nozzle will be lost and water will start entering inside easily.	4.480045635360236

The other reason is presence of stiff pieces on the anus itself.	5.0815534989055005

The shape and type of this stool is also of such a type that it sits properly on the anal opening.	4.280454681513921

On such an occasion one should take out faeces breaking it inserting the fore finger inside the anus.	3.772086070492605

After this water of enema will be able to enter inside easily.	6.054623577562959

When stiff stool is full in the descending part from the descending colon then there is obstruction of stool and urine both.	5.296646520516788

On such an occasion one should make use enema of glycerine or any oil.	4.295695695458338

One may well not be able to make all the oil inside but on the entrance of even a little oil inside stimulus arises on anus from the contact of oil.	4.3765465795052165

From the pressure of this stimulus stool comes out.	6.644396613241213

On such an occasion descending colon expands a little on fomenting the stomach with hot water and stool also softens a little.	3.6948215409934053

By this there is facilitation of entrance of water inside.	4.996356547247565

In a specific situation where there is swelling in the uterus and more pressure is exerted by it on the rectum then also water does not enter inside.	5.157342452532305

While giving enema to an old woman even the catheter of enema did not enter straight inside , it used to get twisted going a little far.	3.8676411360371192

There was so much expansion and swelling in her uterus that from its pressure the walls of rectum had almost met each other.	4.35654880375345

Water entered inside only after this.	9.45199699497279

Enema of half to one pint of water : -.	7.529378243050501

Enema of such less water is beneficial to patient after a prolonged fast or in an extremely weak condition from other reasons.	5.060732789462345

By using water even a little more than requirement patient will feel fatigue or water produces gas , heaviness , restlessness and nervousness by stopping in the descending colon.	3.9156745702191085

When on entering the rectum stool strongly urges the patient to defecate.	6.263479637467899

If faeces is not coming out because of absence of strength of throwing faeces in intestines.	5.1698520763049745

Only then enema of such less water would be effective.	5.54572327451745

In such a condition how much water should one take , its decision should be made in this manner.	4.484158572865348

Filling up one or one and a half pint water in box of enema one should start taking enema as prescribed.	4.34778411037813

On entrance of water in rectum the urge to defecate will gradually increase.	6.091849057782299

When urge to defecate increases so much that one can not stop its pressure then immediately stopping water of enema from going inside giving the patient a pot for defecation you should induce him to defecate.	4.15587347284631

You should make one defecate only on making him lie down on a bed pan or rubber cloth.	3.5726449924954777

There is convenience in sitting and defecating only in presence of energy or agility for sitting.	4.646292016081428

When rectum bloats on filling up more than necessary then its pressure is exerted on the urinary bladder.	4.3798329842170505

Rectum and urinary bladder have an inverse relationship.	7.586609676949711

During the aforementioned obstruction use of oily water enema is the best remedy.	5.878495531059595

There is a possibility of delay from enema of plain water.	4.006254606571207

Because of lubrication of oil stool comes out easily.	5.888610294166652

Because of extreme constipation many small - large lumps form.	6.073550270298735

During this time one should keep taking catheter or nozzle completely out of anus intermittently so that lump comes out with water.	4.595532293109684

Sometimes lumps of weak patient stop anus.	7.2310747579408385

At that time entrance of water also becomes impossible.	6.745322460775915

At such an occasion one should give enema only after taking stool out with the help of fingers.	5.242106663444667

After entrance of water of enema in stomach of patient of extreme constipation stool starts coming out extremely fast.	6.749385405065053

Taking patient to the toilet or making him lie down in a bed pan also becomes impossible and stool keeps coming out in between even after trying.	4.704893390866936

Therefore one should give enema to patient with faeces - urine obstruction making him lie down on a rubber sheet.	4.233128505011839

In presence of strength one should give patient enema bending him on his knee - chest or making him lie down flat on the back.	4.010220514339565

For vaginal irrigation all other devices except nozzle are for enema only.	4.907641396482826

Nozzle of vaginal irrigation nozzle is slightly long and turned in a circular shape and its head is a bit round.	4.955311987319947

There are 9 - 10 tiny holes in it.	8.032310488882556

From it water of douche entering inside like a fountain cleans everything coming in contact with all parts.	4.460504599330688

Because of mucous membrane of vagina being extremely sensitive one should clean it with a fountain nozzle.	4.939536140082592

Cot like an enema cot of vaginal irrigation may be 4 - 6 inches long like a leg.	4.9822039681209604

There should be a round hole in the center of the cot of 9 inch or 1 foot diameter.	3.939628215904131

So that water of vaginal irrigation falls only in the pots and pans kept underneath that round hole.	4.549180614458221

It is necessary to take enema before vaginal irrigation so that pressure of stool obstructed in the rectum does not fall on uterus.	3.9244289470788085

One should use neem leaf for vaginal irrigation.	5.657702533632559

To clean the uterus from inside there is convenience in releasing dirt with lukewarm water of neem leaf.	4.360434592758427

Normally water of vaginal irrigation should not be hotter than 180 - 1000 Fahrenheit.	7.584523809335443

On occurrence of swelling or pain in uterus one should bring in use 1020 - 1030 Fahrenheit slightly hot water.	4.518349687761283

If there are blisters , injuries and burning sensation inside the uterus then one should give vaginal irrigation of cold water of neem leaf.	4.600918491874566

One should use lukewarm water in absence of burning sensation.	6.458976814319424

Normally after giving vaginal irrigation of hot or lukewarm water one should give vaginal irrigation of pure cold water.	4.098981293779262

By this from increase in blood circulation there strength in produced in nerves.	6.092874066073934

To remove uterus related diseases local blood circulation is necessary.	5.850910639498403

There is benefit from vaginal irrigation in swelling of uterus , tumor on the mouth or inside uterus , blisters or injuries , menstrual irregularity , excess or deficiency , white or yellow discharge , etc diseases.	3.624704105280977

Cold vaginal irrigation is appropriate for muscular weakness and unnatural heat of body.	4.964778637110282

When should you avoid enema.	8.255773949967404

Some people think that by going on taking enema for a long time in indisposed condition one develops the habit of enema ending the natural strength of intestines to expel stool.	3.6606770689516352

Experience has it that until there is no strength in intestines to expel stool out and one does not have an appetite because of that or starts decreasing.	5.577433900062032

Or other problems restlessness , nervousness , etc occur then enema is beneficial from the point of view of bringing help to the task of intestines.	4.159032896940179

If excretion does not happen despite a strong urge to defecate and because of it if an unfavourable effect takes place on disposition and health then one should take enema.	4.997502194991208

Otherwise in the deficiency of stool - removal - strength ready stool starts drying up in the rectum.	5.867635281256405

Sometimes its shape even starts increasing.	8.36036385256284

In such a condition during excretion fear of bleeding from occurrence of injury in anus remains.	5.002957938619177

One should stool of patient of piles dry up.	8.111550488929387

From this there is occurrence of extreme pain because of warts and weakness increases.	6.622928774447878

Even in the absence of urge to defecate if there is no other problem or consequence of it on appetite then in that condition there is no harm in waiting for excretion thrice or from twelve to twenty - four hours.	4.036621988743435

The purpose is that as much as possible one should avoid the situation of taking enema.	5.052062102377109

Patients may need to take enema everyday for one - two months or for a long time during less food intake , fast , दुग्धकल्प or other conditions.	5.360476531239621

During the days of less food or fasting stool does not come out because of adequate pressure.	4.480141332660119

By increasing diet in this condition loose motions start taking place.	6.527258525000932

If patient or a healthy person is not having a specific problem because of defecation not taking place then there is no need to worry.	4.4859059299600395

Its cure is not enema.	8.933597315836222

The right cure is this only that suitable changes are made in diet.	5.050236958507508

As much as possible one should try to prevent enema.	4.702782085678192

Only after exhausting other remedies one should be inclined for taking enema.	4.668890640177052

According to natural therapy ideally one should start a lumber bath in hot water tub and end in cold water.	4.28436836025507

From a hot lumbar bath all parts of abdomen become soft getting hot.	4.926763416861068

Later when that part is immersed in cold water.	6.385758234103247

Then the pores and blood vessels of that part constrict and the blood pressure that has come up goes towards the inner side.	6.565225240790875

Because of physical impurity blood distribution is unable to take place properly in the fine capillaries of upper and inner part of body.	4.183837905345678

In that condition lumbar bath helps.	7.880710748955626

The pores that are immersed in water also assist in expelling dirt becoming active through innumerable holes in the form of sweat.	4.53231575912778

In all these diseases obstruction of urine , uterine disorders , small - descending colon , urinary bladder , swelling in kidney , pain , inactivity there is benefit from hot - cold lumbar bath.	3.928875417921788

Use of this bath is also beneficial in diseases of stones.	6.74916970542528

In disease of lungs like tuberculosis , asthma , cold , cough , pleurisy , etc chest wrap is the best.	4.310329555712237

Along with a detoxifying diet giving a chest wrap in the main therapy in above mentioned diseases.	4.199829480296627

Heart wrap is given to patients that have palpitation.	8.17776668145613

Hot - cold fomentation on chest : -.	11.100493027066932

In asthma , cold , cough , pleurisy , gases , pain and heaviness in the place of heart , etc diseases cogestion there is removed by hot - cold fomentation.	4.379119575974877

You should increase or decrease the measure of hot - cold compress according to the life - force of patient.	5.608864867132886

It is significant that more than 40000 deaths occur worldwide with dengue fever.	2.454377538482998

University of Queensland and team of researchers have found that lifespan of mosquitoes that spread dengue can be reduced by infecting with a bacteria ' wolbachia '.	2.0352055380671903

Head researcher Scott has said in a study published in a prominent journal of the science world ' Sale ' that by this chances of mosquitoes infecting humans will diminish.	1.9797768085661926

They have said that under this startling progress they found that ' wolbachia ' infected mosquitoes have resistance from pathogens that spread other diseases including dengue , chikungunya and malaria.	1.714742839507357

Researcher said that it means that the mainly proposed process of dengue control can be much more effective as compared to before and it can be applied to many other diseases in future.	2.243748388542975

Your stomach is naturally in the shape of your closed fist.	6.026921316795358

As a single muscle it expands and contracts according to use.	4.956933551477105

When it is full it expands.	7.21826476053946

When it is empty it returns towards its initial shape.	4.824173188297253

It is a daily routine in which there is nothing new.	7.399007919620524

Although when you develop the habit of eating a lot of food then muscles of stomach lose their natural flexibility and size of stomach actually starts increasing hence more than necessary food increases the size of stomach.	4.435027213564051

It is somewhat like this : If stomach is small then you will feel it to be full soon.	6.125503768263581

In people with big stomach nerves of stomach do not allow brain to suspect fulfilment until food is available in large amount hence people with a large stomach need more food to feel full which is way more than their need.	3.9780577029126225

Some obesity specialists believe that in two to four weeks after eating more than necessary size of stomach starts expanding.	5.596941807443568

Along with this itself the quantity of food that makes you feel fulfilment also reduces.	5.8229776210023205

People who diet think that by leaving food they can reduce calories.	5.412636259288188

On not having breakfast your metabolism does not start until lunch.	5.2541885609531285

It means that you lose 3 - 4 hours of reducing fats.	5.99906606789493

Remember that you stay hungry your metabolism slows down hence eat healthy fat free food and your metabolism will reduce accumulated fat.	3.859645188458754

You stomach can contract or expand even after one meal.	5.9765251400239965

It depends on the amount of food.	10.068165493474938

When you eat a little every 2 - 3 hours and do not eat more than necessary then your stomach slowly starts contracting on its own.	4.4595122404948295

Research shows that instead of eating 3 big meals one can reduce the size of stomach by 33 percent by eating 5 - 6 small meals.	4.7439439984178575

According to Pennsylvania State University survey the bigger the serving size is the more you eat.	4.032235937491607

Gradually reduce the portion of your meal.	7.748094453327165

When these portions reduce steeply then stomach stays a little hungry and sends signals of hunger to the brain.	3.8953997420537734

If portions of food are reduced slowly then stomach contracts without any problem.	5.710242952580787

Order for a small plate or eat with someone else.	6.822372825424227

You will feel satisfaction.	9.804530103755727

Remember that pleasure of one bite can also be just as fulfilling as swallowing a glass full of ice cream hastily.	4.398887274027669

Your stomach , mouth and mind are all connected to each other and after chewing for 20 minutes your stomach sends this signal to the brain that you have become satisfied.	4.638713974075222

To reduce weight satisfactorily and successfully you will have to eat slowly for 20 minutes or more.	5.102019900602546

One way is that you keep the spoon or fork down after every bite.	5.674473206279554

Enjoy the bite and pick up the spoon again only after you have swallowed the whole bite.	4.340367301565216

Stomach gets full soon from the food which is full of enough amount of fiber like chapatti , whole pulses , salad , etc.	4.841720034973784

Negative feelings like fear , depression , anxiety , remorse and anger urge to eat more.	4.947242864153535

In recent years bypass surgery is getting popular in the East.	5.656102190241641

This surgery converts the capacity of stomach to the size of a glass smaller than a bottle and detoxifies the small intestine.	4.3735757344311486

Within a year patients lose more than 60 percent of their weight.	6.070201925874556

Specialists warn that gastric bypass is a big surgery which should not be taken lightly.	6.305021878129919

In 15 percent cases operation becomes unsuccessful.	7.702924063685011

In 7 percent cases blood clot in lungs , pneumonia , infection , leakage from repaired intestinal passage , etc complications occur.	3.8531949372491554

In out of 100 cases death may occur.	6.654004870970546

Doctors advice for gastric surgery only in those cases where obesity is a big problem.	5.773605851105055

During sleep only repair of bones and muscles inside body is possible.	5.3854763550265945

Hence it is important that you sleep well so that you do not have to face any kind of problem.	4.574290314370158

In sleep not getting complete or in lack of sleep chance of accident while driving increases.	4.413471065879413

Do not drive on its occurrence.	8.51258935367033

Lack of a good sleep becomes a cause of metabolic diseases and hormonal disorder.	6.15280918678209

It is remarkable that by waking up recurrently secretion of hormones get affected.	4.693335842653657

Prevent these : - Tea - coffee at night and alcohol in large amount.	6.168785531803421

In the context of joints operations of knees and hips are mainly taken into account.	4.162636957640725

In the place of deformed hips and joints joint replacement is a successful and safe surgery.	4.649717941085122

It is true that in winters joints pain is too much.	5.354136763296546

As long as joints are concerned one can do surgery of deformed knees and hips in any season.	4.276631086752792

This because now all standards of facilities have changed.	5.876287420474384

Now surgery happens in a completely air conditioned operation theater.	5.997287787185113

Rooms are also air conditioned.	13.67947373691335

Hence one can get successful joints related surgery done in months of January or June too.	4.711884387804806

No matter which season there is no effect on the process of operation.	7.684765242490968

Besides all this one aspect of truth is also that injuries heal in the winter season much too fast as compared to the summer season.	4.245556156671288

As compared to summer situations of occurrence of infection also decrease in winters.	5.400333990807924

So one also has to give less medicines to the patient and patients too get better too soon.	6.121373062734265

In summers there is more use of antibiotics and patient also has to take more precautions.	7.010946707491957

Anorexia Nervosa is a disease occurring often in adolescent girls.	6.7120532692614825

Exercising is my hobby.	14.026813908866758

This is the very reason that I exercise as soon as I wake up.	4.201004512533808

Not only your body but your mind also becomes strong from regular exercise and you can handle yourself even in a difficult situation.	4.718355197770617

By going on taking the required amount of ' Rub - i - anar ' 2 - 3 times a day excess thirst , weakness of liver , complaints of eating mud or coal get away.	3.6589018763231875

The total mount of iron in body is 4 - 5 grams.	5.741757239082828

In this about 70 % iron is coupled with hemoglobin in red blood cells.	4.474709881354611

About 20 - 23 % iron is stored in various tissues in the form of ferretin and hemosiderin.	4.8817550638891545

One finds the problem of iron deficiency in about half the population of the world.	5.477482380621642

It has become known from researches that more than half men and two - third women in our country are afflicted with anemia.	2.857383044132623

Tissues get damaged from excess of iron also , even death can occur.	4.110173220691577

An adult needs 1 mg of iron everyday.	7.485476523787501

Iron is in abundance in eggs , fish.	4.337062435132103

We call this iron ' haem iron '.	6.109004680177188

Its absorption from intestines is about 10 % whereas iron is also present in green leafy vegetables , cereals , pulses , their absorption by intestines happens with less ease.	3.348209368531216

So possibility of iron deficiency in vegetarians is more.	6.332179771579612

Amount of iron in body being less its absorption by intestines increases whereas being more it decreases.	4.661280386503482

If absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful , it is insoluble and is unable to be used in body.	3.013994140686196

In blood iron remains attached to protein Transferrin.	5.306591850221355

98 % is used in bone marrow , red blood cells for production of hemoglobin.	7.0611138339126445

It enters cells through blood and stays attached to ferretin protein in cells , in this form iron is soluble and less harmful.	3.598597050186551

Body can use them on occurrence necessity.	8.935378042726045

If amount of ferretin increases in cells then it converts to insoluble hemosidrine which can be harmful for body.	3.7140626379911006

About one gram iron in body is stored mainly in liver cells and macrophage.	3.9347756282283726

On occurrence of necessity of iron stored in body body uses it.	4.140338070277593

One can detect the excess or deficiency of iron from blood iron level , transferrin and ferretin in body.	3.8961338710245172

Deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in sufficient amount in food , absorption of iron present in vegetarian food happens with less ease , so possibility of deficiency is more.	3.0017069729528427

Requirement of iron increases in childhood , youth , pregnancy.	6.7011011403818275

So if it is not consumed in additional amount then there may be deficiency.	5.912986110503021

Because of less absorption of iron in old age possibility of occurrence of anemia can increase.	5.176005755134301

If iron comes out of body with blood by bleeding even then deficiency of iron occurs in body.	4.875480290697114

Deficiency of iron also occurs by occurrence of infection of blood sucking hookworms in intestines , excessive bleeding during periods in women , bleeding from intestines or other parts of body.	3.8797359683054746

In the poverty line special danger of iron deficiency remains in children , women , elderly people that do not drink milk.	3.9936456018752273

In the second trimester of pregnancy somewhat all women become victims of iron deficiency.	2.535197152050507

In the second trimester of pregnancy somewhat all women become victims of iron deficiency.	2.535197152050507

If iron pills  capsules are consumed for a long time in a large amount or more iron reaches inside body from other reasons then it starts accumulating in the various body parts of body specially liver , muscles of heart , endocrinal glands.	3.789537869505401

By which tissues get damaged.	9.253632814411276

Tissues get damaged by the effect of active free radical being produced because of excess of iron.	4.843594933107613

When more blood needs to be put up at regular intervals because of thalassemia , sickle cell anemia , etc then iron starts accumulating in body in a larger amount.	4.031878225525367

In some individuals absorption of iron from intestines happens in excessive amount because of which there may be excess of iron in body.	4.208324027944037

This disease is often hereditary because of abnormality in genes.	4.876725061891484

We call this disease ' Haemosiderosis '.	7.149365661767141

On entrance of iron in large amount in body spots occur on skin.	5.962898195564837

Diabetes can occur from pancreas getting damaged.	6.8942332483410365

Cirrhosis may occur from damaged liver , danger of liver cancer increases.	5.401262767345024

The seminal vesicles of men may get destroyed.	3.3983226649424547

Weakness , fatigue occurs , can become impotent , weight decreases , swelling and pain occurs in joints , nausea , vertigo occur.	3.4890534876827553

Size of liver may increase , hair falls , abdominal fluid retention may occur , Heart diseases may occur.	4.631657280300366

Test of excess of iron can be measure of transferrin , ferretin levels , biopsy of liver.	4.043065353283796

Iron being in excess can be fatal , hence to expel it from body injections of ferrol are given regularly.	3.1590321509098636

This treatment is difficult and extremely expensive.	5.4330466655128005

Now medicine that makes iron from body ineffective which can also be eaten in the form of a capsule has been developed.	4.052571856364149

Hopefully it will soon be available in our country as well.	4.709053026820923

In patients of hereditary homosiderosis 450 ml blood is taken out every week so that there may be no excess of iron.	3.7918861461060622

By this treatment there remains no chance of death from their heart , liver diseases.	5.64580660717451

Nowadays one hears it said often that so and so person has got allergy.	4.489790568932271

The more the use of modern synthetic medicines is increasing the more outbreak of allergy is going on increasing.	3.199705038697111

Diseases have been mentioned in ayurveda by the names of Sheetpitta , Udard and Kotha.They are included in allergies of today.	4.033620126093444

Allergy or sheetapitta is a reaction of body which is produced by touching or eating those substances that are unfavourable to the constitution of people.	4.396825117590148

Being favourable to the constitution is called shastra - satmya and unfavourable is called asatmya.	4.059517061877245

Some people get an allergy from wearing clothes made of synthetic thread.	4.47749471634687

These people develop symptoms of allergy from consumption of some special English medicines , breathing speed increases.	5.105692589028254

Nerve becomes weak and even death occurs from shock and nervousness.	5.223363575638249

These medicines becoming asatmya can also become marak  deadly for people.	5.315076433373435

Those who get an attack of sheetpitta or allergy should immediately use medicine.If they themselves do not succeed in arrangements then they without losing time they should send in a good hospital or doctor.	3.257545992848463

That ayurvedic medicines also benefit less in them is not the case.	6.971432039785816

Not feeling sleepy or feeling less sleepy is surely a disease but feeling too sleepy is also a disease , it has been called ' insomnia '.	2.832566706751959

Many people stay afflicted with insomnia.	7.084368035849251

A new research of AIIMS has claimed that after donating kidney donor women remain happier as compared to such men.	4.446499960586664

The Associate Professor of Department of Surgical Disciplines of AIIMS Sandeep Guleria has said that after donating kidney he wanted to do an assessment of level QOL of life of donor.	3.467914350450297

We found that after donating kidney a considerable improvement came in the QOL of donor.	4.494729151145921

Prof.Guleria said that out of these too more improvement came in QOL of women donors as compared to men donors , especially in the QOL of mothers and wives.	4.110892034890861

Out of these many were married , many unmarried , some living in live - in relationships , some married but divorced or windowed.	3.3242587877481715

Since possibility of donation of kidney of mothers and wives is more hence we wanted to know that the reason of kidney donation of other women is love or they are compelled to do so.	3.856978634316113

Guleria has told that for doing so we did a survey with the medium of a questionnaire.	4.8942363369103505

In which research of physical and mental health and social acceptance of donor was done.	4.689051618950995

A total of 126 donors were included in this research in which 73 % were women.	5.994503123843747

They said that we asked them a lot of questions.	8.11270758213899

Guleria has told that they were asked that after donating kidney are they enjoying their life , do they have enough money to fulfil their needs and are they completely satisfied with their personal and physical relationships.	3.3460151002381195

The number of donor women is a lot but mothers and wives looked more satisfied after donating their kidney.	4.9553777843979745

After hypnobirth , water birth , aroma therapy , reflexology and scientology methods of labor pain relief now trend of epidural anaesthesia is growing rapidly.	3.58832867475184

The reason for it is that where one gets some relief from pain in other methods there itself a mother stays 100 percent free from pain even in consciousness.	4.158840826649589

Given benefits and demand of this technique not only is its experiment being used in all big hospitals but recently it has been started in AIIMS as well.	4.861135081244763

Doctors have to say that despite awareness being less nowadays about 25 % women ask for such methods.	4.375674924485074

Senior gynaecologist Dr.Asha Sharma of Rockland Hospital says that the most important path of pain signal is the backbone.	4.653728291629109

Anaesthetics stop this signal in the backbones even before it reaches the brain.	5.412874947884341

In routine anaesthesia the injection is given directly in the spinal cord by which patient faints.	5.878069560983465

But in epidural injection is applied in such a canal of the lower part of spinal cord that patient does get pain relief but her and the foetus both remain fully conscious and are also able to move hands feet.	4.194508805088688

During the delivery anesthetic keep talking to the woman.	5.730848487472859

However during delivery woman is unable to apply pressure on the lower part.	9.424634476002215

Dr.Sharma says that if epidural anaesthesia is given at the right time with the help of an expert anesthetic then this method is completely safe.	4.9300945087717025

They start given anaesthesia when cervix has open 2 to 4 centimetres.	5.131247401003905

Former Head gynaecologist department of G.B.Pant Hospital Dr.Neera Agarwal says that this method is new for this place but it is being used in foreign countries for many years.	4.257131699077042

This facility should start in all government hospitals because an expenditure of just till three thousand more occurs in it.	3.9856858680304312

But due to lack of resources related to anaesthesia and operation theater this is unable to start.	5.0307446446383945

Dr.Agarwal says that there may be some risk in a condition of not getting the epidural anaesthesia in the right way at the right time.	5.5343433033749125

Meaning , blood pressure of woman reducing suddenly.By this heartbeat of foetus may slow down for a little while.	4.233521897408245

In some people symptoms of acute headache , breathing problem , head reeling on getting up may also occur.	4.000657921084707

In a condition of getting anaesthesia in the wrong canal the complete lower half of patient may get paralysed and there may be danger to the child in such a condition.	4.781423405926065

Because of which our mind and life get influenced and often we end up doing harm to ourselves with our own hands.	3.730951080212946

Not being able to cry or for not being to cry openly we produce so much pent up energy inside us that we do not even hesitate to commit suicide.	3.8292611467034408

Therefore whenever tears come by any excuse allow them to come.	5.310430658735674

Its first use was done for malnourished children and infected women , which was successful.	4.747010466436826

During this time this came to be known that Spirulina is also helpful in the diagnosis of other diseases.	4.613950008557148

The researchers worldwide proved this that Spirulina is also effective in pancreas related , thyroid , hepatitis , cholesterol , diabetes , arthritis and night blindness.	3.5849703246160782

In the Africa continent Spirulina has been proven successful in fighting with malnutrition of children in plentiful.	4.345159227838293

These are some special kinds of weed found in lakes , which by meeting in.	4.551203770372838

Spirulina spreads on the surface of the water of the Ramgarh and Jalmahal lake of Rajasthan by October month.	4.403797933940621

According to ' World Social Report - 2010 ' in the backward classes of India 54 percent children are weigh less.	3.944299498080037

According to the report 83 children in every thousand become victims of death at birth only and 119 children become by the time they are 5 years of age.	3.988195223777857

The major reason behind this has been considered to be the lack of blood in the bodies of mothers and malnutrition.	5.410041714043037

Spirulina has been found capable of fighting with situations these days only.	6.329763499168432

It has also been found useful in cancer and HIV prevention.	5.656241711175873

The youth must not remain in this that only aging people can get heart attacks.	6.0870954480580295

Statistics and research done by experts show that among people coming in the grip of heart attack now the number of youth less than 40 years is increasing rapidly.	5.615955240749377

Saif Ali Khan had to be admitted to the hospital some time back owing to a problem related to heart , then the severe heart attack of fashion designer Rohit Bal.	4.061631428675889

The signal is clear that the youth is rapidly moving towards heart related problems.	4.920898732866542

A big reason for this is their bad lifestyle.	6.89345438696618

A study done by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS is enough to shock.	4.304908026055533

The study shows that the rate high blood pressure , obesity and heart related diseases in the youth is increasing rapidly.	5.503624722890341

Especially the youth living in the cities are coming fast in its grip.	5.480933099785273

According to doctors the fast lifestyle of the youth living in cities , fatty food and the increasing use of alcohol is responsible for this because of which the matter of obesity , high blood pressure and diabetes is increasing among the youth.	4.533023747341399

Research shows that in such cases the condition of the metropolitan youth is alarming.	5.688345654639361

Complete it.	6.864837401292388

According to the study of the World Health Organization the most heart patients in the country are in Delhi after Kerala.	4.723288163485107

In these people of middle class are more.	6.337486677345371

Till ten - twelve years before people used to think this that the problem of heart disease i.e.blockage in the arteries of the heart is less in India in comparison to the whole world.	5.362554385601137

But in various studies and researches this is known that in comparison to the Western countries 2 - 3 percent of people in India are afflicted with heart disease.	5.056603729099437

Without doubt this is a matter of grave importance.	7.199340799079006

Before where the possibility of heart disease between 30 to 40 years of age was sketched , today this possibility has reduced and is found in people of 20 years of age and less.	5.5026679352040615

The heart diseases which happen to people in America at the age of 40 - 50 , they begin among the people here 10 years before.	5.03900536049832

There are many reasons of this.	5.409158749178053

Today , in the country in less than 40 years of age the problem of heart disease is increasing rapidly.	5.890915644052638

This rate is seen increasing rapidly towards youth of 20 years.	5.976595003248986

It is obvious the biggest reason of this is only and only the fast changing lifestyle.	5.7411503308170415

In reality the rate of coronary heart related disease in Indians especially in the youth , has begun to be found to be almost three times more in comparison to western countries.	4.375471616247084

Today the craze of smoking can be seen to be in many of the youth.	6.256115867134562

In the form of a base the bad effects of smoking have been recorded not only in India but on the international level also.	4.752367667258552

According to the WHO nearly 1.1.billion people in the world smoke , in which one third are of the age of 16.	5.505620899921813

Dr.Trehan says in the matter of the ill effects of smoking , professional people smoke because they feel that by this their tension will dissipate , but they ignore that fact , by which has come forward that this gives a bad effect on their health.	3.6771852665582503

There are harmful things like nicotine and tar in cigarettes and carbon monoxide is enough for destroying the heart.	4.15205960810386

Normally in our country fried food is consumed in which cholesterol and carbohydrates are more.	5.407815124646497

In things like pakora , jalebi , samosa these elements are found more.	6.070983591481423

Actually our food habits are proheart disease.	7.684464938887515

Low Density Cholesterol meaning LDC is also the result of deteriorating habits of food.	5.792707919410943

Because of these habits only the cholesterol deposited in the veins start making them narrow.	4.499250840738224

As a result , by this the supply of blood received by the heart gets affected and the possibilities of heart attack take hold.	5.1729748371210365

It is not difficult to control the increasing heart diseases on the youth and children.	4.635203204655724

Only some things need to be kept in mind.	6.84616772097083

Everyday for 45 minutes do a brisk walk i.e.walk fast.	5.174655478785705

Keep a control on the diet.	10.111939415480581

Use such an oil in food which does not solidify.	8.300150980175639

There comes a restriction in the flow of blood by it solidifying in the veins.	5.726227793710206

There is less cholesterol in olive oil or saffola.	6.141428394969078

One can see the physical exertion getting less in city people.	5.099155737412057

Most people go in cars.	9.698323880562103

Lifts are provided in buildings.	12.977988013782642

Walking on foot is almost not present.	8.359125113303305

They see it in the form of gas production or some other problem , but for knowing this that there is no problem coming , this can be understood in three forms.	5.254916472300741

In step - 1 the beginning of the heart disease has started , but the patient has not known.	7.763014830541037

There was no harm to the patient also.	10.718876563635982

In step - 2 there is some chagrin while doing some work , anger comes or feel some pressure or burning on the chest on running , then it can be Angina.	4.620371679040638

When you feel such symptoms then get warned and get a check up done immediately.	4.0090307754228585

Step - 3 is the most dangerous and comes forward in the form of heart attack.	8.112060950282295

In this the patient does not only know that there was the reason of Angina or on knowing also he had ignored it.	5.3731668109808775

In such cases the danger of heart attacks increases 20 percent in which the life of the person may be lost.	6.208007431267355

In these 10 percent of the matters are not able to reach the hospital even.	6.493036309726421

That is why one must remain very careful.	5.447657939601853

No symptom of enzyma appears in the patients of diabetes.	6.389434174904481

No warning is received from the side of the body.	6.575172669115798

Their nerves become numb because of diabetes.	6.806235154697573

Such people must always get their check up done.	5.0263933069666935

In such youth whose parents have had problems of the heart in them the possibility of these problems emerging in small age can remain.	5.226310523909016

Meaning if its fear has been expressed on medical basis after the age of 30 then such people may have this problem in the age of 20 also.	5.5318164262283664

If one person has problems like cholesterol , blood pressure and diabetes then he comes in the high risk category.	5.307348994380766

It is dangerous to have good cholesterol less than 50 and bad cholesterol more than 100.	4.894134004212865

Such people who smoke cigarettes more then become more careful.	5.950702468009712

Because of thickness coming in the blood also due to clots depositing problems increase in the heart.	6.659882473572495

Because of deteriorated lifestyle people become stressed and for getting instant relief from tension take the support of smoking and alcohol.	4.247822484324013

After the blood pressure getting haywire gradually heart related diseases take birth and one does not get to know.	5.795750667268338

In depression the person feels like eating again and again because of which excess fat starts depositing in the body and the danger of heart attack increases.	5.092590048089829

These people who are habituated to eating western food and drinks they should get their check up done because there is more sugar and salt in western food , by which flab increases.	4.732787784123715

After menopause the danger of heart attack emerges , because the veins of the heart remain fit because of the estrogens hormones secreted by the ovaries , that is why women have more danger after the age of 50.	4.738863483364631

Therefore after the age of 50 get regular check ups done.	7.0067603695024205

Specialists related with the diseases of the heart say that along with keeping the food habits better one should get the habit of regular exercise.	6.270714802427159

If there has been a history in the family of heart related diseases then one should get checked in three or six months.	5.4226060661296875

Anyway in the lifestyle of today people of 40 up should get a check done on the display of any such symptoms.	4.916911379542772

ECG Electrocardiogram : - ECG is the safest test method.	7.418218214033203

In actuality heart disease specialists keep an eye on the proper functioning of the heart on its basis.	4.889159450058316

TMT Tread Mill Test : - When enough is not understood about coronary heart disease by ECG then TMT test is done.	4.104319623198222

Eco cardiogram : - For measuring the speed of the beats of the heart this check is done.	5.695746058511754

In these two other types of tests are also done.	5.19588918258576

Transesophageal echocardiogram TEE : - In this test the pipe going from the neck to the stomach is tested because this pipe passes close to the heart.	4.889535419458992

This check is done on the coming of the need of any surgical treatment.	6.753004033444034

Stress Ecocardiogram : - By this test heart wall and its pumping work is seen.	4.878403891883299

This test is done immediately before and after exercise.	6.552157478123012

Angiography : - By the medium of this test the percentage of blockage is found.	7.462120590087151

Doctors have to say that there is some risk in this test and it is a little more expensive also.	6.90141784632443

The people for whom the situation of angioplasty or bypass surgery arises , they are asked to do this test frequently.	4.404536859653614

There is a check for this also.	6.614738139992612

In this order there is another test which is called homocysteine test.	6.055595222831655

Its level must be from 0 to 5.	9.214504690171237

In this only there is a test LPA.	10.66806048953581

In these tablets of nicotine are given.	6.954968759870497

Apart from this the doctor also does the check of sugar level , BP etc.	4.654956952548826

According to doctors there is a direct relation of the rise and fall of sugar and blood pressure with diseases.	5.177818344305568

Many fears remain in the mind about the bypass surgery used in the treatment of heart diseases.	5.483709598148906

What is this after all ? 	11.077214241564441

According to doctors heart fails due to the disfunctioning of the heart valve , blood pressure increase , increase of muscles of the heart and by weakening of the heart.	5.418377069431424

If there is treatment on time then one can be saved.	6.546716979772457

The blockage in the vein of the heart coronary artery is called coronary artery disease CAD.	5.641600255317449

This blockage is due to the deposition of fat , by which the vein becomes hard.	6.799772148306999

رگو ں کے پوری طرح بند ہونے میں دل کا دورہ پڑنے کا خطرہ بڑھ جاتا ہے۔ 	12.177669728519989

Of the three major veins of the heart barriers can be formed in any one or all.	5.787431945658799

In such situation in the operation a vein is taken out from any part of the body and connected to the vein of the heart.	4.795963873523373

This newly connected nerve starts blood flow automatically in the vein.	5.70454199730473

Many people feel that sick veins are taken out and new veins are attached , that is a wrong belief.	4.439623860663963

Sick veins are not taken out instead in that vein a new vein is attached in front of the block or restriction , the blood flow remains intact itself by this.	4.342584761629844

In the matter of artery blockage bypass surgery is the best option.	5.871186278865003

Initially bypass surgery was done by stopping the heartbeats.	7.167440129484284

By this there used to be an effect on other parts kidney , liver , lungs etc.	5.267596138563411

Now with new method beating heart surgery only that place of the heart is stopped where surgery has to happen.	5.381288806603301

In the previous method seven - eight bottles of blood was required in the surgery of the heart , whereas in beating heart surgery one to two bottles of blood is enough.	4.868842022262352

The patient also gets discharged from the hospital in seven days.	3.8720379514269756

In the new techniques of bypass surgery beating heart surgery is successful.	4.650566925815374

By this the patients have less difficulty , and they get discharged from the hospital in seven days.	3.869529783815753

Friends , for achieving success it is very essential to wake early morning.	7.70275262894564

By this the health also remains fine and you feel interested in studies also.	4.701121512872684

How to get up early in the morning , for this some tips are being given.	5.958159621925365

Develop the habit of getting up at four or five in the morning.	5.944573999651833

The time you get up everyday , start getting up 15 to 30 minutes earlier.	5.84337081657348

Do not keep the alarm clock near the bed , because you can switch off the alarm in sleep because of laziness.	3.637863831030944

Keep the clock that far that you can hear it.	6.361215028435997

Do not watch TV till late in the night.	5.029582783617368

Do not sit for long at the computer.	6.039852950766919

Sleep early , only then will you wake early.	7.71176124154537

After getting up from the bed once do not lie on the bed again.	5.058085949839225

Before sleeping decide this that why you have to get up in the morning.	5.524589803869014

Have to study , have to do jogging or some other work.	7.422873988859574

If there is a reason to get up then there will be ease in getting up early.	6.060453935034395

The sight of sunrise is very nice.	7.402921314835952

The environment is silent.	13.47461264941821

Cool breezes blow.	20.197587032483398

Along with the body the mind also becomes pleasant.	8.360682469900821

By getting up early you will be able to see these sights.	6.3933259350200675

Eating according to necessity does not mean this that one thing should be eaten more.	6.403756940763384

There is no one food which can fulfil the needs of your body or your strength.	4.9207506781709425

That is why there is necessity of variance in your food.	4.209037095710803

Eating that same one type of food all the time we limit the nutritious elements in our diet.	4.959423395905831

So for balanced diet we should choose some foods from the main food groups everyday.	4.486979383696128

Grains like rice , roti , doubleroti etc they give strength for play and work.	5.1651291023086126

Pulses and milk give us protein and help us in growing.	5.401447849324498

Fruits and vegetables give us vitamin , minerals and fibers.	5.325586165973269

Apart from fruits and vegetables we get fiber from grains like wheat , oatmeal etc.	4.86318687679208

We get help in digesting properly by fibers.	7.595522290085769

For staying healthy and for growing properly fats like ghee is important.	5.494435545681718

But by too much fat in the diet obesity , heart attacks and some types of cancer can also happen.	5.200393348223785

That is why eat things fried in oil processed cheese paneer , butter , cream , ice cream and chocolate etc least.	3.683175532690014

By eating too many sweets harm can befall your teeth and decay too.	4.8420691508341696

This makes you fat and lazy.	8.290518147263265

This is true that for growing and for working you need strength.	5.308789327062379

For this if you eat roti , rice , potato , yam etc and do a little abstinence from white sugar , jaggery , sugar , then it will be better.	4.458275731992813

After eating it is good to take less sweet things and les or absolutely no sugar in milk , tea or coffee.	4.113766199997733

Juice of fruits are much better than soft drinks like cola.	5.539829789303404

Steam pressure , baking or cooking by roasting , is better than boiling because by this beneficial substances can be saved in the food.	5.149366728221342

For working and taking the enjoyment of life there should be strength in the body.	5.506742409793277

The body gets this energy by eating.	6.564290694686015

Calorie , energy of eating If we eat more than the necessity of our body then it will deposit on our body as fat.	6.927313231923337

After working , reading , exercise , illness for reaching the previous condition and growing , along with fuel there is also the necessity of nutrition.	4.327319322294655

It is best for the health not to smoke.	6.562360669068794

There are more than 400 harmful and toxic chemical substances in the smoke of tobacco like nicotine , tar , carbon monoxide etc.	4.039931940743598

Cigarette , bidi , hukka , chilum , pipe are also harmful.	6.9166296702474215

Similar to cocaine , heroin and other addictive substances , there is nicotine poison in tobacco , which is an addictive thing.	4.392331231706941

On the addiction of nicotine coming once man starts being dependent on it and can not leave its habit easily.	4.426724785382253

That is why people who are smokers have difficulty in leaving smoking.	4.999152632701664

The smoke of tobacco harms your body and cancer of lungs , throat etc , heart disease and are the reason of lung diseases of long duration like bronchitis , asthma etc.	4.7856303925455315

By this tolerance power is also lost.	7.289680932885193

By this infertility can also occur.	7.890200385143981

If you want to remain active and fit then say ' no ' to smoking.	3.5583357080272147

Do not be influenced by your friends or by advertisements of cigarettes.	4.331037469971644

Do not let the eagerness of smoking dominate over yourself.	4.356440090914143

A smoker also has a bad effect on people near him.	6.2349246506891145

Burning cigarette or bidi throws smoke outside in the air then it increases the amount of smoke in the air.	5.368831529478857

The people sitting in that room also take this smoke in their lungs.	5.105121034987187

They become ' passive smokers '.	11.336536755057685

The meaning of it is this that other people who are not smoking also , even then the harmful effect of cigarette happens on their lungs and heart.	4.831617371202036

This way the person who smokes causes harm to the members of his family , friends and people near him.	4.363274134900175

Out of 1000 500 young people who smoke will in the end , die from diseases happening due to tobacco.	3.8637643528658376

Out of 1000 young people who smoke 250 will die in middle age only.	3.9414712922092248

Normally in comparison to non smokers they reduce 22 years of their life.	5.622647652618831

250 smokers will die in old age but they will have remained sick with diseases happening due to tobacco.	4.597253845670949

If smokers can make up their minds , they can leave it.	5.678295617829667

For this there is the necessity of mental strength and determination.	5.929048488953525

The attachment of this addiction puts him in difficulty many times , but with his trying and the help of his family and friends can achieve victory over this.	4.241308108845662

Tobacco is harmful in any form.	10.453456908888153

For making cigarette many trees are cut every year wood is burnt for preparing tobacco.	4.090454494694879

Someone has cut a tree somewhere behind every three hundred cigarettes.	5.268662536021571

You are yourself responsible for your health.	5.837031464985466

Those people who inspire you to smoke , do not listen to them.	4.260227527413396

For doing weight loss people start staying hungry and the effect of this is seen clearly on their health.	4.99051342259267

In reality when we reduce eating then its meaning is this that we stop giving the body such necessary elements , which is essential for a healthy body.	3.7601247515610776

That is why whenever you think of reducing weight , keep this thing in mind that there should not be a lack of nutritious elements in the body.	3.9802366605556565

Always take proper and healthy diet.	6.782618503424494

In some people there are weight and health problems on becoming adults , because they diet and take unhealthy weight loss diet for weight loss in childhood.	3.884836114273371

For decreasing weight the permission for dieting is not given till then , till there is not complete physical development and this condition comes by the age of 18.	4.740265423364997

If you are less than 18 years and are overweight then consult your doctor or dietician.	2.9500714958630248

They will tell you such a healthy diet plan by which along with good health weight will not increase.	4.354479797147118

For this talk to your parents also.	3.705078174094173

Studies say that strict dieting done for some time in teenage becomes the reason for ' Low Bone Density ' , which makes the bones weak with advancing age.	4.200821294499515

It has been found that in 90 percent of those who diet in the age of 12 - 17 have had lack of ' bone mass ' on becoming adults.	4.646512923722857

That is why from childhood you should definitely take the requirements of your body like calcium , vitamin D or vitamin C and all other nutritious elements which are important for bone growth.	3.8391056801997623

Dieting also becomes the reason for the deficiency of folic acid and iron in the body.	4.512071913005207

These two save from nutritients anemia.	8.133104367879554

Because of staying busy in school , sports and other activities in that age you should refrain from the ' ill - effects ' of anemia.	3.1778845188950444

Strict dieting can never keep your health and diet alright.	4.3140150019216525

Give preference to healthy food and daily exercise.	5.305009333060118

This helps in keeping the weight controlled along with your health.	5.424091331061953

Healthy diet ' is not only one.	15.243980649537992

You are eating various types of food for a long time , all the vitamins , minerals and other nutritional elements which are necessary for you , are found from the main food groups fruits , vegetables , grains rice , oats , meats , dairy products , fats.	3.322209652312508

The meaning of healthy food is not this that you stay away from high calorie foods like ice cream , toffee , popcorn , cheese burger etc.	3.3902450578527428

You eat these and foods similar to these but in small quantities and sometimes.	4.855576170245878

As beautiful as a strawberry looks it is as much filled with benefits.	5.578184961911729

Like other berries high amounts of anti oxidants especially anticyanine type - 2 and ellagitannins are found in strawberries.	4.3150478857840495

Because of these pigments the color of the strawberries is red.	5.11945634515244

Researches have proved this that anthocyanins like antioxidant lessens the diseases related to cancer , cardiovascular disease and inflammation.	3.964723617431166

As such strawberry is a foreign fruit and it is considered the favorite fruit of Europe.	4.122130706374301

But now it is favored a lot in India also.	6.757270033785761

Because of this reason only in some mountainous areas of India the farming of strawberries has started being done.	3.8699846600923458

The main reason for the increasing fascination towards this fruit are the medicinal properties found in this.	4.550560207128853

In this there is already an abundance of potassium , iron , calcium and vitamin A and C because of the capability of not letting cholesterol build in the body this fruit is especially miraculous for heart patients also.	4.820798273042275

Apart from eating it raw in the form of a fruit it is used in squash , jam and many other foods for strawberry test.	4.14076624901451

In the plant of strawberry which grows to four inches the fruits grow in the form of bunches , which become of a deep red color on ripening.	3.35604392606842

These fruits can be kept safe at the most for two days only.	4.9429051314734

Not only this , on keeping in the freezer also black spots appear on them.	4.464401800511825

That is why for preserving its qualities they should be kept in the open and should be consumed as soon as possible.	4.091916042812008

Take fruits in the form of snacks.	7.757688733311834

Keep some walnuts in them for extra crunch.	7.340579276219601

Eat light sweets also.	11.67850105468634

The dinner of your choice : - The most easy way of taking a healthy meal is that you decide that you will take half plate of vegetables and on the other half proteins meat , eggs , beans and carbohydrates rice , roti , paratha , pasta , potato , noodles in equal portions.	3.4599469838381482

If you want to eat pizza then give preference to cheese and pepperoni in light pizza and vegetables and fruit pizza in heavy pizzas.	2.842007583497013

If some child is more fat with relation to his age or body mass density BMI or if the amount of body fat in the body is found to be more then he is overweight or a victim of obesity.	4.977596889369549

Especially if a child of 3 - 4 years or some child is afflicted with obesity then by this a bad or negative effect falls on his health.	4.895474606441076

Physician doctor K.K.Agarwal in Moolchand hospital says , those children who are excessively fat , there are two main reasons for that - first genetic in which is present the genetic factor and the other life style in which is present lifestyle , food habits , environment factors etc.	3.78583160502826

In genetic factors if the parents or some family member is fat then the child may also be fat.	5.39874975779289

If the mother - father both are fat then there remains 80 percent possibility of the child being fat and 40 percent when some one from mother - father is fat.	4.754369377313602

In today 's fast life the busyness of elders has increased so much that they have started showing negligence towards the food habits of children along with themselves.	3.932072356471156

Now fast food full of high calories has taken the place of healthy food.	6.42326676102743

According to Dr.K.K.Agarwal , today in place of nutritious salad and fruits children give attention to pizza and burger whose result is coming forward in the form of excess fatness.	3.9507671179176396

Being almost not involved in physical activities , giving attention to hours of virtual gaming , electronic games , video games and watching TV etc increases the calories which is the main reason for weight increase.	3.9021749393975966

Digestive related problems are also common in fat children like the complaint of indigestion , constipation etc always remains.	5.346793084876114

Obesity in childhood becomes a condition of chronic medical condition.	7.060925814272894

Those people who are afflicted with obesity from childhood in them the danger of chronic disease is more than those who smoke , drink a lot.	5.519751370134722

Excess fatness in small age also becomes the reason for infertility on growing older.	5.711607155676536

By this because of sleep and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa , shorter life span , high cholestrol , high blood pressure , lack of stamina and overweight body mass the complaints of pain in joints and bones etc can be seen.	4.2530982929576275

Today obesity in children throughout the world is going on increasing in an alarming way.	5.595804057338978

Physical inactivity , a diet full of fats and calories and genetics pushes children towards obesity to a large extent.	3.591608551248602

Through a strict and balanced diet obesity can be brought in control.	5.33400764870707

Especially parents should also make use of balanced diet only then their kids will not be genetically influenced.	5.622680877718713

Along with that it is very important to exercise daily , encourage children towards physical activity , stop them from watching TV for more than 2 hours , and give them nutritious diet instead of junk food.	3.901694661452103

Treatment is also a way for obese children.	10.987567883465408

Like stomach bypass surgery and liposuction prove very effective in this.	5.7716723097154405

Originally this is a vegetable of America.	10.96709903697322

In reality its farming is happening for thousands of years in tropical America.	4.55161731229135

Its farming is done in our country also and it is used in the form of a major vegetable.	7.045410579260467

Its use is done in the form of a medicine and hotness in vegetables.	4.913258537170907

Apart from its unique taste and fragrance a high level of nutrition is found in capsicum.	5.781138737405873

Many types of proteins and fats are also found in this.	5.244819975476436

Vitamin A and C and provitamin E , P , B 1 , B 2 and B 3 etc are also found in this colorful vegetable.	4.874106183302913

Its mucous membrane is beneficial for eyes and skin.	9.097334003255408

This also saves from infection.	9.981597825499398

By helping in reducing blood pressure this promotes cardiovascular health.	5.497725779551234

It makes the basic elements of tissue and cell damage ineffective by the antioxidant properties.	4.0338817937708535

This helps in reducing cholesterol as a result of which the possibility of stroke and heart attack becomes less.	5.39883106816926

By increasing the speed of metabolism this burns more and more calories.	6.123764742065715

This also works in the treatment of cold and fever.	7.408968731427741

For patients of diabetes capsicum is helpful.	8.715174767740269

Meat is not the natural diet of man.	9.82275723362974

Those people who eat meat , uric acid is produced in more quantity in their blood.	5.289288784641875

This uric acid gives birth to blood disorders , heart disease , tuberculosis , insomnia , hypertension , liver disease etc apart from arthritis and urinary disorders.	4.0627531273890645

The fat present in meat and the excess amount of cholesterol gets deposited in the internal vessels of the blood vessels of the body of a carnivorous person and makes them narrow by which a restriction is generated in the blood flow.	4.7308651203117025

The fat present in the fat and ghee obtained from animals , butter , meat , fish , eggs increases the amount of cholesterol in the blood with rapidity , by which the situation of high blood pressure starts developing.	4.950287435108064

So much so that by paralysis and the restriction in the blood of the heart by bleeding in the brain heart stroke and heart attack can also happen.	4.8290228523981

If a person decreases the amount of cholesterol in the diet then he can escape from the disease of the gall bladder.	5.446959315343051

Healthy kidneys of a person can do emissions of uric acid in the quantity of seven grain everyday only.	5.861950689037293

But enough pressure falls on the kidneys on more amount of uric acid by a carnivorous by which stones start forming in them or swelling starts happening in its cells.	4.224034388461875

If this situation remains for a long time then the kidneys stop working.	4.7722215797085035

In reality meat is not the food of man.	8.695551088161258

The organization of his body , teeth and food pipe also does not have any similarity to the composition of the intestines of carnivorous animals.	5.125042743106376

Like carnivorous animals the length of the small and big intestines of man is more than even four times the length of his body.	5.632932311543003

Along with this , for meat many times the murder of such animals is also done which are sick.	4.813032834440526

If you do not consider that you look ' dashing ' by a cigarette attached to your lips then change your thinking , because it has been asserted in a new study that the IQ of a person decreases by smoking.	3.9077371176296363

The Intelligence Quotient scale of intelligence measure of a person is less in comparison to a person who smokes cigarette.	6.285909766497275

It was found in a study that smoking has to do with the IQ of a person.	3.8492694498411786

According to a published study in addiction journal , the average IQ of persons who do not smoke remained 101 whereas smoking persons remained seven points less 93.	3.60512894792846

The IQ of youth smoking more than one packet in one day remained nearly 90.	5.6115503083539116

Does sexual activity decrease with the increasing age , this question has been the topic of debate for a long time but it has been said in a report published in the British Medical Journal recently that its strings are attached to healthy life , especially in males.	3.7844107345066305

In old age in comparison to women men remain sexually active more than twice.	5.142829350273311

This matter came forward in the studies of the researchers of the University of Chicago.	5.003635663952111

It has been said in the studies , ' Men and women of very good health , are more active in comparison to men and women of average or bad health '.	3.960900726284629

It has been said in this that men and women of good health can show 1.5 to 1.8 times more interest in sex in comparison to men and women of bad health.	4.328024785309489

Associate professor Stacey Teslar and research associate Natalia Gavrilova has produced this conclusion on the studying of more than six thousand data of 25 to 85 years.	3.840125806333123

For men the sexual activity time is more long , but because of bad health in comparison to women men lose more years of sexual activity.	4.522488970108403

In the published report this was also found that those people who remain more sex - active , there is more hope of their being more healthy.	4.714480093952174

In this it is said that , ' In men among people active in a sexual way good health is linked to this sex specially.	4.328456007744841

It was also found in the report that similar healthy sexual relations , are not the same in men and women.	4.511262577893659

For instance , at the age of 55 in men of very good or grand health in comparison to men of bad health an increase of 5 -7 years ordinarily happens in sexually active life.	4.21343998736966

This thing is not applicable on women.	7.3719436090346475

In women with very good or grand health in comparison to women with bad health there is ordinarily an increase of 3 - 6 years in the sexually active life.	3.6233779923962706

It was found in a study that sexual activity , sex life of high quality and interest in sex is more in men compared to women and this keeps increasing with age gaps.	4.11838932285414

They said the brain of men first hears the music and its lyrics together , and then during a complex process understands the lyrics.	3.6958352629614444

After this the brain starts behaving differently with both.	3.5619360228132924

They got to know from the MRI of a music listening person that when the active part of the brain gives attention to the music and when it gives attention to the lyrics of the song.	4.1967257883700215

Scientists got to know that neurons process again and again with one then with time their response starts decreasing.	4.883353756863773

They accepted that when they decrease and increase only the voice and keep the rhythm there then the areas showing less activity must certainly be working on the lyrics of the song.	3.6556323632528347

They prepared four sets of six different songs which volunteers were made to listen.	4.408257013559729

During this scanning of their brain was done.	5.821919382463853

After this test the top scientist connected with the team Daniela Sammler said , the brain initially takes music and its lyrics together.	3.7294573609765256

After this the brain goes through a complex process and understands the lyrics.	3.7233273309299544

After understanding the lyrics the brain starts behaving differently with both.	3.8618046091418803

The thyroid gland can become a danger for your young age.	7.143127722072228

Yes , it has been claimed in a new study thyroid increases the danger of a heart attack in young people till quite an extent.	4.754404786002509

According to the Stroke Journal of the American Heart Association researchers have found in their study that if thyroid is more than usually active in young people then it increases the danger of a heart attack in them up to 44 percent.	3.819699783484055

Researchers did this comparison with those people in whom this gland remains constant.	6.371379759115335

The main author in the journal and Professor Hernag - Ching Linn in the Taipei Medical University of Taiwan was quoted as saying ' Our study shows the relation between Hyperthoidism and heart attack '.	2.883402584326848

The attacks about which we can not find out they are between one third to one fourth of the heart attacks which come in young age.	4.769556201962758

Linn said in our knowledge hyperthyroidism has never been seen ever as a big danger in the heart attacks happening between 18 to 44 years of age.	4.30482937128774

It is interesting that the more than necessary remaining active of the thyroid gland is called ' hyperthyroidism '.	5.472538578418407

This is a common problem which shows its effect in 0.5 percent one in every 200 to 2 percent one in every 50 people in the population of the whole world.	4.257623498691004

In the Lavanya Ayurvedic Cancer Hospital and Research Centre the treatment of cancer is possible from the root by ayurvedic medicine.	4.486698731268249

There have been innumerable successful uses of finishing the cancer disease from the root.	4.611302009133205

Thousands of patients have got life profit.	7.786817944111399

Because cancer is a distortion occurring at the level of D.N.A.of cells and ayurveda medicine is successful in making the distortion at the D.N.A.level of the cell alright.	3.8983105880103777

In the Lavanya Ayurvedic hospital there has been the successful treatment of many cancer patients of the country and abroad.	4.788637197763041

Cancer happens because of the increase on an arbitrary basis in the cells of the body.	5.8227377129938045

When this increase takes the form of a wound and does not heal for a long time then its checking is done through CT scan ultrasound.	4.931553479053467

If this growth is found to be increased then through F.C.or biopsy the checking of the samples extracted from this is done so that the confirmation of this matter is done that it is cancer or not and if it is then in what state.	4.227225031331553

After this check surgery radiotherapy , chemotherapy and sometimes by giving hormonal supplements the attempt of a cure can be done.	4.014838287978201

Along with this on doing operation as soon as scissors run on the cancer cells its unchecked growth becomes even faster and again the support of radiation and chemotherapy is taken.	3.8494814708709395

Radiation occurs through X - ray or Cobalt - ray by which along with cancerous cells many healthy cells also get destroyed.	3.980378861982137

By exposure to radiation for a long time the body can not get over and the dangerous side effect is this that the cells battered by radiation come under the grip of cancer the fastest.	4.556283808382675

This way there is a basis of chemotherapy is to destroy the chemical substances of the cancerous cells so that their unrestricted growth can be checked.	4.492170730949149

But because the chemical substance can not recognize that which cells are cancer affected and which are healthy cells without cancer.	4.190319281976858

That destroys everything outright by which healthy cells also get influenced and become incapable.	4.68406555338509

When the capability of cells in the body finishes then the spread of cancer from one place to the other or activity of the metastasis increases.	5.092972707671912

The other ill effects of chemotherapy are very bad like the fattening of the skin of the body , the digestive activity going bad , not feeling hungry , mouth remaining continuously dry , loss of hair and the fattening of the nerves because of which while giving drip one has to face difficulty in piercing injection.	4.229924887004901

There are many ill effects of the medicine given by hormonal supplements.	5.859544622586664

This way we see that with these three types of medicines the patient gets respite for a few days , but for correcting the distortion come on the D.N.A.level of the cell one has to understand the Tridosh theory Vata , Pitta and Kapha by which the conduct of the whole body happens.	4.148803326341616

We can understand this by the example of an engine of a car.	5.213105884331216

The engine runs by the birth of pressure of compressor the vata dosh of Ayurveda as if does the work of the compressor for the engine styled body.	3.893456241576718

If the compressor becomes more than usually active then there can be an explosion in the engine.	4.830214969040346

If the compressor is less then the engine does not take pick up.	4.8339256072742165

Along with the compressor being made the temperature of the engine also increases.	4.99241389325544

The role of the gall in the engine styled body is like temperature.	5.218122973863879

If the temperature of the engine increases more than necessary then the engine gets and if this becomes less than necessity then the engine does not start only.	4.398669060703309

Now if you are making the temperature of the engine favourable and there is not enough friction in the internal parts of it then the use of lubricants is necessary.	5.40649530686588

This way if there is no friction in the parts of the body and the temperature remains favourable then it is essential for a kind of viscosity to remain made.	5.3055778639504725

This work is of kafa in the body.	6.135289810677175

If the lubricant is less then the engine and if it is more then the engine misfires , exactly like this the condition of the engine styled body , the happens due to the lack of kafa happening more.	4.485207279665296

After understanding the Tridosh theory now we look at the metabolism happening continuously in the body.	4.163859928124303

Whatever we eat , drink , goes in our stomach and by this activity begins in the.	5.624100342621035

The nutritious element of the food from the intestine changes into blood , meat , fat , bone , semen and energy respectively this is called dhatu in Ayurveda.	4.273171717458494

In the activity of their making there is some remaining part which is shit.	5.5188014783986965

It is not enough for the nutritional elements to reach the body only how they turn into dhatu and shit with the help of , this is an important issue of life and health.	4.496838700098838

This can also be understood with the help of an example.	9.02241129580722

There is a fire ignited in the fire pit and samidha is being poured from the top.	4.007048563421671

If the fire is being lighted in the correct manner then the samidha will take the form of ash , but if we went on putting more samidha in the fire than its capacity or if we put more wood in the fire then then fire will get dim , then the samidha will not become ash but start turning into coal.	3.3659504426284883

Exactly like this more food taken in than the capacity of hunger remains indigested , then stool become abnormal or underdone and becomes what is called aam which begins the activity of spreading rot.	3.834697164885151

Then instead of the food being prepared with full energy begins turning into ' dhuan ' or gas.	4.780732371566913

Nutritional elements are reached by blood vessels in every cell situated in the body.	4.974251239943703

Where the activity of catabolism takes place by the fire of the cells.	5.3359771392288025

When this falls low then nutritional elements are not digested properly.	4.41432830198674

They stay stuck in the cells , can not come out in the form of shit.	7.271175279497197

Such unrecognizable cells are known by the name of free radical cells in modern medicine and the activity of catabolism is known by the name of deoxidation.	4.044414924084166

The first starting of cancer building is considered from here only.	4.792268770042898

If we sketch this condition of the unrecognizable cells on the criterion of the theory of the afore mentioned Tridosh of Ayurveda then we can say this that there can be three reasons for this condition of the cells - Vata , Pitta and Kafa.	3.990293932198236

If the Kafa i.e.lubricant or viscosity increases then it will narrow or choke the hole of the cells because of which the waste of the cells will not be able to come out.	4.478096646957603

If Pitta increases then because of the temperature increasing their size increases due to the ionic change in the outside walls of the cells.	6.268322244418669

And the holes become choked.	8.571859184007332

This way if the Vata increases then it squeezes the cell from the outside.	4.055181127350315

By this also the holes of the cell get blocked.	6.065965292828819

We saw that on the increase of all three Kafa Pitta and Vata the result came out as the same that the holes of the cell closed.	4.425172552036863

According to Ayurveda it is important to know for the increase of which dosha in the three especially has the disease occurred.	4.956628774895907

The diagnosis of Ayurveda is not only the result but also to understand the circumstance of the of dosha the patient.	5.014028885076982

Although in modern medicine in view of the result the medicine is given but that medicine may be increasing the Pitta and the cells have closed because of the increase in Pitta , by this instead of benefits the possibility of harm increases.	4.195099150423688

In Allopathic medicine there is no way of knowing this that the holes in the cells occurred due to the which special reason of the three , the treatment starts without knowing the actual reason then the imbalance between the three dosha of the body becomes even more.	5.178176962448287

As a result the condition of the cells begins to worsen more , it moves more towards being incurable.	4.106964401098289

One thing more is worth knowing that according to Ayurveda if there can be damage of 6 levels inside of the cells like - Save collect , Prasar spread , outbreak infection of cells , dwelling place space loss , individual cell damage , differentiate change in the identity of the cell.	3.7688221767085652

When the activity of battering starts happening in the cells then its nucleus or DNA as if starts experiencing this that its identity will not be preserved.	4.691184047109064

During this the nucleus catches the tempo of multiplying many times by dividing itself and forgets the instructions of the commander styled brain.	3.358077928220065

Here the meaning of the instruction of the commander of the brain is that instrument or apparatus under which so far it was driven.	4.182028972259828

Like in the body if generally some part gets injured then the cells and tissues there give their full contribution according to the formation of that place.	5.22377359896266

But when the cells become rampant then they become not favourable of the body but unfavourable.	5.582542255534511

Medicine in Lavanya Ayurvedic Hospital and Research Centre happens according to Yukti vyapakshya , Devopakshya and Satvavajay through Ayurveda.	3.305254506928478

The prior work or preparations of Panchakarma are - Pachan Digestion , Snehan Lubrication and Swedan.	3.9746262716948855

After this under the activity of purification are Vamana , Virechana , Vasti , Nasya and Raktamoshana.	4.177066578016988

Under purification medicine the most important thing is this that the possibility of common diseases occurring a second time finishes.	5.75045425592043

By Panchakarma the three dosha of Vata , Pitta and Kafa go away.	4.281221635892217

In other words with Panchakarma the entire body becomes detoxified or free of toxins.	4.419701191243339

All cells of the body become pure and clean.	10.093956615377706

Because cancer is a difficult disease , that is why its treatment is not possible with only plants and herbs.	5.901785549688052

For this one has to take the help of chemotherapy.	8.466332463744985

If the disease is outside then its miasma can be removed by the use of the medicines on the particular place of the body.	4.786942407613688

But if this is inside the body then in this condition the use of medicines applied on that particular place would not have been possible.	6.233447436883264

Therefore in these matters treatment is possible only by the medicines taken through the mouth.	6.3353290407936225

Here also if the miasma of the ulcer is in the beginning stage then success is achieved and if the part of the body with the ulcer has melted and finished then till what extent will success be achieved , this can not be said from before.	4.407366854384884

But it becomes essential to cut and remove that rotten part of the body but in this condition also the tendency in the cancerous cells to increase itself somehow with uncontrolled and fast speed has been finished from before.	3.9053192757151636

After having given radiotherapy and chemotherapy many times also the cells which were still being a challenge to medicine the activity of their proliferation stops.	3.9112507944938835

Therefore this is a matter of happiness that in these matters also success is fully possible.	4.995663728075776

This way a campaign is going on in Lavanya to finish cancer from the root.	4.612086726358131

For children and teenagers obesity has been considered a big matter that is why for saving them from obesity some parents and children themselves too keep their footsteps carefully.	3.9937145489672896

But recently this matter has come forward by a study that if the fruit juice is hundred percent pure and sugar is not mixed in it then that does not become a reason for fatness.	5.263014407449269

This study was presented in the meeting of the paediatric society happening in Toronto of Canada.	3.899569889885001

This is quite an important study , because it has been ascertained by this that there is no danger of fatness by pure juice and it can be taken in appropriate amount.	4.935345159957175

But in relation to drinking this juice some things have to be kept in mind.	5.452165415046801

Like this that the canned juice you take from the market should be 100 percent pure juice of fruit.	5.455587917870992

If other nutritious elements are mixed in it then also it is important to keep this information that there should not have been any negative effect on the quality of its fruit.	5.806720560696136

Then drink such juices more in which there is enough juice because there is less necessity to mix other elements like - juice of orange.	5.601814329442432

If in the place of the juice of orange you take the juice of apple then know that hundred percent purity of this juice is not possible.	5.241899126885588

In these messenger RNA are hidden.	7.386195555003299

Complete it.	6.864837401292388

The cells present in that bone marrow soak these micro vesicles.	4.71482898867548

Later they do the creation of new cells.	8.007191075880806

A matter of surprise is this that scientists know about microvesciles since the last 40 years , but no one looked at their role.	4.619480139488429

Now Eliota says , ' Actually this is a major information bearer , which does the work of reaching information between the cells.'.	4.742386781486597

Aorta artery begins from the chest goes to the lower part in the stomach and its branches reach blood in the lower reaches and the legs too.	7.25875298968692

Disorders happening in this can prove fatal , but advancement happening in medical knowledge can defeat this disease.	4.625927661078582

Sometimes with advancing age or atherosclerosis hardness of arteries or because of high blood pressure some part of the aorta gets weak and that starts spreading towards the outside.	4.682258256067539

This spread keeps increasing with time and the wall of the aorta keeps getting thin stretches and bloats up like a balloon.	4.345528534237728

In some patients of Thoracic Aorta Aneurysm there can be pain in the chest , difficulty in breathing , having pain in swallowing and congestion in coughing.	4.6070501003886495

In those patients of abdominal aortic Aneurysm where the symptoms occur , in those major are pain happening in stomach , chest or back.	4.307614444460559

If the aneurysm is small then on intervals of some days one has to take medical prescription on checking and has to keep the blood pressure in balance.	5.36398641294841

If the doctor feels that there is a danger of the aneurysm bursting , then any one of these treatments can be executed in these two types.	4.228784883906444

By putting a cut on the stomach or chest the aneurysm part of the aorta can be cut and a pipe is sewn in its place.	4.711156455559746

In this surgical repairing the danger to the life of the patient is 10 %.	6.454733440240125

In endovascular repair without an operation being done a stat graph is put on the aorta from the inside and it is repaired.	4.69097260798808

In the traditional facelift surgery skin Incision is required.	4.208209939154086

But if the incision is to be done to the skin in the front and back of the ear , then usually its marks are not particularly visible.	5.685902060214951

To escape the flaws and sideeffects of the facelift surgery especially then , when there is no undesirable skin on the face or such skin is negligible , then to make the face look young barbes pointed.	4.323193564924817

This procedure is called threadlift.	7.497933843213659

This procedure can be done in very little time , with local or sedation anesthesia and after getting it done you can live your normal life within a day or two.	3.884652303737229

Complete it.	6.864837401292388

This is a very popular cosmetic procedure.	4.806599992825423

With this the the nerve stimulation reduces till the muscle , the muscle relaxes and the face looks fresh and young.	3.5447520352340924

Dermabrasion is a cosmetic medical procedure , under which the upper layer of the skin is removed through abrasion sanding.	3.9557801210135635

To do this same work in a refined style lazer is also used.	5.037354168575482

This technique is applied to remove the sun damaged skin or to remove or reduce the marks and spots on the skin.	4.476162362327377

Dermabrasion is helpful when some scar - spot is raised on the skin , but this procedure is not so effective when the marks are very deep and immersed.	3.7530954397598415

This activity can be painful and normally an anesthesia is required for this.	5.3700663921101635

Rhinoplasty is generally also called as ' nose reshaping ' and ' nose job '.	4.642556780479424

This is a surgical procedure , in which the functions of the nose or its shape - size is improved.	4.7154008696869525

The objective of Rhinoplasty is to make the nose such that it looks in sync with rest of the face structure.	4.428985837355979

This is an artistic job , because the surgeon also considers how would the ' new ' nose look in future.	3.024484427609744

How many times it has to be done ? 	7.84613983479169

But if the result does n't please or there is a need for improvement , then after a year a ' revision ' or ' touch up rhinoplasty ' is done.	3.583486018897585

Lazer has been used since last 10 years or even more to pour a new life in the skin.	5.352816067802947

Anyway , ' fractional ablation ' is the latest technology of the skin.	5.259670897240091

Under this new skin emerges very soon , whereas before this when the ablative lasers were used , then it took time for the fresh skin to emerge.	3.6587489338134986

Fractional laser , is suitable for the treatment of light wrinkles and with it a special glow comes on the skin.	5.2770625785722975

Actually , in dark chocolates there are amino acids named tryptophan phenylalanine and thyroxine in high amount.	3.7621232155882294

Like the other amino acids these compounds full of nitrogen are very important part for the proteins of the entire body , they have another wonderful quality too , these are the ' precurser ' that is the early form of adrenaline.	3.382082149645855

When you are tensed then this harmone itself excites you for action , in which the Dopamine named neurotransmitter does the important work of sending signals to the nerve fibers of the brain.	3.6412498146775327

Scientists claim that Dopamine enables the sexual feelings.	5.7098102826838835

That means if your partner has the desire of chocolate , then for that neuro chemicals are responsible.	4.313215742997606

Now if we talk especially about the lover , then chocolate can help in the firmness while erection.	3.591590979392288

The inner layer of the blood vessels of the penis is called Endothelium , which is responsible for producing nitric oxide.	4.43789403137567

Related to this when 17 healthy men were given 100 grams of dark chocolate to eat in a study done by Greek and Swiss researchers , then there came rapid improvement in their Endothelial function.	3.587463278274406

Remember , only those dark chocolates are effective in increasing the sex activeness , in which the amount of coco is 70 to 80 percent.	5.366032320146407

White and milk chocolates are useless in this regard.	5.212144555606273

Heart experts have warned that those people should not use aspirin to prevent heart blood vessels related problems.	4.357792806327509

Who have no heart related problems and who are healthy.	5.5282672046437105

It was earlier scientifically proved that if the person suffering with heart blood vessels problem intakes aspirin daily , then it could help the prevention of heart attacks and strokes.	4.460621128072082

But now the experts advise the healthy people to not take it , because with it there are more chances of danger than benefit.	5.186027236572542

According to a study report published in the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin with the intake of the blood thinning aspirin the danger of blood leakage in the stomach increases , hence to prevent cardiovascular disease along with healthy people those people too should take ' low doze ' aspirin.	3.812141165066707

There is a danger of serious bleeding in those whose blood pressure is high or those who are the patient of Diabetes.	5.656995658405204

In the older times people used to make forecasts of the fruit on the basis of dreams.	4.562017046875785

But the scientists are not unanimous on the causes of dreaming and its results.	3.806396677763377

Some scientists believe that whatever is seen in the dreams , those are the thoughts covered in our subconsious mind.	4.277432525445943

Whereas some scientists believe this that dreams are the result of the electrical activity taking place in our brain.	4.132047599306801

According to the scientists dreams are not at all the source of forecasts and the evidence found of this too is very less that dreams affects health.	3.8176745709361644

According to a recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology the people of varied cultures believe that dreams carry certain reality.	3.0915668914489247

The truth is that we know very little about the results of experienced dreams , though the sleep and dreams may be suggesting some direction or solution to our serious problems.	2.8975139213333314

There can be more dreaming because of the intake of some special type of medicines besides certain high blood pressure medicines.	6.191107331056699

Having pimples is a normal problem during adolescence , for which familial effect matters a lot.	5.001328902284425

According to the experts in the Dessau Medical Centre located in Germany amongst the adolsecents participating in the study the danger of pimple occurrence was three times more in those , whose mothers have ever had moderate to serious pimple problem.	3.6959919000910104

But those adolescents whose fathers suffered from the above problem , the danger of pimples was only two times in their adult kids.	4.361457883339677

According to the researchers in the case of production of pimples where the family that is genetic effect is concerned , then in this the ' X ' chromosome play an important role.	4.098182302466435

Anyway , in the study besides family history oily skin was also found to be primarily responsible for the pimples.	4.250943698974552

In Ayurvedic treatment Banyan has a lot of medicinal importance.	6.571421053595951

According to a research going on under the Allahabad U.P.University , the quantity of antioxidants is the most in the roots hanging in the air of banyan.	4.509890214505623

Due to this it would help prevent the causes of aging.	5.712014308007456

Complete it.	6.864837401292388

As a result of this research the chances of using banyan as a powerful anti aging medicine are prominent.	4.250260466921108

This is a common mentality that men become the victim of sexual dysfunction more.	4.591613848157373

With many studies it has been known that women become the victim of sexual dysfunction more than men.	4.3106256663921485

Where 31 percent of males become the victim of sexual dysfunction , in females this ratio is 43 percent.	4.554036383655168

The above problem in aged females leads to more adverse condition.	4.969940567974742

According to a recent survey report done on 31 , 581 women in the females of 45 to 64 years of age the problems related to sex urge , excitement and orgasm are found upto 44.6 percent.	3.522720946408383

Whereas this figure was 27.2 percent in the females of the age group of 18 to 44 years.	5.318639593877101

Usually the women of over 50 years of age the risk of getting into osteoporosis is more.	5.639262930701725

But due to depression now a days even girls are getting into its trap.	4.836322113426019

There is reduction in the ' mass ' that is the hardness in the bones , because of which the bones gets crunchy and the chance of them getting fractured increases.	4.452506751079753

This condition is called Osteoporosis.	7.2998853231549585

In some serious cases of this problem the person becomes absolutely disabled , and some can even die.	5.422030540708932

After analyzing the figures found through 23 projects in 8 countries the researchers found that due to depression the risk of bone loss was more in females than males , especially in young females before the termination of their monthly cycle.	3.9857937151554914

According to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre and other researchers the females who have the history of migraine a type of headache , they have 26 percent less chances of having breast cancer.	3.6139426348863797

This thing has been found out with a study done on the females undergoing the stage before menopause and the females who have crossed menopause.	4.4186315604185475

Regarding this along with paying attention to the habits in females like alcohol intake , smoking this was also paid attention to whether they are taking harmone therapy or not.	3.7338006089681386

The researchers could not precisely know what could be the realtion of migraine with the danger of breast cancer , but this is sure that in both the conditions there is a role of female harmone estrogen.	4.342862943094919

Through a recent research its revealed that if you are old and its in your habit to exercise , then your knees can have problems.	4.3240684581485205

Also you tend to have more probability of having arthritis.	5.1610819127268615

In this regard Christoph Statling associated with the University of California situated in San Francisco and the head of this study has to say that those figures which we have got in the study , indicate that those who do more of physical work , the danger of unevenness occuring in their knees is more.	4.133462038081466

Also the danger of osteoarthritis occuring is more.	8.928427773011103

Osteoarthritis is that degenerative disease of the joints , in which there is constant pain , swelling and rigidness in the joints.	5.71918858045832

As a result , his moving around is hampered.	5.316408204376753

Lakhs of people around the world are suffering from this problem.	6.2869919379653085

Accordind to a new research done in Sweden , those men who are unable to express their anger because of bad behavior with them in the office , the chances of them having a heart attack doubles.	4.416128662896928

To reach to this result the researchers estimated 2,775 such men in Stockholm , who have never had an heart attack.	4.037220676928535

These employees were asked how do they tackle the job related frustation ? 	4.058008267517213

They express their anger or bear quietly ? 	7.122649455237933

After the angst do they start haveing headaches or stomach aches ? 	4.602585832864562

Do they take out their work place frustation in home ? 	5.628258262141478

These employees were also asked about their drug habits - like intake of alcohol and smoking , education , disease especially diabetes , work pressure etc.	2.978947694839613

Besides this the blood pressure , body mass index and cholestrol level of the people involved were also taken.	4.391233287802185

The average age of all the people involved in the study was 41 years , when this study was started between 1992 to 1995.	4.144316586203352

The result of the study carried on till 2003 was that those men who were efficient in handling the pressure , compared to those men who beared up with their frustation had almost double the chances of dying due to heart attack or some heart problem.	3.5099129258615926

Not just narcotic drugs like cocaine , LSD , heroine adversely effect the brain , but the steroids having corticosteroids like prednisone , dexamethasone and hydrocortisone used to treat the disorders like asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , skin diseases and allergy also effect the brain adversely.	2.925982370962036

Result , the people taking the medicine can have decision making problems.	6.387026303884927

These can include - concentration problems , decreased activeness , not being able to remember the spoken words , not being able to register a thing or an incident for a long time in the memory.	4.055073604257916

The good thing is that after closing the intake of the medicines having corticosteroids the effect of many sideeffects reduces gradually.	5.191928445858958

Infact the effect of the above medicines can completely stop.	7.774245548204301

After closing the corticosteroids therapy of most of the healthy patients there memory became like it was earlier that is it became normal.	4.481915367535438

Fonterra and the University of Auckland has prepared such an amazing icecream , which has the quality of combating the side effects of the uncomfortable chemotherapy used as a treatment of the cancer patients.	4.759433986652758

What is the effect of this ice cream named as ' recharge ' on the diarrhea and anemia caused due to the chemotherapy , to know it the second stage experiments is being done in New zealand currently.	4.2103084748768875

Till now this much has been understood that this icecream along with curtailing the process of weight loss due to chemotherapy also reduces the damage happening to the immune system.	3.743773562670474

Till now the health experts knew this itself that during the treatment your body tend to absorb the medicine profusely with the intake of the juice of grapefruit , but the University of Western Ontario has claims that you should not take the juice of orange , apple or any other juice , because juice hampers the medicine to get absorbed completely.	3.7090218419820533

According to the head of the study David G Belli the safest way to take medicine is water itself.	4.403861262661789

The couple busy in the work and family responsibilities can have sex only after eleven in the night , whearas the truth is that the level of testosterone is at its peak in the morning , and the quality of the sperms is best in the afternoon.	3.507437104499695

And about the time for the females to get pregnant ,.	7.676554861962729

But the scientists are unable to understand till now whether in the case of successful concieving the time of the sex influences or not.	4.519182286847123

The delicious breakfast done in the morning provides you with energy all day , also it curtails your habit of eating more.	5.619385708612965

Actually our hunger is satisfied more with the morning diet as compared to the evening diet.	4.889619327770411

If we believe some of the studies then in the people getting up at the wee hours and early morning the attention , focus , vigilence and philosophical power is at its peak in the afternoon.	3.4639323190968985

Hence the works requiring a lot of mental consideration , do them in the morning and save the lighter works for the evening.	4.099398373694273

Although the mind of the youth remains sharp in the afternoon.	5.843807102009999

If you have certain teeth problem and you need to go to the doctor then take the time of only after the lunch.	4.766647830233439

First at this time the sensation of pain is less , second the effect of the anesthesia remains till long.	5.470058397660382

When the talk comes to the time of exercise , then do you also understand that the morning time is the best and the evening time is the worst for exercising ? 	3.8248262082280005

If yes , then think again.	6.740256265088255

The studies have revealed this that the people participating in sports perform better in the afternoons or in the evenings , because that time the temperature of your body remains high , there is more strength in the muscles , there is flexibility in the joints , the respiratory tracts are open and the heart too is performing its functions effectively.	3.9151110658042962

Towards the end of the day where the athletes are capable of the run , there even the swimmers swim with a comparatively fast speed during this time and the football players too give better performance during this time.	3.437621088535172

In case you want to burn more calories then do know this fact that the burning of calories is related not to the time , but to your physical constitution and metabolism.	4.253257633359699

Muscles burn more calories as compared to fat.	7.016861540425764

Your body temperature can have a variation of 4 degree farenheit , because the body temperature is 96 degree in the morning , which can go up till after the noon and rise to 100 degree.	4.600324799733586

Actually the temperature of your body affects everything ranging from your reaction to balance.	4.840018887459418

Medicines too should be taken on time just like the diet.	8.38924848206631

As an example the medicine of allergy works better when taken before going to bed.	5.102349443671926

With this you will get relief from the prominent symptoms of fever in the morning , like sneezing , running nose , itching in the eyes and lack of sleep.	5.022715734727225

Likewise if you take the pill of aspirin in the evening there would be a reduction in the stomach related problems.	6.4906220824566425

Do you have to complete some work in the afternoon ? 	6.575591620001316

Have to give a dinner party in the evening or participate in a race in the evening ? 	5.078099835197315

If yes , then take a nap from one a clock till three in the afternoon , when your body temperature drops then the vigilence starts to.	4.183849840419705

A little nap at this time will improve your mood , vigilence and memory.	4.7110869673391

This is said by of Sir Mednick PHD , who is a psycholgist in San Diego , University of California.	3.5724095417742476

According to him with this your productivity will ofcourse increase , you will also have menal and physical swiftness.	4.208819911244103

Coming to the question of the duration of the nap then that depends on what do you have to do.	5.067860133153884

Although delivery is not in your hands , but its important to know that during night the delivery pain is more.	5.424576888940407

Till now just this was said about cancer that it is like that charged arrow of the quiver , which can not be reverted back.	5.00519860705749

That means if it happens once , it would continue to grow.	4.6351726144030385

But the figures which have been collected for over two decades by the American Medical Association after screening the breast and prostrate cancer , they have raised questionary status on the earlier assumptions.	3.467499601610014

It was obviously seen in the study that tumor if not treated can become life threatening , but this thing came up too that the smaller tumors of the cancers even when they were not treated were not visible after some time during the screening or their development stopped on their own meaning they shrunked.	3.877393189704555

In some cases of breast cancer it has even been observed that the tumors disappear automatically.	4.359245018837277

The earlier perception concerning cancer was this itself that it is a long procedure , in this first the mutation starts in one of the cells that is alterations starts coming in its composition and function.	4.981819689856387

Then bit by bit it further goes on mutatingt and the mutation can never be reverted to the earlier normal state.	3.8556697752448157

The image of cancer is like an arrow , which goes on running to only one direction.	5.764086677745482

For cancer to flourish the suitability of other things is also essential besides mutation.	5.10070228031971

Those mutation cells require the support of their surrounding cells.	6.072302998155337

Cancer is fast occuring procedure.	9.336131362449123

The tumors of the testicles disappear.	9.027271235997343

Dr.Jognathan of the John Hopkins says that this does not happen usually , but this does happen.	4.638531715118638

It could be , that there is some knot in the testicles of some young man , but as soon as the doctors take out his testicles , only a mark of tumor is found there or else the tumor totally shrunk and became tiny.	3.82077117294855

In 95 percent of the cases this itself has been observed that after taking out the testicles the tumor disappears with passing time.	4.656384754056364

Or else if there is some big tumor visible near the kidney of some young man , then the doctors assume this itself that it erupted somewhere else , hence they try to locate it first.	3.6861643880206514

In this process they find a big mark on the testicles of that man , which is the only evidence of the original cancer.	4.371151771309107

There they get no tumor.	12.181489026094585

Generally the cancer of the testicles does not happen and other cancers mostly do not disappear , but now the evidence of this are constantly being found that cancer can return or else terminate.	3.748871354951945

Hence now the researchers are being pressurized that the earlier cancer related assumptions , they test them again and try to undersatnd what cancer actually is and how does its development takes place.	3.3324651603785855

Surely generally cancer does not disappear and nobody is giving this advise that on the basis of these few incidents the cancer patients stop getting their treatment.	4.1562793707889325

It is rarely seen that cancer would give the patient leniency after taking a serious stage.	4.865370056740739

But after knowing how cancer develops and how it sometimes disappears , it would definitely help the doctor to decide which tumor should be left like that and which should be treated.	3.7666107337745123

In most of the cases the doctors were not able to decide this thing.	5.341165949674011

The cells with cancer and those cells which would be converting into cancer cell , those are umpteen in every middle aged or old aged person.	3.781729784164873

This fact was known after the autopsy of those people , whose death took place due to other reasons and they did n't know before dying that they had cancer cells or the cells due to convert into cancer cells in future that are the pre cancerous cells.	3.2691967809483957

They did n't even have the complaint of any big tumor nor were there symptoms of cancer.	5.0950960715703415

Here this question is n't interesting that why do we have cancer , but this question is interesting that despite us having the cells that convert into cancer cells in the future why do n't we get cancer ? 	3.927384747284991

According to the researchers a simple cell approaching to convert into a cancer cell , its possible that it becomes normal again.	3.771018529830568

Understand it this way - those cells which are proceeding to produce cervical cancer , they all of a sudden revert back to the normal condition.	4.0475756020591955

In one of the studies it was known by doing a pep test that 60 percent of the pre cancerous cervical cells became normal within a year , whereas 90 percent of such cells took three years to become normal.	3.671566021283616

Today there is a talk of the rapidly spreading cancer , because with screening the cases of breast and prostrate cancer can be known in huge numbers in the early stage itself.	4.569025021934612

Due to lack of screening this was n't there earlier.	5.376148294442176

Now if it is believed that it is necessary for the early stage cancer patients to have a serious condition , then the number of the early stage patients after the screening should be equal to the number of the serious stage patients.	4.932765230142445

But this thing is n't observed in the screening of breast and prostrate cancer.	4.373706952737197

Hence people believe that many of the first stage cancers do not disappear.	7.200227861638091

Yes , some oblique evidences of the disappearance of breast cancer have been found.	6.322516390621483

But to say regarding the disappearance of prostrate cancer is difficult.	5.608397575538317

The researchers say that they doubt the concept that this cancer disappears.	4.551703612160456

But they do say this much that many cancers terminate after thriving in the body or their development happens way too slowly.	4.96125811543519

This thing has come up in many studies.	6.383123579960907

Here the number of people getting blind due to cataract itself is 20 lakhs and for around 25 lakhs of eyes cornea transplant is required.	4.096033992008212

But the dismaying thing is that such amount of cornea is not available in the country.	5.968473716603977

In our country most of the cases of blindness are in Jammu and Kashmir , Maharastra , Tamil Nadu , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.	3.04436538349183

The percentage of the problems related to the eyes in kids due to the deficiency of vitamin ' A ' is also a lot in India.	5.633405822280758

Because of this every year many thousands of kids tend to become the victims of untimely blindness.	4.197034279955755

55 percent of the total patients of cataract become blind due to the lack of proper treatment on proper time.	4.59028301858357

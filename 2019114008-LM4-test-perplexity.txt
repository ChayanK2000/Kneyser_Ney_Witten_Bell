That is for a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction how to identify the reaction mechanism it follows ?	43.60309014219196

Reacted is P and P is the conversion .	272.8264936660641

For visible light radiation , it depends on the polarizibilty of the medium polarization of the molecules or the particles which is scattering light or the one which the light is bombarded .	233.17580279230344

Now , how do you know ?	14.565747700455512

For example this is the material column and you feed the sample through a pump and you have a small heat exchanger which maintains in a very controlled range the inlet temperature and the outlet temperature is monitored by a thermister which is installed at the outlet end and this is connected to measurement circuit and measures the impedance .	485.5007629727636

The same expression , which I just showed in the last page , we can simply do mathematical rearrangement and get an expression something like this .	46.83140790970283

That means we simulate the value of v .	136.7027772108103

Third point we also develop S3 v3 .	178.81642938726148

Now , you know as a matter of fact that this does not exist as such independently because it exclusively exists at its tautomer of acetyl diode , but because this polymer looks like that it has been synthesized from a hypothetical monomer like this , this is this polymer is generally named as polyvinyl alcohol .	158.5659024146554

And it could be the polymerization could be done in an emulsion , now we will talk in more detail about this emulsion polymerization now .	66.53525168180646

So , remember , we talked about in step polymerization that the reactivity of the functional group present at the end of the oligomeric chain or a polymeric chain , does not depends on what is present in the other side , whether the other group is reacted , or what is the length the oligomer .	36.9154432373747

Similarly , as in case of ATIP reaction or reaction , where I 0 can be replaced by the raft reagent concentration and the beginning and again try other cases , we can utilize this raft reaction reversible addition , fragmentation transfer reaction for making block polymer at the end of the polymerization if we add a second monomer .	58.73997596272097

So , you have binodal points here and you have spinodal points here , like that you plot T 3 , and T 4 , and T 5 , and T 6 and so on .	107.33226585921834

So , polycarbonate will obviously become soluble in chloroform , it is 19.5 and 19.19 , 19.5 .	1378.8279685601901

Assume like in the first case that the enzyme possesses only one ionisable amino acid residues .	45.78642058613659

To illustrate schematically the same concept of a biosensor I have taken here a substrate molecule to be analyzed in any given system .	149.5732110783968

If it is this M n dot , which is the original propagations radical is more stabile , then obviously , this will be more preferred reaction over transfer reaction .	148.53637803141956

As I know as we know that high monomer gives high reaction rate .	129.24610465997847

So , if you plot the conversion , we plot the conversion with time as more and more active micelle form or the polymerization takes place in more and micelle more and more my micelles .	112.57425438125848

And the commonly these are called I will show you the example in the next slide , if you have CO these are called polyketones and specifically this structure is called poly ether ether ketones and simple this called polyether ketone , you have if you have a sulfonegroup SO 2 group in here then these are polysulfones .	360.78270918484793

For example , if I consider a case of halogen acids like HX and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond .	166.4813099899687

So , again , one more time let me emphasize , that if you , every temperature , every , your reaction , you can choose any temperature of your reaction and consider that as a ceiling temperature .	97.24409796884851

Another group of mechanisms that we will discuss are enthalpic factors .	71.74763291134165

So , K s c is basically the equilibrium constant between the concentrations or because of the partition of polymer molecules inside the pores and outside the pores .	59.585203427913385

In those cases another factor which we make use often for analyzing the reaction mechanism is the enzyme inhibition data .	162.65314899937454

Similarly , if you take a semi - crystalline polymer and heat it after the T g , the change in the polymer behavior is less compared to a pure amorphous , because they are part of the polymer material is amorphous ; part is crystalline .	81.06077821309908

While alanine racemase can act on either side of the reaction , it is a reversible reaction and therefore it can act on both L - alanine as well D - alanine .	147.27738535095602

Now , again in case of radical polymerization , it is little complicated because the molecular weight forms during defined times of polymers are different .	113.4400825869674

The characteristics of the bed can be theoretically numerically accounted by voidage what we call as a factor called epsilon which is the wide volume in the bed divided by the total packed bed .	255.31933272339978

And if we have groups like , acrylic acids , methacrylic acids or styrenic , which have a strong absorption , then this this this type of polymers actually help us in detecting the trace amount of residual monomers ; if the monomers are present , then it will give us from UV signal , UV - visible absorption signal for that monomers .	281.10953673612056

And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , I can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization .	40.15995495521597

Because each enzyme has specificity towards one of the isomers , substrates can be resolved into respective isomers .	834.0963623053879

So we just , one more time let us discuss .	63.32487216757491

The third item we have seen is the inhibition pattern which the kinetic reaction follows and probably another pattern which is very , very important in analyzing the immobilized enzyme reactors is the reactor type and operational stability .	125.56124192654964

Another important significance of the Michaelis Menten kinetics is its application to assay of the enzymes .	75.89973368846785

In this case we just talked about the propagation and initiation , propagation and the termination reactions , now there could be transfer reaction , chain transfer reactions as well .	31.705152510641415

In dilute polymer solution , we can assume the following reasonably well .	118.55505758481493

So , I can name M ; and also , we are drawing , write the summation of M i dot .	143.05771083425347

So , conversion is number of molecules reacted , number of function group reacted and the number of functional group originally present , so that is a fraction , that is a conversion , which gives you 2 by f average minus twice N by N 0 f average or twice f average minus twice X n f average because N 0 by N is your X n .	119.34506596451865

If you carry out the steady state reactor performance as a function of flow rate and determine the overall reaction rate constant based on the reactor performance , then you can determine by intercept 1 / ?	33.42482847850834

But the L L dash can be same or different ; from different metallocenes like Cyclopentadienyl or Indenyl or Fluorenyl .	583.3104216722672

So , if they can react inter molecularly and make a cyclic product , so if you talk about amino acid , it can form a cyclic product plus H 2 O .	90.98318120737093

l is less than one .	10.573059039622972

So , basically increasing reactivity ratios may not be different .	132.43880656130534

So , this is what is observed experimentally in this axis .	145.55977714853148

Now this can break into two species , let us write in the next page .	25.165905364805575

Now , will talk about copolymer form position , now in most cases what happened , because we are mixing M 1 and M 2 , and you are copolymerizing form there .	241.25999743173807

Light stabilizers are added as additive to eliminate or reduce the reactions in the polymers caused by visible or UV light radiation .	958.7386879858493

Now if I consider phi , as the intensity of the , or flask of the incoming light , and .	33.55493949659582

So , if you talk about length then , it will be change in length by total length typically , we express strain in terms of percentage .	183.22933475898148

Now , if that has to spontaneously phase separate in to in to two other composition obviously one has to be polymer rich and this one and other has to be solvent rich left hand side .	94.7019147250527

We , the effect of pressure is not that significant for addition polymerization .	100.37967609916788

So , this stability would be similar to stability of this radical .	88.3814814249707

I will stop here .	28.188769042190167

They are the ones which very heavily dictate the choice of the reactor ; whether to go for a plug flow reactor or to go for a batch reactor or to go for a continuous stirred tank reactor are very heavily dictated by mass transfer requirements and reaction kinetics .	59.29529666953341

So the form of substrate and form of enzyme will dictate the choice .	80.62443395417321

This is dead end .	106.91788415735513

I am just moving it fast , because this just information I my aim is to just give you the generic synthetic procedure for this class of step polymers .	299.9834737106757

This pathway is represented by this and this .	77.52730399806909

and also enzyme is very stable because it is experiencing the aqueous environment .	166.0147371533435

If the chain has same molecular weight but lower V h lower size for more compact coil which we can imagine for a applicable or which we will get for a branched polymer .	165.21088402114054

One more time F 1 is the mole fraction of the pre monomer in the reaction medium , and F 1 , capital f of upper case , is the mole fraction of M 1 , in the copolymer .	59.57016638284648

First thing happen is , surface scattering or reflection , and because of that there will be loss of intensity , of the light passing through the main material , and scattering from rough surface , also will lead to reduction in the clarity of the material , and of course , increase in the haze .	157.56938314263633

There are many other unfavorable interactions available at the active site and these interactions tend to distort the substrate in such a way so that it favors the formation of a complex which is analogues to structure in transition state .	30.827467632448283

So , you can understand that in this case , always the ends will have a functional group of A , which cannot react with each other .	45.51898666396986

So , I can write q for m 1 q for m 2 for 1 , 1 , 1 e m 2 , you can get the expression from k 1 1 for k 1 1 k 2 and so the ratio you get these two , this because is the same radical 1 and 1 .	209.2866863241993

They are identical in terms of confirmation .	98.34448414075686

So , if you look tri ethyl amine the value is higher for acrylonitrile than vinyl acetate .	128.49259418181757

Now , the second mechanism , which is a monometallic which is proposed by Cossee and Arlman .	213.25580929807103

So , in that case , chemist has to design the monomers such a way that the reaction , equilibrium reaction or equilibrium constant is higher .	29.7906821672145

We talk more about polymer crystallinity .	94.28317618757784

Now , it can be expressed , we have expressed earlier in two components , it contains two components ; one is enthalpic excess and more enthalpy and one excess and more entropy .	250.13090211008003

By now one thing you must have noticed that what we are considering here that when you are finding the probability p , we are just taking that the chance or the probability of one cell being vacant is the number of vacant cell divided by the total number of cells .	81.36504424544465

In x mar , the number of groups , a structure , x structure , also number of groups will be x .	256.6675648925781

The fatty acid or whatever lipid molecule you have used for making the micelle , they are arranged such that the hydrophobic heads are diverted inside which form a structure and tails are extruding outside and then you disperse it through the use of surfactant and you have an interface here consisting mainly of the hydrophobic tails which remains very stable in the organic medium .	424.75826652769973

Now , as we said the least energy would preferred around dihedron angle 0 and or both the sides , so in that case you can , this term would be more than one , so this term due to bond rotational restriction will be higher than the term , which was for the other end - to - end distance , where it has only bond angle restrictions .	80.66028749339074

Now , we can easily write other from this expression .	52.146593802008226

Number of initiator molecules can be used .	42.65150369846822

They are they do not change the T g with molecular weight .	29.042237923272115

Then another problem is instability to denaturation in biological fluids and proteolytic attack .	1051.8153979741446

For therapeutic purposes economics is secondary because primary is the ……… system , the safety of the system .	755.0932657720322

The slope also means the apparent km .	83.05174439402028

In today ’ s class what we will do , is to go through the other properties , like optical properties , electrical properties , barrier properties , and environmental properties , surface properties .	90.07970079089061

I think we will stop here and continue to discuss the behavior of enzyme reactors .	39.10439095158027

Obviously , the target application has to be kept in mind , which , for which application we want to use that additive .	107.18292896513415

These are the few examples of the ligands which are present in the metallocenes .	66.75089865285541

Now , this can also react with , or photo sensitize another molecule ; for example , if I have , from here , if I have another molecules , and if Ar is Ph .	142.74560611844362

The basic difference was while the lock and key mechanism or hypothesis proposed both the components to be rigid , in the Koshland induced fit model it was very clearly understood that the substrate may be rigid but the enzyme active sites are not rigid conformations as you can see here .	104.32679757983551

Before taking of the final design or analysis of the reactor system one need to look at the reactor performance equation based on actual reaction kinetics which is applicable and in this case I can site you the reference .	86.33219638225403

So it is a form of recycle reactor just like we saw in the case of total recycle packed bed which operates the batch reactor or even in continuous reactor recycle reactors can be used where part of the output stream is recycled and part is taken out as the product .	104.83001066347452

Typically , you have a pi bond , is converting to a sigma bond during this chain polymerization , or which is starting from a double bond .	35.6421199628632

So , if you can from the weight loss , we can get some idea about whether that this type of reaction is happening .	43.27406345067889

So , managing the heat , generate , generation or the heat generation during the polymerization is quiet not difficult .	684.308270785537

If you talk about the case , we just talked about say r 1 less than 1 and r 2 is also less than 1 , what will happen ?	21.96644012031287

The batch reactor can be used both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme.You can carry out a batch reactor in a stirred mode or in a packed bed mode with using total recycle and on the right hand side is the characteristic profile of the reaction species that is the substrate and product with reference to time .	53.58597057770726

This rate equation again has to be verified with more experimental data .	324.5337866651915

In case if the fraction of conversion required is very high if you are looking for a 99 % conversion , it will be desirable to use a plug flow reactor with a partial recycle .	28.9724985900935

This means you know also P which is close to 1 .	66.06702107758127

So , as a result the T g drops .	23.725281022597915

If suppose the carrier cannot be regenerated and it has to be replaced the replacement of carrier is much simpler in the case of CSTR .	44.77915953436463

sk1 does not form E .	438.6088673929798

It will be mixture of that , but average will be say , a dimer for an equilibrium constant of 1 and for an equilibrium constant of 10 to the power 2 order .	108.20573401482311

So , entropy of the polymerization is combination of propagation initiation , as well as , termination .	105.85326345596393

Now , you seen that it can be shown that the radius of gyration can be found from the r m s , root mean square , the r m s end to end distance ; and as I said earlier , the r m s end to end distance is useful for our elasticity and the radius of gyration useful for directly relevant to dilute solution properties and light scattering and it can also useful for branched molecules and cyclic molecules .	55.92798747959918

But in majority you know the major volume of polymer comes out in from the manufacturing plants , goes in the application where polymer is the major part you know , is a application of polymers is major .	298.4041418738255

So , so other protonic acids like H 2 SO 4 or say , HClO 4 or phosphoric acid .	1491.8495799428647

The dialysate removes the metabolites , urea in this case and the urea level in the blood is brought down , then the conventional way .	454.86403641634183

Then another area where probably cost or the process of economics is not important is the medical or therapeutic applications where the effectiveness is a very important aspect and in many cases even immobilized enzymes have found way in medical or therapeutic applications .	234.97408581009415

So , the concentration of the species , which is forming intra - molecular reaction , which is carrying out , which is undergoing intra - molecular reactions to form cyclic also come down .	53.883026875971574

The total sum will be the sigma on the denominator .	179.94222419104364

Now , these steps are part of propagation .	113.32235647157039

So , though this is a natural polymer , but if we imagine monomers like this from which they are formed and in this case because you imagine or you hypothesized that these are formed to a condensation reaction , most of this natural polymers are classified as a condensation polymer .	98.01608193876108

This is dissociation constant and KB and KA indicated here are the concentration of the substrates A and B respectively at which the reaction velocity is half the maximum reaction velocity at saturating level of the other substrate .	71.16667480281704

As far as the regulation of enzyme synthesis is concerned most of the enzymes are regulated entities .	60.712131955762665

The other analytical application sector was as a therapeutic agent and with development in the availability of different enzymes and particularly the understanding of molecular basis of deceases the use of enzymes as therapeutic agents is by and large increasing .	262.387384476286

Milk contains primarily lactose as a principle sugar and this lactose is an undesirable sugar for certain adults .	6578.031445869121

This is only one of probably a large number of relationships that are reported in the literature of heterogeneous catalysis in chemical engineering .	89.73064301508893

So , if you compare between the , within the , let me write down , write down these things , so in a polar solvent you have , say contact .	95.29180059193789

We will discuss the techniques like membrane osmometry , vapor pressure osmometry , and end group analysis .	47.40271109769821

You get a high , very high molecular polyethylene .	22.660157751013234

So , you can use ultem as your material ; obviously , these polymers are costly , because they have , so high performance and they are also difficult to synthesize there are the same time much costlier then the common polymers .	214.20571347531595

If you decrease the temperature , now whether that also simultaneously increases the rate of the polymerization that depends on the value of the activation energy for reactions .	68.12891304047254

But ultimately this cycling is not continuous over a long period of time and that is still inherent problem .	182.53579054832485

So , in this case , this two moles of chain which underwent disproportionation reaction , you have total number of , this has each one has one residues initiator residues and this has two initiator residues .	140.98465533429044

Pure monomer is getting converted to a pure polymer which is completely amorphous or slightly crystalline .	98.48292604538108

So , polymerization does not take place in the monomer droplet , actually if you stop the reaction after sometime , you will find that less than 1 percent , actually less than 0.01 percent polymerization polymerization happens in the monomer droplet .	98.52192075899669

Now , typically E transfer is higher than E p , so which means , that with T , with increase in , decrease in temperature C also goes down , which means , X n goes up .	77.1137736169567

In fact in many cases in the chemical analysis detection of D - amino acid is difficult because it gets destroyed .	101.6661971508868

By knowing the two slopes one can calculate klam .	656.5934804494183

So , you have much larger or broader molecular weight polymers .	97.57204150874392

So , it basically purify the blood and also pump into the body .	305.92770317291416

So what we will have , we will have a composition drift , which means the copolymers which form at the beginning they will have different composition , than the copolymers which are forming at the later part of the copolymerization reaction , so is have so you can understand that the monomer content in the copolymers will be different , then the feed ratio at the beginning , and with time the monomer composition will be different , from the beginning , and there will be composition drift .	59.28494433713603

Another source of non - ideality could be that the reactor may have some kind of dead zone because of the improper mixing and this dead zone is V.f2 .	252.0356075524069

What is the structure microstructure of the polymer , and also most important is what is the molecular weight of the polymers which we made , and what are the as you know that polymers seldom have unique ; all the polymers chains have same molecular weight .	62.492157952576214

And those are the same types of initiators will be used to basically polymerize the cyclic rings and make a ring opening polymerization .	64.19882871569011

And as we discussed it will give you a syndiotactic polymer , syndiotactic methyl methacrylate .	50.22443284859462

So , this is in a actual case if the rate of polymerization depends on the conversation , now obviously this gel effect whether it will exists or if exists at what conversion that will depend upon the viscosity of the medium .	98.9758924078691

This 2 path is shown here .	136.30126277741624

A large number of correlations giving the values of C and n have been proposed under different conditions and one of them which needs the actual reaction conditions can be chosen from the literature and used for estimation of JD .	107.82412632944398

Even in chemical engineering that is very conventional thing ; only difference is that those catalysts are very , very stable interms of their thermal , operational as well as storage stability where as immobilized enzymes are not as stable .	260.9695034949282

Typical substrate binding energies range from 3 - 12 kcal mol - 1 .	690.748073067107

That means magnitude by which the dissociation constant of binding of inhibitor is modified can be determined .	42.64820109923876

So , the contour length would be multiplied this by the number of bonds .	55.53183842569899

And if they are well separated , obviously , there will not be any possibility of such type of intermediate formation and hence as usual the trans product will be predominant .	29.171988553221016

One is the transport of substrate from the surface to the enzyme active site and then reverse will be transport of product .	39.71724032748003

Now , if we talk about the big polymer manufacturers like DuPont , Dow Chemicals , SABIC , Bayer they are manufacturer of polymers .	922.1147752464507

You have to take the monomer and a initiator which is soluble in the monomer .	34.726511928271776

So , just recap last 2 lectures , we discussed in detail effect of temperature on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight .	26.51708602122505

These enzymes are often involved in many of the constitutive functions of a living cell where the cell wants a very broad specificity and thatís why the nature has evolved these group specific enzymes .	132.16149636010596

Like in the case of lipase or protease , water can be the second substrate or it could be the second substrate itself to yield the desired product .	153.1498157935947

So , if you increase the conversation that may be more and more polymer forming less and less monomer present in the medium then means the T g of the polymer present is becoming higher and higher because you are reducing the amount of monomer present in the media .	55.3250138160668

So , this is a cis product .	11.613781809668993

So , these all are very easy to name in our conventional way as polyethylene terephthalate .	124.10249561435513

Except for that difference there will be no difference and the reaction profile will be hyperbolic in nature and one can examine such a situation in the case of a variety of identical independent subunits .	63.938726700271076

So , basically we are talking about pendent group size , we are not talking about this , we are talking about pendent group size and type .	21.63574721754494

So therefore the tow the space velocity or the space time can be given by the same design expression which was used for idealized enzyme reactors excepting that the effectiveness factor for a case has been multiplied to the system .	103.10026349372653

And here stress is linked to the rate of change of strain with time , and the proportionality constant is the viscosity .	105.29113633972271

Now , if you consider even higher theta value and you consider a theta like this which is higher than theta two then the phase difference between the two scattered light is even higher .	57.08715252287448

The M 1 will get incorporated in the chain at a much faster rate .	17.29406007589655

That means equilibrium constant is the one where the rate of forward reaction and the backward reaction are identical and the equilibrium constant the value of the concentration of product upon substrate at v = 0 will be Keq = [ P ] eq / [ S ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 or in terms of the basic kinetic parameters Keq = [ P ] eq / [ S ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 = vs.kp / ks.vp The expression can be arrived from the main rate expression which will give you the equilibrium constant either in terms of the rate constant .	63.21729231114074

So , this is the expression for theta equals to c is equals to 0 .	10.84718392174712

The effect of pH is linked to the ionization state of the enzyme active site .	15.682302333858035

So , even if you stopped at the very beginning with a very low conversation at say 5 percent , you see high molecular weight , polymers , monomers and the initiator in the medium .	74.14700447715902

So this is also another set of monomers , which can be easily polymerized , by a anionic initiator .	11.961047348587265

I will cover in brief the reaction of polymers which include polymer degradation , stabilization and also polymer modifications and at the end I have planned to brief you about few new topics , and special topics and new development in polymer chemistry and at the end I will complete with a summary of this course .	307.00047608858307

These are three possibilities , this is not happened very practically , but these two are very common in practice .	236.75611753365254

Or on the other hand if the biochemical reaction rate is very , very slow compared to diffusion or diffusion is very fast you might have a reasonable concentration of substrate even at the centre of the particle and therefore the apparent loss of enzyme activity may not be serious .	46.59511354338016

So , how to get the value for M v ?	12.527398440529343

If you can think of that the next carbon also have same configuration and if they alternate , then they are called syndiotactic , this is isotactic and if there is no order , then it is called atactic which is basically random distribution .	143.83175399811404

if you increase the time the polymer molecular weight will be higher and higher .	24.802119259345524

Styrene , you get polystyrene .	736.2125039288679

Had this reaction not been reversible totally then the term p will become zero , irreversible reaction .	1176.2079591838606

It has been de linked from its natural habitat and when we take an enzyme sample in a buffer , its natural structure function may not be identical as it happens in the living cell and that has been recognized very well .	199.0219019323899

The antibodies and enzyme molecules in terms of their dissociation constant for their counter part in the case of enzymes it is substrate in case of anti bodies , they are antigens .	130.50196322710855

The Km apparent , if you consider K ’ m as Km apparent varies with the hydrogen ion concentration .	77.76405889972497

Now , let us , we know , that at different state of aggregation we have discussed earlier , that this ion - pairs present in different state of aggregation forms a tight ion - pair to solvent separated ion - pair to completely free ion - pair .	58.771696026163475

And the rates the rate materials , in terms of different , this gives the different ratings like V 0 V 1 V 2 H B and those things .	486.4882491719419

As I said in the first class itself that structure units and repeat units are different , and it will become more clear , I just give 2 examples .	47.719754407083144

This temperature has mainly three consequences ; one is the optimum temperature of the reaction .	131.09149028316875

And the , now let us talk about the third type of initiation , which is that photo initiation or photo chemical reactions , photo initiation .	83.34985794421148

That means certain functional group on the substrate will bind to certain active sites and the active sites will have certain catalytic sites which will interact with the functional residues on the substrate molecule which has to undergo change , the bonds that has to be broken .	40.55183179533436

So , at the one more time , at the end of stage I you have large monomer droplets stabilized by the absorption of surfactant molecules of course , the this size has sunk from the beginning , you have the initiator molecules still present in the in the solution , you have monomer molecules as well .	53.484021666160984

In this case chloride ; there , their interaction with the monomer ; steric and electronic interaction with the monomer actually determines the orientation of the coordination monomers .	105.64067040977216

They are proven to hydrolyze .	275.7970008638901

There will be no biasness of M 1 sitting next to M 2 , or M 1 seating next to M 1 .	233.75786430376462

So , these are basically block copolymers , which have a long sequence of two different monomers .	81.01013962914571

Vander Waal forces the attractive forces resulting from favorable interaction between dipoles is a very important component in the conformation of a protein .	329.24915820910314

They are presenting the maximum number , but its weight reach matters most , not the number in terms of polymer property is .	537.8767621382982

That means if it is a three enzyme species system , if there are three enzyme species in the system then each path way must consist of two steps which can form the enzyme species E or any enzyme species which we are considering .	42.34359941893931

Now , there are other step there are several other step polymers , which you know because of time or this course of this polymers is not to go through the detailed synthesis procedure of this polymers .	100.26400403778901

And between e and f this is the change of slope , sorry this is slope and this is the rate of change of slope this change of is coming in positive direction here , and negative direction here .	208.8269386285524

For example , if I take a… This again coming back to the example of polyester .	50.10877043171829

It does not come back to the original state , or end there is not any recovery at all , so this is a perfect viscous material .	33.47936579895863

A major application sector is industrial catalysis whereby we replace a chemical catalyst for carrying out a chemical transformation to produce a desired product .	398.13050217607616

I write this as AA and this as BB .	186.2764575929972

So within a limited pH range at which the right kind of amino acid residues are ionized the native confirmation of the protein is maintained .	81.77864075109817

So , you want the polymer material to be behave as barrier to that perfume whatever is there inside .	395.40369760914547

So we will discuss this process in coming pages .	33.470006873776825

Thus the product has to come back from the reaction site to the surface and then to the bulk .	93.37186591675142

So the net effect on the maximum reaction rate is experienced .	65.28447995272151

Another example of a competitive inhibitor is sulfanilamide which is a sulpha drug .	66.54549266551281

And compare this vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate , which is basically as we have known from our earlier discussions done in several times .	218.2383568345602

This is very true very often in the case of reversible reactions and in such cases the Michaelis Menten kinetics will also be valid provided the interconversions of the intermediate complexes are the rate limiting step .	77.93661911333683

So , we can analyze the amount of dyes present , we can also analyze specialized additives which are , where the additives are UV visible active .	258.57048587981774

So , if the polymer while vaporization is gets fragmented or degraded then while we get the molecular ion distribution , we do not know the distribution is because of the fragmentation or degradation of the high polymer chain or because of the actual presence of the low molecular weight chain in the samples .	173.58624603134425

Now the confirmation or the configuration of the polymer chain will be determined by the confirmation of the adding monomer which the monomer which is getting added .	52.59514938826263

And then went randomly , did a random of fixed step length of one length , and then using radial distribution function Gaussian , what is the probability that the other end would be at a distance r from the origin .	110.55063344574833

The aggregates will be insoluble and they can be used as immobilized preparation which can be readily separated from the lipid phase .	188.47917524202305

so in this case the entropy change is also lower , so if you think about the thermo dynamics of this chain polymerization , briefly , at this movement , because this is exothermic negative , and this is also negative , so there is a completion between these two term .	82.73772905466691

Whereas 6 member ring is not that feasible to or basically it is not feasible to polymerize thermodynamically .	156.22261140752974

And they are jointly awarded the Noble prize in Chemistry .	3017.804460782858

Whereas this correspondence to , the 80 percent of free monomer M 1 in the reaction mixture , while this is correspondence to 80 percent of the monomer aim in the co polymer .	43.85905198567719

So , again this is meaning , this means that if you want to build a high molecular weight , always better to take out the condensate out from the system .	25.51937864755777

I will give you a specific example .	18.17571083624059

It consists of stirred reactor in which silicon tubing is dispersed into the organic phase and silicon tubing , while it is non - porous to most of the substrates and the products , but it is porous to water vapors and what we do is through silicon tubings we recirculate a saturated salt solution which is known to have a definite water activity .	354.06186523929586

For step polymerization , this is very important because it will end up in most cases , PDI is 2 .	86.89838879026614

Because , the number of micelles are much more huge compared to the monomer droplets , obviously even though the sizes of the micelles are smaller than the monomer droplets , the total surface area or the micelles are considerably higher compared to the total surface area of the monomer droplets .	53.52896329166713

For example is example of metallocenes , where you have two side ; two cyclopentadienyl coordinated with , attached with iron .	791.492679145966

So , how this is possible ?	44.620704872058525

As soon as the binary complex forms a product is released and the modified enzyme then interacts with the second substrate and the second product is formed .	33.45497478042309

Once the substrate binds to one of the binding sites in some cases the binding site might induce a conformational change thereby making the affinity of the substrate molecule to the other binding sites more favorable or some times unfavorable .	80.29310658667173

That means the sizes of the polymer chains are smaller .	28.129818323245654

Monomers , we talked about several times monomers .	334.1556063957619

So , now what we will do is we will explain or we will try to learn how the Paul Flory , Huggins theory was established using that same lattice theory which we just learnt for small molecules .	79.44817798436351

That was the only assumption .	185.2662917001673

Welcome to this seventh lecture of this course on polymer chemistry .	26.451958369317996

If I take the axis , the carboxylic group , what will land up in ?	98.77220608717896

So , this is this molecules even if they are thermo dynamically feasible they do not undergo polymerization .	30.645755759920668

So , in the expression of this m V we just found out that it is having the expression of this .	48.632520569703175

Because the carriers are functionalized they are attached with the protein and when enzyme confirmation is lost protein is still coupled to them in the deactivated form .	517.1702473742698

So , light stabilizer must ; basically we talked about 2 types of light stabilizer - one , which can absorb the UV light and protect the bulk of the polymer from UV light ; and second we talked about HALS , which basically prevent the oxidation process or the radical process , and prevent the molecular weight degradation .	94.77176422519776

Experimentally you cannot determine the vm value because it is a saturation rate asymptotic to the axis and therefore you can never reach that value experimentally .	195.20606475253814

We will talk about the simplest model , which is known as terminal model .	54.412613425748006

Now what mean by chain dimension ?	140.53624789078592

These are the different techniques and what I have done is I have just listed the principles and some of these techniques are absolute techniques ; that means we do not require any calibration by the polymers of no molecular weight .	94.2843375999877

That is the order which it goes and it is a fairly large range .	125.08874138081727

So , if you stop the reaction in the beginning , you will see a lot of these high conformation conversion , but a lot of these small oligomers .	47.30362392828283

Only then it depends on the magnitude of time .	65.34754154780178

I try to write this one using the same you will arrive at for the same expression as Michaelis Menten equation .	91.54159125689445

If the enzyme loading is constant , then the tau will also have the similar ratio because in our reactor performance equation the left hand side is K2E0 ?	77.34150854745542

And to maintain the same temperature the heat or energy is supplied to the sample .	57.45967204314767

Let us say a substrate has to undergo reaction which has three functional group represented by Rí , Ríí or Rííí .	101.81887202706064

The reason that we cannot get the calibration curve made for all the polymers , because we cannot get narrow dispersed polymer for all types of polymers ; specially , for coordination polymers , for polycarbonate polyesters , polyamides that is very difficult to synthesize narrow dispersed polymers which SPI is 1.1 or less than that it is very difficult ; and unless we have a narrow dispersed or mono dispersed samples which can be retry standards we cannot use this for calibration .	152.0595718560081

Things like O 2 , CO 2 , they actually inhibit the anionic chain polymerization by forming a peroxyl , peroxyl or carboxyl anion , which are very weak nucleophile , which cannot reinitiate a new anionic chain , so these are inhibitors .	718.8147795961311

If your environmental pH is alkaline , seven plus , the isomerisation can take place naturally and the isomerisation product will not be only fructose but it will be plus few other hexoses which will be produced and the whole advantage of using an enzymatic process is lost .	456.69928563523564

So , we can write n i , this is M I .	24.47441241168913

But enzyme loss can be there big time , over a long period of time .	153.50779420943095

So , as a result more complicated products actually form when there is type of hydride shift or some cases methide shift , some cases shift one two methide shift .	656.7639521318458

So , basically that will give us some idea , if we keep that polymer material at that particular temperature for long time , as especially in elevated temperature , where there is some degradation or decomposing happening or not .	228.1908705514943

One of the sides is blocked .	14.004573327185547

km k2 E + S E S E + P + I ki EI Then the same free enzyme molecule binds to the inhibitor and gives you EI .	73.01530088418336

Now , in this crystal as I said , this is a octahedrally coordinated .	115.62468339667997

If you know k and a ; if k and a are known , obviously you can find experimentally the value of intrinsic viscosity and then if you know k and a value , then you will be able to find the value for M v .	28.50997882523855

No . It cannot form a peptide bond .	215.44366205454008

Because of the nature of certain non - polar side chains to drift away from the water molecule , which in the case of an enzyme solution is usually water , it causes the non polar side chains to burry inside the core .	101.24027370044085

A major application of immobilized cells has been in isomerisation of glucose to fructose and the process is only techno economically viable because it can be used in the form of immobilized cells .	96.31086334395823

So , that is the root mean square end to end distance .	4.225620511389177

And from that we can get the values of m , this one m m , r and r r .	32.03458531592038

So , if you have ring stability order , then you have 3 member rings , 4 member ring .	371.1004107912596

So , now , we basically know these are the mechanism of Zeigler - Natta polymerization .	31.36098581206247

All variety of those functions at a molecular level has become an added dimension which has been at the center of the bio technology in general .	177.24120653600838

It will be expressed in the cyclic form by a triangle each enzyme species represented on the vertex of the triangle and each of the path way which should be considered for the formation of enzyme species must have n - 1 steps .	133.54031922722584

There are mainly two motivating factors .	211.70446408654362

Now , how can you think of which one is dominant product or which one is not a dominant product ?	127.22966967343329

One of the important aspects is that unlike synthetic macromolecules which we are familiar in our day to day life say polythene or styrene they are all linear chain molecules , long linear chain molecules , hydrocarbon residue of monomers .	816.4637957801154

If you talk about the molecular at the beginning of the reaction , that is quite different than the molecular weight of the polymers which are at the end of the reaction .	14.458425572757047

So , it is always your solvent or the mediums should be such that your function groups are always accessible , should be always accessible to react .	286.4529623585359

The mechanism and the kinetics in case of emulsion polymerization do not follow a normal chain reaction polymerization kinetics or mechanism , as was the case for the earlier 4 , 5 process , we just talked about this mechanism and kinetics for emulsion process are quiet different and complex , and still not completely understood .	199.5277930897531

You see the particles shown here ; let us say a kind of a spherical particle not perfectly sphere but something which can be assumed to be spherical and with a network of pores within the particle and the enzyme is located while on the surface as well as on the bulk of the enzyme .	158.13250992088436

So , the molecules , now we just talked about this theoretical number or this expression for this simple polyethylene molecule ; now if you have side groups obviously , this rotational restriction will be higher , because the polymer will be much more stiffer than polyethylene molecules , so rotational restriction will be higher .	98.41799936380565

Here we require the value for delta H molar heat of vaporization and with the help of cryoscopy which deals with the depression of freezing point where we can get the same T 0 T f ; T 0 is the freezing point of the solvent , T f is the freezing point of the solution where we need the molar enthalpy of freezing or melting .	179.35210202325544

Then obviously , in any given opportunity , the polymer will try to release that stress , and one opportunity of its come contact with the chemical , it might release that stress , by cracking or crazing and so on .	297.7300520705309

Now , we the stiffness can be also measured by , if you get this term , this term is basically the ratio of the unperturbed dimension divided by the dimension for a freely rotating chain .	55.898768628247645

The two equations which you can apply , this T g is for the resulting co polymer , or the blend , visible blend , which is given by W 1 T g 1 plus W 2 T g 2 .	131.7735420004218

We also saw that the active site will include the binding process .	47.18876405395734

So , if you just look at this curve one more time , the melting is a first order transition , where G varies with temperature , the x - axis is the temperature , with G varies continuously with temperature and the first derivative of G , V , H , S , they varies discontinuously .	124.22210624222865

And r is the fraction of pairs of adjacent of repeat units that are present in syndiotactic geometry .	65.17731072832208

If in this case , A is the functional group present in a smaller quantity , the fraction of a group which has reacted is defined as the conversion .	30.39800019410199

If you have a molecules which have only one functionality for example , instead of ethylene glycol you have a phenol molecules , then once this weights of phenol is reacted you , the chain does not goes , you you cannot make a polymers .	145.14919474664913

Now , if we take say an ideal copolymerization where r 1 r 2 is 1 if r 1 is higher than 1 and r 2 is less than 1 , then 2 monomers will get into the chain in random fashion , but monomer M 1 will be entering in the chain at the faster rate as compared to M 2 .	100.49098776139974

So , this is expected that at low conversion the polydispersity will between 1.5 to 2 .	104.49759762414988

In the lab , there are more sophisticated statistical method and which are computerized .	395.3036232377579

They could be on the same site where the substrate binds or even they could be on a site in proximity of that or in such a way that the binding of the substrate is influenced .	53.26922990575796

But if you consider the overall productivity of the immobilized enzyme that means the yield of the immobilization after considering the operational stability it still remains a desirable method .	98.80843227308976

When I say catalyst that means not all proteins will qualify to be called enzymes .	272.00457369687854

So , in this case ethylene oxide you must put a bracket that the monomer inside the bracket and then prefix the term poly .	59.605264429711774

R O P by name as the name suggests it is a ring opening polymerization , so you have ring in monomer having ring structure and you polymerize it , and make a linear polymer .	131.51544350386672

There could be some peroxides or hydro peroxides , which also when act as a initiator , they participated in chain transfer reaction and resulting decrease of molecular weight , example of X A is monomer methyl methacrylate dot , it is not the methyl methacrylate .	219.71157174579236

With that concept he was able to determine the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex formation .	36.66775577583985

So obviously you have to produce them on a very small scale and producing on small scale will lead to high cost of production .	100.23093278199217

In the case of PET .	22.67057108406065

So , you need to know the concentration of each monomers very well .	34.20342237863278

It operates almost like a packed bed system .	114.36754607287551

Next we will consider desirable operational parameters .	196.783855085997

Now obviously if these two blocks , in a block co polymers or say two homopolymers in blends are partially visible , then what happens , you still gets two T g s , for a two component system , but if T gs comes down from the corresponding homopolymers , you get a somewhere intermediates .	244.86894824141856

The two major attributes of an enzyme molecule is the chemical nature of the protein and their catalytic function .	54.25695338045465

So , we will talk about kinetic .	17.035735702382485

X.S0 is the total product formed and tau is the space time per unit time , the amount of product formed per unit time .	64.57569353761656

Starch hydrolysis also shows a similar behavior ; gelatinous it is not insoluble like particulate matter , but still it is in the form of a gel and after you cook the starch you get a gel and the gel has to be reacted with the soluble enzyme to carry out the liquefaction .	180.98139366795195

Vs is the maximum reaction velocity corresponding to substrate .	281.9653769251303

Now , we can extend these examples .	124.53642135268808

And this is these are the trade names of this polymers in this trade name they are sold Radel and Udel .	108.03322586368749

For example , you take specific example of amines , they can react with this propagating species and form a complex , such in this case this cationic species is very stable and they are nonreactive towards the monomer .	108.94330416822598

So , that is , what is the chance that each segment would be giving up a polymer solvent contact .	21.76487164545166

There are hundreds of such examples I can give , maybe I will give in later classes , but I hope you are convinced that polymers is finding applications in several places and now a days when we talk about you know we , a scientist or the developer you know application specialist with thing for a new material application .	230.33431295405097

KE * = K * .	49633.62873837838

So , now we have this vacant orbital .	87.54558452467349

Now , there could be other points which are also having the same distance r ; you can have other values r across this three d coordinate .	160.38691618226903

That means that becomes almost similar parameter like what you considered in case of a soluble enzyme that is specific activity .	126.74940510713995

The basic concept is you have to choose an appropriate combination of biological and transducing elements that means choose a biological agents ; we are emphasizing on immobilized enzymes which will recognize the anylate .	295.3544546547824

F1 that is the line corresponds to F 1 is f 1 .	147.726474674904

The reaction may stop as soon as some concentration of the product and hydrogen ions are built up .	191.99699028053152

Because this is constant , this is constant .	60.01603894395418

Reactor performance from RTD also can be obtained and one can compare if you consider the ideal reactor flow profile and also the real reactor flow profile and compare their performance and comparison will give you the deviation from the ideality .	211.82253689312049

Most important non covalent interaction which involves in the conformation of the protein molecule is hydrogen bonds , very large number of hydrogen bonds .	109.72741400977762

Because , the concentration of monomer also goes down , concentration on initiator also goes down , but as the concentration initiator goes down faster than the monomer , so effectively the monomer molecular weight increases .	145.82890476396028

R p 1 is given by k p 1 , M 1 dot , M plus , R 2 is given by k p 2 , M 2 dot , M plus , so on ; and , this R p n is given by k p n , M n dot , M .	14.258912327905449

So , basically , trap the radicals and form non radical process , and by which they prevent degradation of molecular weight , and formation of the yellow colour bodies .	47.14652479870435

Typically , we present a polymer distribution at weight fraction versus molecular weight .	82.96414986949549

The concentration of any specie of a reaction system is homogeneous same at every point in the reactor and that is equal to the concentration at the product stream because it is a perfectly mixed system .	54.71257428944537

So , the size of this monomer is becoming smaller and smaller , and will vanish at the end of stage II , so at the stage II you have only this particles , no surfactant , free surfactant micelles , neither you have free droplets .	315.2442204450824

So this gives you a picture of the process economics and the contribution of different factors in the operation of an immobilized enzyme processes .	37.87949581160959

An initiation consist of 2 steps : 1 - initiator molecules produce 2 radical species , which is the initiating radical or is called the primary radical .	227.44254014454523

Now we will discuss , or define this term , clarity and haze in a minute .	95.5178929537165

Of course if you have a cationic then you have an anionic counter ion .	20.85163207713821

That means if you take a soluble enzyme , add to a carrier and allow it by any method of immobilization we get two streams - one will be residual enzyme activity in the supernatant which is left uncoupled and immobilized enzyme preparation .	82.6541970292835

The other important polymers in this family is poly chloride .	170.0870797917727

So , if you have prior knowledge of your solubility parameter of the polymer and solvent then you can narrow down the polymers , before you go the exact trail .	147.06575058923525

This A and B both have to colloid and make an unstable compound .	258.37393780579964

The kind of kinetics the reaction follows dictates very often the choice of reactor types , the design parameters for the reactor and they all involve enzyme kinetics and that becomes quite important tool for reactor design .	158.96053898184698

If you look at these numbers here , k P k d to the power half k t to the power half , here k d is in the down .	39.94333669618384

In the case of polystyrene this is repeating unit and this is also a structure unit because structural units is the unit which is derived from a monomer .	50.448574205241435

Obviously one tribu butyne has much more stabilization .	239.76782772818137

We have also not considered the deactivation of the enzyme on the reactor performance .	15.248552262962441

While in the case of PFR or the plug flow reactor the regeneration of the carrier is simple because after the immobilized enzyme is exhausted one can stop for a while regenerate the carrier , reimmobilize the system and reuse .	108.00239467744045

k2 / Km is a combined parameter for the biocatalysis but D is a diffusional parameter so it is physically some parameter which defines the ratio between the two and by adjusting either numerator or increasing or decreasing the numerator or the denominator one can regulate the controlling parameter .	389.7192550872039

l value greater than two F is approximately 1 / ?	210.4758493185472

That means that the rate will increase rate of polymerization will be , will increase with increase in temperature .	24.434563987871822

So , it will have much lower del H value .	13.34953508643293

So , what is done in practice ?	19.456139612791688

All this mechanical properties depends on temperature of experiment , and the strain rate or the stress rate .	72.18690433917986

When I say cheap I am referring to comparable cost of other enzymes and therefore it is used usually in soluble batch process at a very high temperature because the alpha amylase is a very thermo stable enzyme and can be operated at temperatures even hundred plus and therefore the gel gets immediately liquefied .	283.99802457114583

Now , what happened in case of polymer ?	9.468778561026179

In this lecture thirteen , we plan to cover effect of temperature on rate of polymerization and molecular weight , and also we will start our discussion on thermodynamics of chain growth polymerization .	28.42421663233629

The molecules have to reach to this state of the energy so that the transition state can form and then it can be broken down to form the enzyme and the product .	42.51430272569141

So , every real polymer chain will have restriction of bond angle and also restriction for the single rotation around the single bond .	66.72315301530797

So , what you need so you need a hetero atom in the ring in the cycling wave , which we have a ring like say ether molecule see this ether or a ester or say a amide they might can do there is if you use asilo base they can actually do nucleophilic or electrophilic attack on this ring and reopen .	355.8299548210506

But this is not common ; this is especially applicable to some monomers .	230.64204465527533

Now a solution in the solvent , chemical potential is lower than in the solvent so the vapor pressure of the solvent in the polymer solution will lower .	38.52888900217319

A number of enzyme catalyzed reactions have been reported like lipases for ester synthesis , interesterifications , transesterifications and resolution of racemic mixtures .	177.98739607504396

So , yield strength and the elastic modulus is becomes higher , if it is a flexible back bone obviously , reforming deformation is much easier so , modulus comes modulus come down .	281.80814046299145

So , like this curve , no matter what is your r , you can only reach up to this level .	32.982592868545986

So basically , only… what is the change here ?	121.26219185665371

The reaction velocity for such a reaction will be given by v = k3 ( ET ) – k - 3 [ E ] .	55.24791669284904

That means substrate concentration is almost hundred fold or more than the Km value .	33.690870215909335

And at some temperature , this deformation happens , and that particular temperature is known as heat deflection temperature .	98.40291858097184

At a value of pH which is lesser than pK value of the ionisable residue , the Vm remains constant and at its original value .	78.85744135563185

Say , at low conversion that means at the beginning of the reaction low conversion X n bar is given by 1 by 1 minus P X w n given by 1 plus P 1 minus P and X w bar X n bar P D I given by 1 plus p .	41.07828083050784

Proper amount of loading : sometimes this additives function for a particular level of loading ; too less loading or might not be bring about the advantage which are the manufacturer looking for ; and too much of addition of the additive might destroy the polymer itself , and obviously , the cost of the formulation will go up .	456.8526328601253

klam kí2E0 Sb We have two different conditions of the Lineweaver Burk plot ; one in the case where Sb is very high and the Lineweaver Burk plot will have the slope as Kím / Vím On the other hand when the substrate concentration is very low the slope will be 1 / klam + Kím / Vím .	57.204418244768156

When this is C H 3 , if you have C H 3 group , the polymer chain becomes more stiffer .	60.69094829020683

You will get a fraction say 3.4 or 3.6 .	78.9593089583308

You know packaging films you have seen probably that when you stretch at the beginning , it takes a little difficult .	390.39435848867754

Polymers as I said , it is never , the polymer crystallinity is not never up to hundred percent , it is always up to semi - crystalline .	166.2461339869177

This is a process flow diagram that is still in operation in Japan and has been in operation since 1963 , the first system which came into being and is still being operated .	773.8534584968503

So , basically , these are the attributes , surface active additives must have to be successful in any application .	94.70778892689925

As in the very first reaction itself for example hexokinase will act on glucose as a substrate and produce the corresponding phosphorylated sugar .	70.57747672312556

The additives must be chosen , keeping in mind the chemical composition of polymer ; their additive must be comparable ; in the sense , that it should not react with the , with the polymer itself or it should not make harm to the polymer itself , which will deteriorate the polymer property .	101.99948646513069

This is poly acrylamide gel entrapment .	21.115463375957653

We come across variety of analytical situations whether in the area of research or even in the area of clinical analysis where the samples are analyzed in large numbers and be required to use very specific reactions that can be catalyzed by enzymes .	184.5002942728881

They can regenerate the carrier as and when the enzyme activity comes down ; even they can dissolve ; they can re - adsorb it and the carrier is fairly sturdy and it doesn ’ t get degenerated .	506.52633682750945

If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come .	136.3636707857464

So , with the different pore size available and we always know that it is the polymers are not that distinct as this they are also having different size or different molecular weights .	114.35349894880434

Because , this is highly reactive , it will react both m and this , if it is less reactive , then the more reactive between this two will react with this .	62.17267628045252

That means enzyme concentration in the solid phase and not the E0 because as a result of conformational changes the enzyme concentration interms of activity can get altered .	67.94698532148088

When I talk of ternary complex formation I am referring to a ternary complex formation before the product is formed .	40.81046210059912

Termination can happen ; beta hydride termination to the transition metal .	277.493985300746

Now , there is always an associated equilibrium value of the monomer .	44.65009645976251

So for that is the example A I B N is typically used as around 60 to 80 degree centigrade , and benzyl peroxide typical reaction temperature is between 80 to 95 degree centigrade .	41.34257223936427

When we say higher or less than the Km value , when we compare substrate concentration with the Km value , what we are looking at in the case of zero order regime , we often look at the Km value ; K ' m is usually less than 0.01 S0 .	44.71566090770099

This is all .	46.95087025431681

You may reach closer to it as you increase the substrate concentration .	97.16704547868295

What we will do now with the polymer ?	21.001392686291748

Now , if you decrease the temperature both , the normal propagation and this inter - molecular circulation slow down , decreases .	181.77186868072607

Big one cannot go inside the pore so , will come out fast and the smaller one can go inside the pores , and which will take more time to come out ; obviously , polymers chains are also having a distribution .	123.75512566847743

Similarly , this temperature you have spinodal points like here and here , this temperature you have here and here similarly , hear you can join them and get a spinodal curve .	240.17687772837857

In the last lecture we had studied the mechanism , the strategies by which we can control the molecular weight of a step polymer .	16.69286874750738

As you know , these would have higher reactivity and higher reaction compared to these and this has exothermic reaction .	160.75020625583772

Now , if we note , we define conversion or if conversion is P , now , how do you define conversion P ?	167.126918722122

Due to thermo chemical reasons it might get inactivated but for some time it remains intact .	1255.8018478894799

Now , you can also argue , that as the reaction progresses , the monomer , the monomer concentration , in this case monomer means the species , which is forming the cyclic , that also comes down because you know , the time goes , the monomer molecule react .	87.01311990892543

Now , this at the interface react with phosgene forming this come out which again with reaction with this phenolate salt will form a dimer in this case and reaction will proceed further in this way .	124.02446698119157

In those days the alcoholic fermentation enzyme was called as zymase although that kind of nomenclature is no longer valid .	1293.8747095106726

You can actually deep that plastic material , in a liquid or similar refractive index .	167.98292946184853

Similarly there is increase in optimum temperature ; there is decrease in optimum temperature and there are cases where there are no changes also .	55.14526067257269

These two factors put together give you much higher catalytic efficiency as we noted in the case of one of the examples which I have illustrated to carry out the conversion of reactants into product .	57.564639757635064

The control of the enzyme reactors is rather difficult in the case of soluble enzyme batch processes or even immobilized enzyme batch processes and the control is much more effective in the case of a continuous flow reactor using immobilized enzyme .	49.358836581257165

These are the examples of big polymer industry where the the companies make the polymers in very large quantity , where the the applications where polymers find you know minor like examples I said where polymers are synthesized and added as a active or secondary ingredient in other formulations , those polymers are typically made by the smaller companies and they are taken , they are synthesized by the smaller companies .	327.5823023250017

Is that right ?	509.8552521425142

So , we need calibration and calibration is typically done .	58.99090380942007

Other than fructose , it will produce cyclose and galactose and all other sugars which are not desirable in the product .	291.7309062410366

So , we are writing R p as the rate of reaction , which is same as rate of propagation , whereas k p is the rate constant for propagation and E p is the activation energy for propagation .	24.4401105077095

So , R p would be k p , M , k d , oxidant by reductant concentration by , twice k t to the power half .	54.478370024290385

Until then from the residual mixture we were isolating L - amino acid and the balance was almost wasted .	1034.1352134910549

Whereas , a flexible polymer will have very you know much higher elongational break , in terms of impact properties again , a stiff polymeric back bone , if you apply impact apply impact then , with a short time , the polymer cannot rearrange and absorb that energy .	324.9966068154891

So , if you have a coil and if this is the center of gravity then all the segments .	25.509225612846553

In both the cases the cis product is dominating .	62.944240233575826

So , you can now understand that if I plot say percentage conversion with d p degree of polymerization or say molecular weight or molecular weight in case of step growth polymerization , it will only start from a slow… So , in a very low conversion you know the high the the polymer chains only will be achieved , you know high molecular polymer chains will be only achieved at very high conversion close to 98 percentage above .	78.1304863315701

That means , typically these hang around between this and if you do not remove your condensate or the polymer , if you wish , then your reaction will end up at oligomer stage , may be dimer , trimer or tetramer .	350.77987031666595

For example in this practical case of penicillin acylase catalyzed hydrolysis of penicillin the kinetic rate expression comes as k2.E0 v = 1 + K ' m / S ( 1 + A / Kia ) + P / Kip ( 1 + K ' m / S ) They have developed the reaction performance equations but the quantitative comparison of CSTR and PFR in such cases will become more and more complex .	200.05543484191014

We are now will talk about next type of additives , which are surface - active agents or surface - active additives now , this additives actual work on different interfaces .	192.77568404142983

You know they are used for very high in the application where you require very high temperature to sustain even kepler has a melting point which is higher than 500 centigrade , sometimes it even burn before it melt .	177.21356778585354

So , the path length between the scatterer and the detectors for this techniques is much longer .	138.34888938607165

So , proper choice of monomer is also very important .	120.94015690024376

Now , how do you determine seniority ?	67.53347519081255

You have to develop an analogy and understand the relationship of the corresponding terms .	93.67990816940328

Among the batch reactors there are mainly two types of configurations that are very commonly used ; one is the stirred tank where you use almost like a tank with the stirring facility .	277.79895983067456

So , in this case , both sides are amine group .	29.27882994015468

Depending upon the further application it may be deionized and other operations may be done , concentrated and you can collect the product and this was the system which was reported for glucoamylase immobilized on DEAE cellulose by ionic binding .	231.76381764206127

So , this is the mechanism by which , halogenated FR along with antimony trioxides synergy works .	211.03258300477333

In this case also there could be other reagents possible , which you , if you add or present are as impurities , it can retard or inhibit the chain polymerization , cationic chain polymerization .	142.15837558957887

These polymers after synthesized are added in some formulations along with the other components like in detergent , paint , ink , emulsions ; where polymers are added with some other compounds .	1031.5343867651948

Salting in and salting out both are feasible and of course the phenomena or the physical interactions are just opposite .	831.1133672828291

Besides that the carrier must also have certain properties like porosity that means large surface area so that heavy enzyme loading can be given to the immobilized preparation and we were talking about methods of immobilization .	137.82291810057058

The other desirable feature of the CSTR is that it can be used wherever pH control is required because it provides you an open configuration in which the pH monitoring and control both can be exercised which is very difficult in the case of a plug flow reactor .	53.766255400076595

Now if you look at the experimental value of a viscosity versus molecular weight of a polymer ; viscosity tilled entanglement molecular weight , viscosity increases steadily with a slope of one , but above entanglement molecular weight the polymer chains and the entanglement .	117.66439784385555

In this case all the monomers are same so we name these polymers ; we term these polymers as homo polymers .	108.70683955043101

In this case , these polymers cannot react with each other just by itself .	51.3969215774026

You measure the enzyme activity lets say for example for different particle size in a reactor and the effectiveness factor works out to be more than one .	76.26201006199528

Inhibition by product is a very general feature for all enzyme catalyzed reactions but some enzyme reactions are also inhibited by substrate and this effect because the concentration profile of substrate and product in the two cases of PFR and CSTR are different .	137.55396521357292

Particularly the enzyme which was mixed with the hydrophilic monomer is entrapped within the microcapsule .	151.71258162336753

So , from that value you can exchange , distinguish between , or find out what is the contribution from the surface scattering , and balls scattering on the Haze value .	127.4267455203269

How we can we have learned how to synthesize the polymers .	21.715699779134106

So , we have these three assumptions and which is reasonably fair if we deal with dilute polymer solution .	184.67850674754618

Now as I just mentioned that this light scattering technique can happen for any electromagnetic radiations like visible light or x - ray or neutrons .	188.66506943362378

So , M n would be given by M e multiplied by f where f is the number of end groups per chain .	25.208111810518606

Sometimes , the polymers are named from hypothetical monomers for example , I have this polymer are generally synthesized by hydrolysis of this vinyl , polyvinyl acetate .	157.29504780765146

The presence of even trace of oxygen inhibits polymerization reaction .	501.63054886041425

So if I want to summarize , just plane structure in short of substitutions .	206.1154502084596

Now , we just gave example of this alpha 6 amino caproic acids condensing to 6 amino caproic acid poly caproic acid in last page , this one .	190.79985369919913

In the case of activation energy and optimum temperature I mentioned that different systems have shown different kinds of behavior .	103.26208995304317

That means most of the substrates which is being fed gets converted into product .	57.06468055301911

So all these systems will be considered in the format of immobilized enzyme preparation and the enzyme preparation may be in the coupled form in the insoluble matrix , it could be entrapped into a semi permeable cell or entrapped in the gel because gel also provides you a porous network in which the enzyme can be entrapped and they will not be allowed to pass out through the gel pores because of the size limitation once they are entrapped and a similar thing applies to a ultra filtration reaction .	128.35260714149487

At the end of the cycle of the operation of an immobilized enzyme preparation , if the carrier can be regenerated it is desirable even if its cost is high .	54.62385056622063

And , how these are related ?	80.26556965028526

What did the commercial way of synthesis or the most practiced the synthetic process of making polyester or poly ethylene terephthalicin .	941.6012561130384

We will see in a minute how the surface area is actually important for this catalyst and also it actually help in increase the activity of the polymerization .	82.79292363750174

If there are significant differences in the reactivity of the two diols then there will be a blocky nature in the copolymers .	31.111005523196614

You get a diazonium derivative of the solid support by treating the support containing aromatic amino groups with sodium nitrite .	348.27155345677255

v ’ = 0 This gives you a generalized second order differential equation which can be set for internal pore diffusion cum biochemical reaction .	174.882925173495

This expression is valid .	42.91046621348387

Now , it can abstract this hydrogen and form these dead chain , and you have a new polymer , where you have a radical generated in between not the end .	92.04966771749754

Some cases , we take these natural polymers , and we modify this polymer synthetically for a particular reason , for specific applications .	196.49962806545042

One wants a sparkling clear beer and this clarification or what they call as the term chill proofing is done by immobilized papain , a proteinase enzyme which is immobilized and used in a column because it degrades polypeptides or even polyphenol oxidase also have been used or a mixture of the two so as to degrade those molecules and remove the haze which can be filtered and clarified beer is available .	652.404762805384

This is something analogous to micelle .	347.65094310762026

Otherwise , if you do not put a bracket it might gives you a confusion of you know which finally , which structure it is .	127.29601324243932

The reactor performance is under steady state which would mean that the rate of reaction and rate of diffusion are same .	56.03879693366863

Now this same polyamide having polyamide having same molecular structure , molecular formula , we can get it from ring - opening polymerization of caprolcatam .	294.4349971273698

The value of this T g is given by the two expressions I just wrote in it .	91.17011133700542

And large fraction actually is greater 95 percent of the fraction of the monomers will be present as large droplets .	105.69282941439843

And , there 2 path ways by which BPA poly carbonate , discriminate polycarbonate undergo photooxidation .	1998.2438723385574

So , we will find that the delays values are more or less independent or every monomer in this chain polymerization .	90.7609553079524

Now , let us imagine what happened inside this particle , you have a polymerization reaction going on at beginning you have a micelle at the beginning you had this micelles , with solon with this monomers one of this R dot or a oligomeric propagating radical gets into this thing , they start polymerization .	167.1350225779686

That means for any given reaction you need a specific enzyme and such specificity has both advantages as well as disadvantages .	166.61067604203367

So , basically , by using additives we can enhance or we can overcome the limited environmental stability of the polymers .	254.52896489638658

So therefore all the intermolecular forces that attribute to the enzyme conformation are altered .	161.684771001573

And there are some specialized techniques as well , where which are used for specific techniques , special polymerization techniques .	261.30504322393483

Now , we do not have to do ourselves ; now a days fortunately software ’ s are available which can take this and give us this output of this type of output they can give and from which using the formula which we used at the beginning .	147.5439852326013

If one catalyst works on a variety of reactions the life is simple as happens in the case of chemical catalyst .	54.15714155722778

So , as you seen that step polymers happens stepwise .	240.11157301847058

.Now Hazy is cost by both surface scattering , and balls scattering , and you can remove if you want to know what is the contribution from surface and balls scattering , in the Haze , then what can be done .	148.96910623839335

When we measure the effect of enzyme concentration with respect to initial reaction rate or reaction velocity the profile is linear at the small concentration range and then it tapers of in the large enzyme concentration range .	98.14316139216385

That means , this solvents are very poor solvents if you want to build higher molecular weight in the radical polymerization .	65.12182921068806

Where in case of radical polymerization X n varies each time the dead polymer chains are forming .	70.4630839101394

When the 10 percent monomer in the solution the reaction you are doing in a dilute condition the heat management is very good , viscosity is not high , so no gel effect happen .	37.751812395160655

And that is robbery here , leathery state and on further reading , it reaches the viscosity comes down and polymer chains can move fast each other quite easily and that state is robbery .	581.01298044568

The usual method is that an activated carrier is prepared by steeping it in a solution of transition metal salt for five to ten minutes and mind it that it is important because longer contact of the matrix in the transient salt solution can result in the degradation because the pH of this solution , like titanium tetra chloride , will be very , very low , almost one to two .	150.46401727120005

Again when I say the term high it refers in the comparative form and the comparison here is with covalent binding .	475.72170967293937

Here it is the low energy of activation as a result of catalyst and this indicates the high energy of activation in the absence of any catalyst .	52.27531137208446

So , product might will form much faster rate , if you are not starting the reaction .	159.21813303548944

If you do it at lower temperature , then M e value will come down and reaction will proceed till that equilibrium value of the monomer concentration .	21.42012024793362

So , you should not use that and wet membranes when they are used for the experiment they have to first the solvent has to change gradually so that they are wet .	170.11346695490437

So , a radical a kinetic chain or a propagating radical can undergo three reaction it can again reactive with the monomer and propagate , it can terminate , it can transfer .	135.25115309895992

Enzyme being a protein or rather a foreign protein to the body , the body is equipped with antibodies to generate immunological reactions and they can also be problematic and infact the administration of any enzyme for therapeutic application must overcome these problems .	1075.5626745387278

On the other side if you take let us say two different substrate concentrations required for two different levels of activity to reach for example say between 0.75 and 0.1 , that is substrate concentration for reaction velocity to reach 0.75 and 0.1 .	99.24221374268761

So , when polymer samples is injected in to this column then the solvent takes away or carries this polymer molecules to the detector and this pores which are in the column are responsible for the separation it brings about .	291.3387177334671

As a rule of thumb it is still valid today .	65.33928408963038

So , if you can find out theoretically , what will be the extent of reflection , then we can find out , what will be maximum transparency , of any material or a plastic material , and that is theoretically given by fractional equation .	88.72393541701489

Now , how do we get this , to get this we found the average life time we defined average life time of a radical at steady state at steady state tau s is the concentration of total radical species as steady state by the rate of termination square or 1 by 2 k t .	102.11654009336098

Now , that is achieved by reversible termination or reversible transfer reaction , say I have an initiator molecule which is R z .	125.63172998308156

And as is , as we discussed , that external catalyst is always preferred than an internal catalyst , that basically with internal catalyst , outside catalyst , it is very difficult , even more difficult to high molecular , so external catalyst is always preferred .	274.7581961648709

They bind in different ways .	75.04324550630135

Stable refers to that the enzyme , the amino acylase from aspergillus species was isolated and one of the first enzyme which was isolated was based on methionine acylase .	211.03348937685143

So , when you define degree of polymerization it is the number of structural units not the number of repeat units present in a polymer .	29.30482018466191

Also even as an analytical tool you can use when we want to determine many of the metabolite concentrations using enzymes , the basis of the design of experiment is kinetic parameters .	217.61679772145237

So , in case of cationic , r 1 is 10.5 and r 2 is 0.1 .	37.67999441065243

In fact the basic role is played by the unfavorable interactions present in the active site .	31.401227756079972

And we also introduced the term kinetic chain length how it is related to the average number number average degrees of polymerization .	19.106029391078504

This is z average molecular weight , but most commonly this two terms are used and those are sufficient for your description of your sample and to quantify the breadth of the distribution this term is used poly dispersive index or simply sometimes dispersive index which is given by this ratio .	176.32781554741354

Though they are very , they are brittle .	379.88888567026385

As expected in the case of soluble enzyme there is no recovery of enzymes and the cost of the enzyme in the case of immobilized process is very , very small almost negligible compared to this .	49.00999179342238

E * is energy of activation .	41.45894135584668

But if you think , to increase the temperature at some temperature the rate of depolymerization will also be insignificant , in those cases we have to consider the rate of depolymerization also .	59.56176309214482

In this case if you poly A , and a block poly B , then you can actually used these copolymer , block copolymer as a comfortabalizer , between poly A and poly B , and by doing this you can actually improve the property of the blend , of poly A and poly B .	49.48668337982124

Let us assume that the reaction follows the type of mechanism as indicated here k1 k2 k3 E + S ES ET E + P k - 1 k - 2 k - 3 It is a totally reversible reaction and you have the rate constant k1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 , k - 3 .	25.579374323975546

The substitution could be aldehyde group , or a say ketone , or a acid , or ester , or amine , amide , like this , so it could be any of this groups .	129.36700594135218

So , you can expect a linear relationship .	53.89873047220695

Thus , we have just seen from the freely rotating bond .	120.76079843512368

For example when we say general description I am talking of the reaction scheme that is the reaction which you are looking at catalyzing ; then the source of enzyme - which enzyme and from what source has been used ; carrier .	147.65177381570834

You get an activated matrix and the activated matrix then can react with the amino group of enzyme and give you the enzyme bound to it and the ammonia can be released .	41.13751054581729

So , we need to do calibration and then we need to do the normalization of the detector signals .	123.43650187608856

They are based on platinum cathode and a silver anode which is immersed in saturated KCl which is separated from the test solution by a PTFE membrane .	258.15998547605636

Now , one thing you might have noticed that for 100 percent bulk whether 80 or 60 percent it as reached a 100 percent conversion of the monomer where for the bulk polymerization 100 percent of the monomer as not reacted and make polymers , it as not polymerized 100 percent .	281.6937041361323

But in the case of a reaction that undergoes product inhibition the performance still becomes more superior .	146.05473766642913

So , we will , even without pushing the reaction to very high conversion we can make high molecular weight in this case .	67.9050929132516

So , if you write just polymer chain conformation like this and in and in real polymer , these are basically different chains are entangled with each other .	91.11996433440048

And if you are doing in a solution , you are doing this poly step polymerization reaction solution , then you can also try and change the solvent .	48.98779125561489

The most significant part is that they regulate the various functions of the cell in such an accurate manner probably no other control system in any chemical process plant can think of .	290.04126146062885

Now , what is the value of E R ?	9.633953460579669

So , it is , how can you write in simple term ?	136.94311323187074

At the very beginning itself , the polymers , large polymer chains are forming and as time goes , the conversion happens .	83.44279485351154

So , how can we achieve that ?	20.79987556859641

The what are the preferred conditions you know it should be external catalyzed it should be open driven system where you your systems should have ability to take out the small molecular byproduct as much as possible from the system .	148.59464382102593

So , from third to last will be z minus 1 because one is already blocked ; one of the neighbors is already blocked .	121.88979343276364

Ks One can develop the expression to write the differential and equate it to zero and that will end up in the substrate concentration for the maximum reaction velocity that is the maxima .	78.98999593213578

Styrene has been assigned so arbitrarily a value of Q is 1 and e is 1.0 and 0.8 .	231.07725738994304

So , if you start or anytime during your reaction , if your free monomer concentration is higher than the equilibrium monomer concentration corresponding to tact temperature , your reaction temperature , then what will happen ?	52.41339928750945

So , basically this is considered a perfectly reflecting material .	256.9635152758583

And if it is for absolutely clear application , then there should not be any haze or any yellowness in the material and so on .	155.95063987831

So , the cost for the particular application must be kept in someone , in mind of the , in mind of the manufactural .	221.36399921858123

Now , one thing also we should remember in case of step polymerization , that the chains , when the chains are forming during the reactions , the chains can , there is a possibility , that chains can also undergo exchange reaction between them and making the chains reacting with each other .	85.21169941452808

Their retention in the entrapped method is far superior compared to the soluble enzyme .	156.01059811414683

So , average number of initiator residues for polymer chain is given by , n n a by 2 plus ( 1 minus a ) n 2 by 2 by a , this is we term as b .	53.83957286586962

That means the molecular weight is more compared to the molecular weights which were getting generated before .	66.55768188294711

With small pull , they stretch out longer time .	2614.750450084277

You cannot use halogenated solvents , which were suitable for cationic polymerization because they are fissile reactions with the carbon ions and other polar solvents like alcohols or ketones , esters also cannot be used , as well as , H 2 O cannot be used because the same reason of cationic , because they can very quickly react with the carboionic propagating species and terminate the chain reaction .	273.1934535786108

So , with temperature a polymer material can show different types of visco elasticity behavior from a perfect elastic to a perfect viscous behavior , within behavior of visco elasticity .	110.51987189355619

And when they are added this nano - fillers are added to the polymer formulation , the resulting formulation or resulting polymers are called nanocomposites .	148.1702064344251

One of them oxidizes AH and produces A , where as the other one reduces B using the same co - factor in the reverse direction .	442.309428439457

Each initiator molecule produces , if we consider a thermally initiated polymerization , each I produce 2 R dot .	775.9230064454767

Or we can if it is not a homo polymer , it is a blend of different phase , there is a basically there could be two , one a soft or rubbery phase and a hard or elastic phase .	135.59404528391872

So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation .	145.4031899470557

If this instauration is at the end of the polyester , which you formed then these are known as alkyd polyesters , how do you do that , the same reaction like in this case phthalic an hydride glycerol there you are hiding one mono functional acids , which has a alkene group a double bond at the other end .	243.26862512727772

We must ensure that we are measuring our enzyme concentration in the linear range that means at low enzyme concentration level .	81.75764396966954

Until 2000 , more than ninety five percent of the Ziegler - Natta polymerization used combination of this sort of catalyst before the discovery of the metallization catalyst .	283.98501622566977

The yeast cells when they are permeabilized , the lipid on the membrane is dissolved by a solvent and it becomes freely permeable to various substrates .	755.0086407384051

When substrate concentration becomes very high the enzyme molecule might bind to two substrate molecules , one of the carboxylic groups from each of the succinic acids .	84.7531246879394

That is one of the major advantage but the major disadvantage or drawback from the industrial application point of view is that the specificity requires a single enzyme to be produced for each reaction , as the engineer will appreciate that the benefits of scale of operation for the enzyme production is lost .	136.53728260792826

There is lot of variation in terms of their characteristic features required as a specific catalyst .	94.64018441031133

And in today ’ s lecture , we are going to start our discussion on polymer properties and how they are evaluated , this properties are evaluated .	13.405464628317231

There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially .	407.2233273917883

So if you want show this in peterocially , if you are two face system immiscibly system you get corresponding , two T g corresponding to the homo polymers , and if you have completely mixed or miscible blend , miscible copolymers , then you have T g intermediate between these two .	309.2426819984276

In most methods we take either a prefabricated carrier or a carrier for conditioning either activation or some conditioning and couple that to the enzyme with a physico - chemical interaction .	668.6235469119969

In the lab the testing which is done is , call limiting oxygen index , it is most versatile small scale test .	514.6503950840372

So , how many molecules will be unreacted left over ?	112.3562584880544

Now in case instead of diol if you use hexanediamine and use that adipic acid , we will get poly hexamethylene adipamide .	386.2493341693293

So , you have to at the end of the polymerization you have to take out the poly carbonate by steam precipitation if you steam precipitation .	77.07219200216873

The energy required to reach the transition state is already reduced .	73.09038175340181

Most cases this M 1 and M 2 m will have difference in reactivity , and results what happened one of the monomers get incorporated in the growing copolymer , much faster rate compared to the other .	101.90308698165211

And then we said that if we plot this expression .	20.85349722074228

One example , there are many , many additives can be used ; one additives , one type of additives are shown here .	91.38108689745458

This loss of enzyme activity could be real or could be apparent .	127.85940308836179

For a photo chemical initiation or photo initiation , R i is twice fie I a ; I a is the intensity of the radiation , and fie is the quantum yield for initiation is similar to efficiency f for thermal initiation , this fie is the quantum yield for initiation .	242.06973419805183

In the first slide we saw that some of the enzymes which are of industrial value are very specific .	56.06589867614551

Average would remain same , 25 years .	2640.3683334284187

As a matter of fact that you need catalyst to accelerate the reaction , but you do not need in true sense , you do not need an external initiator like in the case of chain polymers .	30.901246752796407

And this D z is equal to this quantity where K is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature , f 0 is we can get from stokes equation , 6 pie eta 0 R h where R h is the hydrodynamic volume ; perform this we can get if we know eta 0 and the temperature , and value of this from this dynamic light scattering correlation .	268.0890433986027

So , what I am trying ; with this example , what I am trying to convince you that , may be the average remain same in two cases ; in the first case , there was 25 years 20 50 students , and in this case , you have replaced 4 student with 4 another set of person .	112.07576101532064

You can actually afford to have some degree of this impurities in cases of radical chain polymerization and that is why this radical chain polymerization are utilized in industry , the large set up , much more frequently than ionic chain polymerization .	104.54752921871761

So , what are the other observation we can make here , say at for a conversion of p ?	91.57029558564213

If you replace this one with if you interchange this molecule with this molecule , you are getting the same arrangement .	274.02504242990443

For example , for generic expression we are using , it can be , it can be shown here and the examples of isopropylene polymerization will be in water , you can write a termination reaction like this .	97.69477972779244

So , theta is T by psi .	493.3629865040638

So , you have to carry out reaction the temperature below above glass transition temperature and you the glass transition temperature come down with more and more monomer present in the system of the polymerization medium .	45.07775153616423

High specific activity means the catalytic power of the enzyme is much high .	211.60693118398564

The fluids have very strong conditions for example the fluid in the stomach will have a very low pH .	242.9702909085896

There are two R ’ s – R and R ’ are the alkyl residues .	208.76121898976064

It is increased by a factor 1 + I / Ki .	39.71305212632618

We are giving the definition of yield that means the total amount of activity , which is resulting in the immobilized preparation is reasonably high , almost in the range of say about 70 to 90 % enzyme activity is recovered in immobilized preparation and because the conditions are mild they don ’ t tend to cause conformational change so that is a very plus point as compared to other methods in which yields will be much lower .	133.24245595355254

Then , what happens is this equilibrium is shifted mainly towards this sight .	259.5749782958216

So , what is the equilibrium constant ?	10.552702286294041

In the case of allosteric enzymes we have a simplified rate equation which can express or which can describe the rate behavior of the allosteric enzymes .	56.4929538556747

Similarly here this imino carbonic acid complex instead of reacting with the enzyme molecule can react with hexamethylene diamine which provides you free amino groups and the hexamethylene diamine will attach here or instead of giving an immobilized enzyme , you will be getting - CHOH–CH - O - CONH - ( CH2 ) 6–NH2 .	196.39570921513237

These are mostly oligomers which can be polymerized using UV light .	70.24595391620292

It can act as a batch immobilized enzyme reactor where with the total recycle packed bag , the total recycle mode .	130.31220987966628

during continuous use .	1172.8890761805121

And if there a optical homogeneities just beneath the surface ; obviously , the amount of light scattered , reflected will be different , and the gloss will come down .	312.3939060925786

And as I said repeatedly in case of step polymers you get the high molecular weight only at high conversion where in case of chain polymers you can get high molecular weight even at low conversion , with time or with conversion only the number of high molecular weight chains or the amount of high molecular chain increases .	37.29305431473204

If you take or increase the polarity of the medium , if you compare these two the temperature is almost closed .	40.95434607363613

But there are some polar monomers , like methyl methaculate or methyl vinyl ketone , which can undergo side reaction , which actually restrict the molecular build up .	35.867615611939094

So if we require a definite property , or a property if you are looking for , for particular application then if that property is not available in a single homopolymer , then you can , from a prior knowledge of the properties of the homopolymers , you can actually synthesis copolymer of required proportion to get that property you want .	175.78292813816785

That means the free enzyme molecule will be inactive or has a very low activity .	68.29251829595309

How do you write them in terms of nomenclature , if you make say copolymer with styrene and acylonitrile .	131.35372887241377

They are retained in the reactor system .	12.291462304527942

Such a process therefore leads to a very efficient catalytic system .	140.5627196553196

The increase in the quantity of the enzyme required is not very large in the low fractional conversion levels whereas as soon as you cross 0.90 % conversion , the quantity required becomes significantly high .	98.65083769877882

We discussed the various types of chain transfer reactions possible in radical polymerization , and their effect ; effect on molecular weight in principle , that modes are chain , more chain transfer happen , molecular weight actually gets reduced compared to if there was no chain transfer reaction .	84.68738286351515

They are packed bed systems and achieving a perfect plug flow condition may not be feasible in large scale reactors while in the case of small scale reactors by manipulating or by increasing the length to diameter ratio one can achieve a much better plug flow behavior .	135.62882664298132

It could also interfere with the binding due to steric hindrances in such a way that the binding of substrate is prevented fully or partially and substrate and the inhibitor are mutually exclusive .	122.68778381326688

The same applies to agarose which is also a polysaccharide and also can be converted into a gel by cooling and there are some other polymers including synthetic polymers which have been used by this mode into immobilized preparation .	163.02604161214424

Let us talk about the effect of backbone stiffness ; backbone of the polymer chain .	25.521104883379415

So rate of mass transfer is klam .	52.126623079234015

? l / P This means Kappm increases by a magnitude of ?	184.80445456112685

So it is always given these and this choice , because the presence of this stabilizing group y as a substituent .	176.3077664963224

Similarly in the case of ES it will be k2.k - 2 .	26.27677399177531

So , the more the transfer reaction , obviously , the average degrees of polymerization comes down so as same , same discussion you can have what we had for the reaction , chain radical polymerization .	71.99369036419934

P is a probability that a propagating radical will continue to propagate that means continue to react with monomer .	61.559154866042164

Remember , the rate expression for redox reaction , it was k p M k d concentration of reductant twice k t to the power half and X n bar could give you k p to the power M k p m twice over b twice k t k d red ox to the power half .	106.97420964334611

I just taken out 2 student , added 2 , 10 years ; and , taken out another 2 student of 25 years , added 40 years .	1508.0777431135675

Homopolymer can have polymers made from two different monomers , say A and B as said in earlier classes , earlier class .	136.10385507515454

Substituting the value of ES from equilibrium analysis you can come down to a initial reaction rate vo = k2 [ E - S ] If you look at the original mechanistic hypothesis proposed by Michaelis and Menten , you can write k2 P + E .	76.87488829165375

When I say absolute specificity I mean that the enzyme can recognize only one substrate .	86.62533677452156

Secondly how enzyme under the same background is able to provide much larger reduction in activation energy and provide a more efficient catalyst compared to chemical catalyst .	82.71010575296462

So , how many number ; this is number of cells already occupied by the polymer segments .	44.228044023969694

This distinction between the two will be more clarified or clear when we proceed ahead but such a situation exists in the case of bi - substrate reactions .	231.28554902497373

But , this reactions we know this direct esterification of alcohol and acids or say ester an acid groups are very slow reactions .	449.1369047701806

This method is not very capable of measuring the number average molecular weight for very high molecular weight .	62.32466087671599

You can do it in a disperse dispersed resulting polymer the produced polymer could be dispersed in organic solvent and you can continue the polymerization as the polymers remain in disperse .	211.21605428386712

dx = ?	940.1781591901962

And it is the sample , and then you can detect the transmission transmitted light of the emitted light using detectors , and then you get the information about the sample from absorption spectra , emission spectra or a scattering like Raman scattering .	242.98419522842175

We also know how p is related to time .	115.50906266382547

So , that is the assumption we are making and we are telling that is mean - field approximation where we are considering that all the segments which are already present in the 3D lattice are distributed randomly ; they are not joined , they are distributed randomly .	63.15402121162251

But if they are very tightly bound , then they can coordinate .	75.14713367903

This plus… Basically , this , as I said , it can propagate from both the sides .	83.79640785173746

After the gel is formed then you can subject it to butyraldehyde to provide crosslinking and therefore get a permanently insoluble gel preparation .	275.94490525732846

Now what we will do in the next lecture ; we will discuss the strategy how we can and how those ionic polymerization can or would give the isotactic polymerization .	50.39090575897782

In all these cases by following a typical pattern that is by understanding the reaction mechanism , the binding of the inhibitor and substrate to the enzyme and their interaction between each other one can really arrive at a rate expression .	58.99781376218891

There are no similarities except that there will be some homologies of the sequence of different amino acids in same nature of functional enzymes .	176.75854870259636

So , if if only transfer possible to monomer , then you can write X n bar is plus C M .	86.17432002735391

Similarly in the case of most of the kinases , hexokinase , a typical example of the very first reaction in glycolysis , magnesium ions are absolutely required .	154.2964938571791

For in practice , most of the industrial polymers at the end of the polymers , if you measure the molecular weight distribution , you find , no it is found that PDI is slightly more than 2 , not much say , 2.2 , 2.5 , something like that .	70.16004588632802

It is reversible inhibition which forms the major portion of the effector molecules that are of industrial , medical or biological value in the case of understanding the scientific basis of enzymatic catalysis .	197.5865750565423

This is something like an extension to that and which means that when the substrate molecule binds on one of the binding sites of the enzyme it immediately triggers off a conformational change whereby the affinity for the next binding site becomes much higher and they expressed it with an interaction factor .	125.60648387940586

And then if we find further this values of Q 1 , Q and e for the other monomers by taking copolymers between them .	125.14010256249932

Km / S0 will be large and under that condition you must assume a first order kinetics and if the value of Km / S0 decreases the error will continue to increase .	53.744182993937166

There is no significant heat of reaction , isothermal operation .	131.38789375446305

There are ample literatures available from which one can write for pore diffusion control first order reactions , assuming spherical particles in the packed bed reactor the effectiveness factor is given as 1 / f = [ 1 / f ( 1 / tan3f - 1 / 3f ) ] That is the relationship between f and effectiveness factor and using this effectiveness factor then you can write down the reaction rate expression for first order kinetics .	145.1332587633718

Therefore when you are going to loose almost fifty percent amino acid , in recovery process the cost is going to be double plus the cost involved in the purification itself .	334.8116458710064

We have considered the reactions that follow Michaelis Menten kinetics , the reactions that follows substrate inhibition or product inhibition ; we also considered approximation with respect to zero order and first order reaction regimes in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	97.21164583273682

So in that case the other alternative is that it should be feasible that other interfering enzyme if there are any it should be possible to inactivate them by some pretreatment which does not influence the desired enzyme .	111.83646846580457

This is one arrangement and you can have same here , and now this is a arrangement which is alternating here , and this is two carbon have alternating stereochemistry , so this is a tryad , this is a t over tryad , and their arrangement is r r , racemic .	348.7809906669766

Input and output here are taken as zero because there is no continuous input and output .	328.6502272905132

At T 2 , you have again , this is the binodal points and these are two are the spinodal points .	54.00738828240498

So , if it is a polyester , you have to name as a polyester like polyethylene terephthalate , if it is a amide you have to name as a amide .	37.80226022971367

Total number of functional group reacted divided by total number of functional group present .	7.397895657232653

So finally , delta R s by C at C is equal to 0 will give you the K R s which is this K for the resistance by M n .	134.6802105636942

In such a case you will ultimately end up with the kinetic equation or kinetic expression which will express the sigmoidal reaction velocity profile response .	155.93473746425056

Even if you are producing an radical which is as good as death death chain , because it is not talking part in initiation of a mu chain .	202.03941500814324

This has been one of the attributes in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation where many times we require a particular operational pH for certain other conditions .	113.91060717751506

Now , this is the chain polymerization that is interesting because the polymers you are making .	37.55917890273663

In in a basically , very same manner how this equipments are done , light sources there is a light source , and there is a frequency selector , which basically select a single frequency or you can have the entire light in that particular region of interest pass through this .	491.16300897261215

This course as you know , deals with one of the largest group of biomolecules what we know as enzymes .	223.70861712253847

This concentration is in the bulk .	54.06253088449837

The effectiveness factor can be made to go towards one but in these cases you face other operational problems like at the low particle size there is a risk of high pressure drop across the bed resulting in more power consumption for operating the enzyme reactor .	223.35634982033196

In the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics if we put the v ’ term which is a non - linear expression the analytical solutions are difficult and usually you approach numerical solutions which have been also reported in literature .	93.75892155759767

If you remember or recollect from your memory in case of chain polymerization if you stop the reaction in between say after small amount of monomers got reacted , you will find that you have high molecular weight polymer as well as lots of monomers depending upon which stage you have stopped the reaction and also initiator molecules .	47.258357090477766

So , we get highly coiled chains .	134.68057139875427

These arrows represent this and this .	511.74954157678656

So , let us write this .	14.200581002765077

This is the volume of this particle .	36.473453148407444

Now , how a , if you have a monomer like this , C H 2 , again come back to that very simple monomer .	49.35137451303821

If you change the fractional conversion to , let us say , 0.99 , the Erel value shoots up to 25 .	89.98829302691492

For example , if you have say during a polyester formation , if you have something like this , there is one more very common side reaction is happens is by beta elimination reaction .	96.95378531054547

So , we can , for large x , we can remove or discard this term , ignore this term .	134.36576890844555

So far we have been limited in our mind regarding the application of enzymes that they can work only in aqueous environment .	92.59519799031719

Now , again if I plot , so that is the line corresponds to F 1 is f 1 which happens when r 1 is equals to r 2 is equal to 1 .	60.06927589138419

Similar applications will come here for biology also .	749.0486121237853

Nanowires or nanofibers , where it is basically whiskers or filaments with diameters in the range of 100 to 10 to 100 nanometer , having high aspect ratio .	1774.8690248497696

So , your polymer chain increases linearly and in this case it has , if it has to happen , it has to , the reactions which responsible for the chain termination of , by terminating the reactive in groups has to be absent in this case so that polymer can , polymer chain can increase linearly .	132.23611437636706

Similarly a number of ion selective electrodes which also function in the same principle of potentiometric transducer can be used as transducing element .	260.8508814586906

Most of the chemically catalyzed reaction or chemical reactions represent a particular order of reaction , zero order , first order or second order .	149.94637051551658

In those cases the binding of the substrate to the enzyme will depend upon the ionization state of the substrate .	12.02524421426172

Now , from our thermo dynamical knowledge we can simply write the delta G 0 p p is for pore penetration is given by RT l n this equilibrium constant and del G can be written as del H 0 p p enthalpy and T delta S 0 p p .	64.43703270635118

Within fraction of a minute they simplify the situation of a cardiac failure problem due to blood clot .	1059.8243491698927

Therefore both have the same relationship as far as the fractional conversion is concerned .	71.87235014766085

Rest of the enzyme concentration will not be useful .	53.035651250538166

So , the PDI goes beyond 2 .	159.64061272777536

Tensile strains for bulk bulk polymers are less than about 100 MPa whereas , metals and ions , they are quiet high .	2056.0027282927545

So , when you talk about you know , but in commonly , in common man whatever they see is applications of polymers , they see in daily life is a plastic , you know applications are visible as a plastics application .	437.59600183046734

In the case of F curve , the C0 is the maximum concentration and that concentration is reached instantaneously .	110.24891366689084

And as the reaction is very fast and complex , this kinetic data , kinetic data are often , often not reproducible because this kinetic data is not always reproducible , especially in this case of kinetics , especially in case of cationic polymerization , cationic , the mechanism and the mechanism on kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially cationic chain polymerization is still not completely understood , to understand the mechanism in kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially the cationic one , because as I said , these reactions are very fast and not reproducible .	151.94804683624386

They are used to determine r 1 and 2 .	74.57299800494535

They only say that after all these interactions have taken place some of the reaction mechanism responsible for catalytic function will take place and the reaction is catalyzed .	97.84798165640984

S / K ’ m + S The role of an activator works out to modify the intrinsic Km value of an enzyme and the effect on the Km value will influence the rate of the reaction .	39.99297071876628

So , hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case ; hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case .	58.099329685626834

I am just writing the Kappa values right on the arrow so that while writing the rate expression it will be easier .	133.7682803763196

So the typical range of bond energy , which are used for a initiator , to be applicable has a thermal initiator is , around 100 to 170 kilo joule per mol .	59.34611368717467

The method was proposed by King and Altmen way back in 1956 .	59.974432398800026

It ’ s only convenient .	291.54568374206616

At the end , if there are excess M 2 , you get free monomers .	144.962486998539

This is reaction monomer with the initiator molecule itself .	75.53636680459088

If you rearrange you get ( ds / dx ) out - ( ds / dx ) in 2 - .v ’ = 0 dx RD If you take limit dx tends to zero you can write simply as the second order differential equation d2s / dx2 – 2 / DR .	339.72205770400063

They are also used for thermal insulations .	232.41978623506682

And chain dimension the expansion factor will be more than 1 , so real chain end - to - end , RMS end - to - end distance will be higher than the RMS end - to - end distance for unperturbed chain .	23.08902483220644

Now , it was first started around mid - 1950s mid 1950s where first Ziegler , Scientist in Germany , he was doing ethylene polymerization ; So , ethylene and in pressure Trialkyl aluminum .	4281.84924189198

This delta T is the temperature difference from the final to initial .	217.8279954027831

If you consider a glucose isomerase it is a xylose isomerase .	163.06876027980655

So , with this we stop for this lecture , and we will start the next topic in next lecture .	7.173749603953134

And if the polymers are soft then they will stick to each other .	44.301414611523725

Now , if you want to do a reaction , and you should have prior knowledge about the initiator molecule , prior knowledge about their t half value , or the time it takes to become half .Then you can choose your reaction temperature , or if you want to do your reactions some particular temperature , or a range of temperature , then you can choose the proper initiator for your reaction .	62.8380900344879

So , ionic chain polymerization we will consider only when both the initiation and the propagation reaction is by ionic species .	74.6070526418539

So , an ideal solution formation leads to a thermal mixing with no change in enthalpy of the system .	139.71680178411827

It is coming from the expression we used in the last page .	35.29770252688046

How do you induce crystallinity in the material ?	15.897387799461361

So , polymer is one of the components among many .	171.30025161062392

We will discuss we will basically continue our discussion having polymers in solution and the topics , we plan to cover today this lecture is now cohesive energy density and solubility parameter .	84.814051955115

In this case , exactly is 98 percent , but for all purpose , we can consider P is 1 and PDI is close to 2 and MD is close to 20000 .	207.46792243899213

So , P e m 0 , so in case of that rearranging , we get P e as root k 1 plus root k or x n bar is 1 by 1 over P e .	260.9018070849722

There are arrangements for temperature , pH and flow rate control .	423.1739353840532

If suppose there is no reaction taking place then along the length of the reactor at Z the substrate concentration will reach to Sb same as in bulk .	71.28577162354226

And next lecture onwards I will start the chain polymers and chain polymerization with starting with radical chain polymerization .	40.160698839630996

So , let us stop for this lecture , and I will start the discussion of polymer additive in the next lecture .	15.888216469989976

So , what are the characterize , for the characteristic for the interfacial polymerization we just discussed one that polymerization occurs the interfacial of two liquids and each of the liquid phase contains one reactant .	432.67705035975683

The famous Jacob - Monod model , the Lac - Operon model was the one earliest study as far as the regulation of proteins are concerned and induction is a very common tool for regulation of the enzyme synthesis .	480.05114421282457

This can react with this self form non radical specious and this can form with other M n dot and can form a non radical specious .	85.58867184906711

So , as P is 1 , if you have some molecular weight in target , you can use this formula and you can complete the reaction in such a way , now r is the ratio of the functional group of the two bi - functional monomers .	39.19343057094996

So , we know value of R I we also can find out the value of I .	29.490542898904522

Number of ways you can arrange is 1 because no matter how many times you interchange the molecules you will always end up in same arrangement .	115.49730657963902

So , you are now convinced or you understand this understood this concept .	255.51727629530916

Otherwise it was difficult earlier because if the substrate is coming in the solution form in an organic solvent you need to remove the organic solvent put into water medium and then carry out the reaction which is practically not feasible but which can be made feasible if you use the advanced enzymes in the organic medium .	97.05290554506334

Collagen and gelatin are proteins whereas agarose is a polysaccharide .	1018.8303068638957

There are large variety of covalent bond formation methods available in literature .	48.642241610870364

Similarly , this line is the loci for locus for the spinodal points , spinodal points these are the different points for the different temperature .	173.3583435960896

Similarly , if the entropy denies term , can be reduced , then the T g goes up .	68.94666327352682

For adsorption we follow a number of methods .	229.99669352141942

Now , at higher temperature , if we increase T temperature , then this second term , T del S , becomes higher and higher .	143.36538730656568

They also have produced commercially and find several applications and some other monomers which are also used or polymerized by radical chain .	131.68591137949804

If you have no substitution , its work fine in radical , if you have monosubstituted , it works fine , except the case where it is C H 3 propylene , will come back of why it is so .	454.20272482196515

These are the standard kind of inhibition patterns which we are familiar with ; substrate inhibition or a product inhibition which is non competitive or competitive .	46.76282841395265

Turn over number may work out to be a lump parameter consisting of more than one rate constant .	92.77860112606231

The substrate concentration goes down and the reaction rate varies in the PFR along the length of the reactor .	33.10738674631313

In the last lecture we were discussing about the various ways of classifying polymers and at the end we came at the most important ways to , you know important way to classify polymer is based on its structure and the mechanism by which it is typically polymerized with , on the base of structure we , it was said that you can divide polymerization , polymers in addition and condensation in two ways .	85.62047506368445

Thatís why Iím saying first and third are similar but the enzyme transfers phosporyl group on to the third carbon atom .	128.18871694559434

Now , for all practical purposes , as I said that , this are equilibrium reaction ; this condensed are taken out from the reaction by applying high vacuum and high temperature .	30.1229111830754

However , if you remember , that the in case of temperature effect of photo chemical reaction , which is little more complicated because the initiators , which produces radical photo chemically , they also produce radical at a higher temperature .	171.72631683218847

For example , when a patient goes through a open heart surgery , the blood of the patient ’ s body is taken out and by help of external machine called oxygenator , which act basically as lungs and heart .	657.0910259727177

Sometime the information required is only to understand the optimum pH value of the reaction .	117.1205354550699

A student should know are expected to know the molecular distribution and polydispersity index in a step polymerization and we should also know that the for any high molecular step polymer the PDI should be close to 2 or as a matter of close to 2 .	115.90146232632245

For example take again the example of glucose isomerisation .	107.72951494456142

These two different situations will give you an idea , that in some cases and these are very important cases and have lot of physiological importance for the cell to have design such a enzyme which deviate from hyperbolic kinetics as we will see further .	184.65122592505483

Now , if you want to convert elution time to elution volume , there should be the pump , which are getting used in the GPC equipment should be pulse free and it should be able to maintain a steady flow typically around 1 ml per minute .	135.61673863007724

This chi is a temperature dependent dimensionless quantity , which is just defined like this to remove all the information from the lattice .	481.43143169310343

So , root if this is one is s , again the root mean square distance of the elements of the chain from the center of gravity or center of mass of the coil is called the radius of gyration .	48.295222392042

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and this eighteenth lecture , we will continue our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .	7.063690578247594

Now , when you add the monomers a very small fraction of monomer would be soluble in the aqueous medium , there will be small fraction of the monomer inside the micelle core as a soluble .	46.44084356255406

This is the important mechanism .	84.97842601708241

Now , this is known as Flory - Huggins equation as you might have known by now .	49.64098354008837

So , eventually , the concentration of M 1 in the reaction , M 1 monomer in the reaction will come down to 0 .	45.17885954020458

Because we were having the discussion on Mark - Houwink equation , let us start the method or the techniques which uses dilute solution viscometry .	117.42351301988488

Similarly the ks is the Michaelis Menton constant corresponding to substrate s and p corresponds to the product when you start the reaction .	374.47922921987083

Now , as we just said , that E P is less than E t , most cases , most general cases , so this is negative , which means , that X n 0 goes up with decrease in temperature .	70.49651809599786

Therefore it often gives problem in determining the various reaction parameters particularly the Vm and the km values .	316.2973703796078

I write VA .	1172.0906055376513

So , weight fraction is given by this number , this expression whereas , number of fraction was given by this was N 0 here how a plot will look like if a plot here .	160.41432987903084

So , they are thermodynamically miscible , immiscible polymers blends were the individual polymers components are phase separated .	1088.5727802744984

So , that you can make a high molecular weight and reaction get faster and you get the final formed final polymer in terms of a sheet .	51.704242787017414

So , how do you name this one ?	14.660338134729692

The enzyme is in structure confirmationally which is very much complimentary to the transition state of the substrates and by binding that it stabilizes those transition complex .	189.84507499116182

Now this three thousand , just to understand and bring it into a systematic feature , have been classified into six different classes .	257.73501151463546

That means energy content per molecule and the number of molecules in a system will have a Gaussian distribution and only those molecules that possess sufficient energy which are showed here by a shaded portion , only that fraction of molecules will undergo chemical transformation .	249.4888920063628

So , now I move to a a new topic nomenclature .	125.1207295438605

In this case , the same thing you can generate the z dot which is very stable like nitroxide triazolinyl trityl radical .	212.86728084053416

It could be a covalent bond , it could be some non - covalent interactions and those methods fall under carrier binding methods .	54.93083124235101

Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion .	84.81155585176575

The difference between the two parameters is k2 / k1and two parameters will become identical if we assume that the k2 is much , much less than k - 1 , if the k2 is assumed to be very , very small rate constant compared to k - 1 .	57.75758592565936

And also we need to very careful about that we have to run as many as can in the NMR as possible , this spectra more quantitative the lesser , the number of scam the error the more will be error in the in the composition .	263.6939248986096

And again it is a , as we can remember the discussion for radical polymerization , we can write if there is bimolecular reaction between a monomer and a carbanionic chain end .	88.58850544364275

And , they finally , they can form this , which is responsible for the yellowing of the polymer material .	100.11838151550057

If you look at the energy content of the molecules it will show you a Gaussian distribution .	47.31387991842463

So , typically this will act as an isotropic scatterer and signals which we can normalize with a particular signal which is placed at 90 degree for an aqua solvent .	188.77069123211163

So , what happen slowly this micelle core will become something like this is larger , so after some time you have this is say polymer particle , and this concern polymer particle and free monomer , and your surfactant micelle grows in size .	255.21451969608364

We measure it in terms of half life and the various reasons which cause the loss of stability during operation are enzyme denaturation , the thermal deactivation of the enzyme , adsorption of the inhibitory substances because the feed stream might include certain toxic substances which might inhibit the enzyme activity .	406.60818611126734

In the relationship Kd.t , t is the time of reactor operation .	196.74822616097413

So , this is done with a fix shape , this tensile test is done with a fix shape , size and environment to condition and elongation at at a chosen or specified rate d L by dt .	453.7769998758968

Now , what happen to k c and k p ?	14.100423885296

We are carrying out reaction in CSTR and when the reaction goes on , the product formed is sent out as the permeate in the ultra filtration cell and the enzyme and the polymer bound coenzyme is retained in the reactor and the substrate can be fed continuously by pressure gradient in the reactor vessel and the reactor can be continued over a long period of time .	57.716502893124236

So , what we will do in the next lecture we will start discussing about the other methods of determining molecular weight namely M n and M w and other polymer solvent interaction parameters .	16.022758720219976

That means the volume of the reactor occupied by the enzyme preparation is negligible compared to the total reactor volume whereas in the case of a packed bed a significant proportion of the reactor is occupied by the enzyme preparation .	20.239132654689985

Now , you know for organic chemistry knowledge , what is the stability of differing , what is the strain ?	107.06005384343602

So , unless there is a specific mechanism in normal case , there will always be syndiotactic would be a preferred tacticity .	101.5731863559752

And for large expansion it can also shown that , it is a approximately proportional to n to the power 1 over 10 , n is the number of bonds , so basically this expansion factor is approximately proportional to the molecular weight to the power 1 by 10 , where n is proportional to molecular , the molecular proportion to n , so for large expansion we will use this in future .	53.01364348802646

The solubility is enhanced by the formation of weak ionic interactions and the hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water and the protein molecule has a large number of charged amino acids which can contribute to the ionic interactions with the solvent and also formation of hydrogen bonds with the water molecule .	137.39396376363806

Therefore their concentration usually at the site is much smaller because of the diffusional barrier and therefore the km value is …. .. In most cases they are usually considered to be an increased km value which is not a desirable feature .	56.70843904981639

So , the reaction rate also comes down , and till the reaction is over , so that is stage III , stage III gets completed when this reactions gets completed .	228.64514095110718

Here we pass it through a heat exchanger just to maintain the temperature fifty degrees and pass through the immobilized enzyme column .	143.5018192647072

So , the slower the heating , you will see the decomposition temperature , at lower temperature , where as higher heating will take to higher temperature , basically polymer cannot follow , the heating , if you are doing the heating in much faster rate , the polymer cannot follow the heating profile .	274.1340725707848

So , rate of polymerization molecule is high and because you are not using any other chemical solvents or other things this gives you high purity polymers and gives you minimum contamination of the product .	201.81066187416673

One of the major contributions of Michaelis and Menten was that he confirmed Brown ’ s observation that enzyme substrate interaction undergoes formation of enzymes substrate complex .	255.58322153522536

And you know for large N , large value of N i Stirling ’ s approximation gives you ln N factorial ; this is from your previous mathematical knowledge .	384.42621955864666

In the characterization , I will talk on detail about the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and then polymer chain dimensions , and I also will cover in detail about various methods for measuring molecular weight of polymer , polymers .	99.06961871316155

That is the major constraint because the enzyme is located within the cell .	179.8786462647451

Because , 1 kinetic chain is getting broken down to 1 dead polymer and a another kinetic chain , which means , this is a chain breaking reaction .	90.11617297395384

These are the three major classes of continuous reactors but in practice a number of hybrids of these reactor systems have been proposed by people both in the case of CSTR as well in the case of plug flow reactors .	35.23272745061138

If you want to find out these , you have to know all these rate constant - k p 1 , k p 2 , k p n , k p 3 , k p 4 , and all this things ; that is practically impossible .	26.966487142009633

But the advantage is that the ultimate mixture of glucose and fructose is used as the product .	37.382691418367166

This clearly demonstrates the role of diffusional limitations on the effect of km and with the particle size increasing the system becomes more and more diffusion controlled for the particle is bigger .	204.96086006583917

This shift in equilibrium although not directly related in any way must be considered in conjunction with the rate of the reaction .	81.31999697088483

Even if the diffusional rate is very slow the substrate can reach to all parts of the enzyme go down to as low as possible and the ratio of the two that means the maximum reaction rate which you can get when you go down in the particle size to that of the reaction rate which is obtained by a particular particle size is defined as the effectiveness factor .	43.10250220382137

A 10 % error in calculation is usually taken for granted .	1428.184234198031

For example if we consider these polyesters , when R is c h 2 4 , c h 2 4 is linear alkane .	172.13077141525906

There is an oxidation of AH and reduction of B and this can be done by two enzymes .	158.495377985284

As I mentioned earlier , that this is your rate determining step , so the rate constant for this reaction is considered .	29.244587270655167

Or alternatively we take a water soluble polymer large molecular weight substance and mix the enzyme solution with this and the mixture is subjected to conditions by which the insolublisation takes place .	203.2211009341174

Now , in case for high polymers for high molecular weight polymers high molecular weight polymers again the probability is always the probability of propagation is higher because that is why it is propagating P also tends to 1 .	118.77567367482133

These this points where this two phase actually gets generates or the polymer become insoluble , they are called cloud points ; whereas for these composition , at critical temperature it will start forming two phase or polymer become insoluble , above this temperature , you can , you have any composition , they are insoluble .	302.9099528262616

And there are other possibilities using these where electron transfer reactions , examples given sodium and naphthalene , and as this , as if seen this propagation state , that termination is not present .	239.19613033440444

How to make a link between experimental data and the kinetic rate expression that was obtained by these two scientists separately ?	134.9877697897227

You need to make analysis of the enzyme reaction at the pH enzyme rate profile , detailed analysis to get the pK values of the amino acid residues involved and thereby make deduction .	142.3819871482523

A very crude definition could include it as a hybrid device where a biological recognition molecule or a cell or cell component is integrated with a physical or chemical detector .	600.8312103045273

So , it is same as if there was no expansion of the coil due to the presence of the solvent .	41.94485458008007

Now there could be three types of non - ideal solution ; one is a thermal where del H m is 0 , but del S m is not same as in case of what you have just seen for ideal solution .	58.79738052701715

The cost of production per unit quantity of the product comes down by over sixty nine point of total cost .	279.97405703871993

I should think about the lower values of p , 97 percent , or even 90 .	439.5209039988124

But this is , you should have , you know , you should have knowledge , that during the chain , during the polymerization the chains can undergo exchange reaction between them and they can be subtle , like if you have two different , if you are starting with , say for example , if you are not starting with two monomers A and type , your type , you are starting with different oligomers and carrying out the reaction from there .	76.31608905352603

It is generates when it propagate at the end is basically C H to Y C H to C H Y and so on .	288.4538767203825

And so the probability , that any conformation will have this two reactive function groups coming close to each other , so that they can react and form ring is always very low .	99.45264982008554

So , as more and more reaction is happening , more and more get , heat get generated , but fortunately the exothermicity or the amount of heat generated for in a step growth polymerization is not high .	102.77435388355813

The fractional conversion becomes constant with time .	58.89721462970852

They also can catalyze a number of stereospecific chemical transformations that are otherwise difficult to carry out in a single step by other chemical routes and also a major advantage of mild operating conditions which make them very attractive industrial catalyst .	277.2756919350374

For the first order kinetics this is the effectiveness factor as we discussed earlier .	26.216660332836845

Continue this here .	7325.34631696461

The boundary conditions in such a case will be x = l and S = Ss .	333.5565861279863

No , how the value of the R 1 and R 2 which is sincerely the monomer reactivity ratios , how they vary with the reaction parameters , and the monomer structure , what is the structure of monomer structure in the reactivity of the monomer reactivity ratios .	64.47407822325809

In the case of industrial operations , you always make a choice between two alternatives on the basis of the cost and effectiveness .	148.69356670658584

The third method is the reactor loading process .	56.70238358444906

You have k - 1 , k - 2 and also k2 , k3 .	27.542903799242865

If you talk about backbone stiffness , then they increase the modulus , and strength .	87.97696726557429

Theoretically the product in a plug flow reactor must come out exactly after the residence time of the feed stream but very often because of the deviation from the ideality of plug flow behavior it might come out almost in a slightly broad zone .	122.28051492866739

We also can form similar condensation polymers like polyamides .	367.64425309062926

The hydrolysis of ATP is a spontaneous reaction but in the absence of hexose it will hydrolyze only very slowly .	99.4767668454477

We have time , say it minutes , 200,400 , 600 , 800 and so on and this axis , we have percentage conversion .	235.7988682672304

So this is the molar ratio of monomer M 1 and M 2 , in the copolymer , any instance where the corresponding concentration of free monomer , in the reaction medium , given by this M 1 and this M 2 .	34.06163522334568

You can express them in either quantity , either as international units per gram of carrier loading or sometimes we can also refer them in terms of volume and thereby it can be compared directly to the soluble enzyme .	129.3041314187491

There will be a fall in the oxygen concentration , dissolved oxygen concentration which will be monitored by the electrode and this fall in dissolved oxygen concentration under steady state will be proportional to the substrate concentration .	81.3740814158756

It is k ln w p or S m by k ln w p will be given by minus N 1 ln .	60.013160861862005

Having understood the chemical and functional nature of enzymes , we will now move on to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	22.27750410882357

The fourth thing is that the ratio of Kí2 / Kím which you will recall from the basic definition of this parameter which is specificity constant or a pseudo first order rate constant for the enzyme catalyzed reaction Kí2 / Kím is small which refers to slow catalysis .	64.97546040926777

The fraction of conversion keeping the residence time constant and over operational time , this is operational time not the residence time , residence time is constant here it will go down .	161.77410182410446

So , basically if I want to compare , differentiate where you have a stabilized radical and a not stabilized monomer , stabilized radical plus a stabilized monomer , a not stabilized radical and not stabilized monomer , not stabilized radical and a stabilized monomer .	223.12199940034154

The third and probably , from the operational point of view , very important is stability because we must be able to use the same immobilized enzyme coating for a number of samples so that it is stable over a long period of time plus reproducible .	102.40770062068147

The first example that I want to illustrate with the use of immobilized enzyme is the production of L amino acids by immobilized amino acylase .	34.89801977421479

And non - bonding end to , and non - bonding pi star are very weak very weak absorption , which happens in this region 200 nanometer to 400 nanometer , which , so basically implies presence of nonbonding electron in the compound .	841.0080571946474

Consider the situation in the bulk .	64.72677786744404

So , it may have much lower hydrodynamic volume per coil .	236.70227882732954

So , when you take this polymer at this stage and mix with the other additives and fillers and do a compounding which is a further process which you do in a melt state , as I said in the first lecture , then these functional groups are free to react at there .	107.35387192940986

So , at any point of time there are two possibilities , either you can have 1 polymerization is progressing with 1 propagating radical , or it have a 0 polymer radical polymer , 0 radicals in this .	106.19005154262528

So , the polymers must be biocompatible and hemocompatible if it is contact with real blood , anti - thrombogenic because it should not start the coagulation process .	459.450619417493

When there is n number of binding sites the only difference is that the definition of Vm will change.Rest of the rate profile will remain identical and there will be no difference .	49.20098659241974

And then we range or rank those polymers species , depending upon how long they burn and how they burn , and whether they ignite that cotton , which is present below the sample .	526.5057861698349

Also many of the applications in beginning if you recall what I said that there are few applications or some applications where , though in not majority , a minor application of polymers where polymers are used in solution ; for example , eye drop where the water solvable suppose active polymers are used , detergents and there are several applications where you will find that polymers are added in solution .	202.83813062211988

They are also used in packaging material as like bottles , box - lids and they are also used in wire and cable insulations for electrical valve and they are also used in some of other uses of surgical and protective gloves .	822.5695985856336

v0 = vm S / km + S That means the magnitude of this exponential is negligible .	71.78730420334982

Energy of activation can be calculated from here which will be related to K * and also can be related to k2 and the two conclusions which we can make from make this analysis is that the fast reaction will have a higher value of K * , equilibrium constant for the conversion of reactants into the transition state or in other words the fast reactions will have higher concentration of AB * at equilibrium .	70.13337742008522

So , it will react with B , other side will be A , again this will react with B , so other side will be A .	15.432493406932876

The more is the polarity of these bonds , the more is the inter molecular forces between the polymer chains , which causes in effect more stiffness in the chains which makes the T g , which decreases the polymer mobility and which makes the T g higher .	111.84472801320277

If there is only AA plus BB tied molecule and obviously , f average 2 , when that can only happen when P is 1 .	325.40953331768355

So , in case of polyethylene , if you want to write polyethylene you know this is repeated and once you identify the constitutional repeat unit then you have to place this different parts of this repeat unit according to the seniority from left .	67.71225988049125

Conversion is related to the enzyme activity .	36.65712708016494

There might be two negatively charged , there might be one positively charged or there might be two acidic and one basic or more than that in the case of particular enzyme .	60.910090068096785

So , the reaction is very fast , so you can do it at low temperature in room temperature and it is usually done at a temperature between 0 to 50 degree centigrade .	24.481775048052207

Pressure drop will end the problem in the plug flow reactor because if you want to eliminate some of the problems associated with the internally bound diffusion in the system , the particle size has to be reduced and the reduction of particle size will mean increase in pressure drop across the bed and increase in pressure drop across the bed ultimately puts an economic barrier in terms of higher energy consumption for feeding the substrates and therefore in the case of very fine particles you can handle the system in a fluidized bed reactor without much pressure drop problems .	263.29413936644113

Just to illustrate my point with the simple example of a dimer having two identical binding sites , the reaction mechanism can be written as ks k2 E + S ES E + P + + S S ks ks k2 ks 2 k2 P + E SE + S SES ES + P ( or ) SE + P In all the four cases of equilibrium , dissociation constant is ks which are identical .	218.07155991331683

So , it is is not very economic in true sense and as you as you saw that we have to use wider lot of organic solvent and handling that large amount of organic solvent recycling them , and storing them and is a environmental hazard as well storing and handling them this organic solvent .	382.3291208113331

There are many other smaller applications but these applications require the idea of methods of immobilization and their application for reactor design keeping in view the variety of issues that we have discussed in the past .	137.02269801075798

The substrate will also ionize and depending upon the true ionization state of the substrate which is accepted by the enzyme at the binding site , the fraction of the substrate which will get bound will determine the pH effects .	67.30110178030633

If you want to compare the reactivity of these different monomers , M 1 , M 2 , M 3 towards a particular radical , essentially dictate by the stability of these 3 propagating radicals .	61.56753640362364

The most commonly used method of cross linking the enzyme molecules is by the use of glutaraldehyde which possesses two aldehyde groups separated by a hydrocarbon chain , the three –CH2 groups .	56.128464935601755

A very important general observation is on the basis of the average composition of the proteins .	72.43971728309353

Now , these R , R dot can be produced by the hemolytic cleavage of this C H type bonds , in presence of heat from the polymer itself .	167.581013186161

That means it is involved in the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to a given range of substrate .	176.56268237639947

Now , if they gets terminated by coupling reaction , the polymer which is formed here , that will have number of degrees of polymerization or total number of monomer present in that chain , will be twice nu .	56.026243942641244

Then in that case , you can live , build that high molecular weight leaving little excess amount of the condensate .	176.00771176579443

And the inherent termination reactions , as in the case of cationic polymerization by beta proton elimination , in that cationic polymerization case are not present here because beta hydride elimination is difficult .	84.41378665913763

That means the quantity of the enzyme required will be identical in both cases for carrying out the same conversion and at the same enzyme loading .	23.047398998811037

Then you should know the strategies if you want to have some functional group at the end of the polymers both side , then you should use the monomers containing that functional groups in higher amount and the ratio should be according to your target .	83.17495165387861

When this stable free radical polymerization is done through nitroxide , it is often called NM p nitroxide mediated polymerization .	647.6662656115124

Any analytical device in the form of an electrode , physical device which can be usually calibrated in terms of the concentration of the sample it is much easy to handle .	161.22927546574593

They make this process definitely , they make or they synthesize the polymer in the , polycarbonate in the plant them self .	392.258336114964

This was originally proposed by Natta himself .	125.56067645864505

So , you must have , this you keep in mind , when you design additives for step growth polymers .	42.16702174435962

So with this , we conclude the discussion on determination of molecular weight by viscosity method .	19.405109649122657

So , for a open driven system with incomplete removal of the condensate k , again CO concentration H 2 O COH .	601.6924949600292

So , the initiation reaction actually depend on the first step , not atall on the second step .	141.2768563545792

Now , because the reaction is happening in the interface and at interface one one reactant is reacting with one of the other reactant .	131.91124068505357

And if your monomers , if your side reactions , which hinder the reactivity of a functional group , if you have some species , which is generating , which is affecting the reacting functional group , that also will hinder your , you know , reactivity of the functional group , hence the polymer formation .	113.57137832675974

Both the products find application in the food or related industry .	291.6139473111715

So , drop the percentage , drop in M n because of presence of non - polymeric small molecules , the effect of M n will be more than M w So , M n will be dropping more compared to M w .	103.4178414716094

For example , with highly elastic polymers like rubbers , they have low modulus 7 mainly about 7 MPa , stiff polymers which have higher modulus about 4 GPa and metals is is much higher , if you compare a polymer and metal , metal is much more higher modulus .	677.6110567226763

In other words if you write down the reaction mechanism EA this is k1 , k - 1 and then this will go to EAB and this is k2 and k - 2 .	34.16200090423916

If they have alternate stereochemistry next to next monomers or next to repeating units , then as call syndiotactic , and if the stereochemistry of the repeating units is randomly placed , there is no order and then , they are named as atactic .	196.75393373907568

In addition to that , the understanding of the enzyme inhibitors or activators gives us very precise information on the specificity .	57.867289753024785

So , name has , will be polyoxyethylene instead of polyethylene oxide .	325.4883627917311

And if we write F 1 , is the molar ratio , or mole fraction .	36.08768953876178

Remember we just discussed in last lecture which just means this is not exactly , but this is approximately proportional .	99.32198532965509

The advantage of metallocene polymerization is that , as I said that this can happen in a homogeneous condition and at the end of the polymerization it can isolate the monomer , isolate the catalyst and purify and then we reuse the catalyst one more time .	82.00202977121059

So , if you replace one of the molecules , say , solute molecules or solvent molecules with another one , there should not be any change in the energy of the systems .	45.568882244707694

As you have seen that with decrease in temperature we get preferentially syndiotactic formation ; if we increase the temperature we get atactic formation .	75.3157636637531

That means they can act up on two or three different amino acids but most of them are very specific to a particular amino acid and they are produced and the DL - acyl amino acid can be hydrolyzed by the suitable enzyme which hydrolyzes or … .	120.85519326600024

As a catalyzed reaction , we are interested in the EAB * , which is the transition state complex which will give you a product at much faster rate .	42.069108834181

If one of the orientation is preferred , much preferred , if one of the orientation of this incoming monomer molecules is much preferred over the others , then what happened ?	228.01683397997317

So , that is for the first solution theta c 1 .	121.75647842863069

So if there is a exothermic processes , delta T will be higher as a result of increase in heat , inside the sample .	61.314267897781626

This is one way to account for the non - ideal flow .	32.62787612810191

And , another very important point polymers which is made industrially by this technique is as we discussed several times is the polypropylene .	214.56964613651297

in Japan .	2391.0751419682247

You can call it NAD activated .	253.21604991249836

In all the situations the performance of the reactor is lowered compared to what we look for by analysis in the case of an ideal fluid flow pattern .	85.1924066266042

There is a insertion of this new monomer ; this new monomer in the alkyl carbon linkage alkyl aluminum linkage and forming again the original titanium… which will now add to the next incoming monomer .	342.11826561810125

If you are using adsorb preparation there will be a continuous reversible desorption process and leakage might be there .	302.80284969301823

So , light scattering from a polymer solution will depend biased ; it will be heavily dependent on the larger molecules , not the smaller molecules ; which means , the property like lights catering depend more on a M w , not M n .	304.7916081167979

Now when you mix this two , as it was mixed by Ziegler what happens , this forms beta form of titanium chloride which is brown in color .	230.55660850063367

So , you get more and more polymer with average molecular weight remain same .	37.53684850074361

When you take lower substrate concentration , 0.2M the activity loss is much , much higher and over the same period of time instead of 50 % it reaches to about 25 % and this is the case where if you recall we discussed the substrate dependent enzyme decay .	97.29292571639606

Now , how to get these delta value , the value of the solubility parameter ?	35.96020480856718

That is a definition of immobilized enzymes .	41.28866604927946

H * / RT ) The final conclusion is that for a catalyst or an enzyme in our case as we are talking about to be able to include the value of k2 , it must be able to reduce the energy of activation or increases the K * value that is equilibrium constant .	49.68916596748084

The F 1 versus no monomer the ratio of polymer composition is versus monomer composition curve is similar to ideal copolymerization , but skewed , but skewed towards the composition of the copolymer richer in the repeat unit resulting from the more reactive monomer .	308.3565399237163

If in this case , the centers or this have similar geometries , all these monomers are linked with same geometries are stereo stereochemistry , then we call this as isotactic .	416.75255747688254

The independent subunits or the independent binding site implies that binding to one site does not bring in any conformational change so as to change affinity of other binding sites .	285.9986517996912

So , the output signal in this detector is proportional to the concentration and if we assume that detector response is proportional to the concentration in the range we are working , and also this response does not depend on molecular weight .	81.5263603380283

Then the fourth property which is a very important basis for choosing the immobilization method is carrier cost and regenerability because each method has a limitation of the choice of carrier .	122.90568170792434

So , in this case lets draw for simplistic spherical micelles , so you have surfactants mainly as micelles , but also you have free surfactant in the water medium ; the concentration of this surfactants are CMC .	551.1323102505976

That means you take the monomers as such which ensures the maximum possible concentration of the monomeric unit .	62.6491478256986

So , with this we come to the end of discussion on gel permeation chromatography .	10.230114417024414

Both reactions involve addition of water and ammonia respectively on to a carbon , carbon double bond and give you the corresponding products malic acid and aspartic acid .	246.89244014165206

Given everything is other is same , transmission rate will go up for a smaller size gas , compare to a higher size gas .	869.6162032887371

Now pi is very small .	169.43265654376512

Now , when you use a plastic material like polycarbonate compared to a glass this becomes much lighter , you know its gives you lot of comfort than the glass .	234.94625793760838

Now , that aggregation could be , could be affected by temperature and it is actually lower temperature .	105.3107119541759

Now , this is between c and d you can clearly see that c and d are the binodal points… where is 0 between c c and e d and f the slope is changing in positive way so d pie 2 is greater than 0 .	165.24967327960152

Either inhibitor has to bind to the enzyme or the substrate has to bind to the enzyme .	31.68007273664229

So , f is the number of functional group present in this molecule .	16.559385894656387

Ded2S / dx2 – v ’ = 0 v ’ is the apparent rate of reaction that means under apparent kinetic parameters in the case of immobilized enzyme and De is the effective diffusivity .	70.15475129861491

Then only you can compare .	137.42572370178502

And then it forms a cyclic transition state .	30.992480045467023

Now , entropy , sorry , enthalpy of mixing .	407.56589525027147

It will flow the solvent molecules will flow past each other ; it happens even for flexible chain if the coil size is little low , and that is dominant for this short chains .	245.54716598566094

So , if you , you can imagine as well , that as you grow longer and longer the number of conformations , which will enable the two functional groups at the present at the end to come closer and react and form ring will be lower and lower .	67.7348024933425

For example if you are going to immobilize this enzyme you can introduce a kind of a hydrocarbon chain before it is really coupled to the enzyme molecule .	46.491943432229334

Now , this , these are the examples where you do not have an inherent termination reaction .	18.723597019741558

Another way of this polymers ; the Zeigler - Natta polymers get terminated which chain transferred to the group one to three metal alkyl metal like aluminum alkyl , we just discussed .	96.20637217782242

The second effect of temperature in the case of a enzyme catalyzed reaction is the dependence of K2 that is the turn over number or the rate constant of the irreversible step of the conversion of ES into P and that classically follows a Arrhenius kind of a pattern that is K2 = A e - E * / RT We have seen this analysis even in our initial lectures on catalysis that means the catalytic pattern of the enzyme as the catalyst and one can again analyze in the same manner lnK2 = ln A – E * / RT Very familiar profile 1 / T versus ln K2 , you get a negative profile and this is a slope of E * / R and that gives you a magnitude of energy of activation for the given enzyme catalyzed reaction .	138.8031034870006

So , I can put another constant k 1 and eta square because there is no constant term because this passes through the origin .	88.67504367742917

Lysine has been most commonly used for covalent binding , next followed by cystein followed by tyrosine , histidine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid , tryptophane , serine , threonine and methionine as the rare case .	1311.8792767578302

So , this is the only one distinguishable way you can arrange a pure solvent or a pure solute .	63.82470599125917

If you look at the industrial applications until sixties there was not a very significant application of enzymes in industrial processing .	81.70589821617438

And we found that in general , flexible backbone , if you have a flexible polymer chain backbone Obviously , if I want to write here , if you have a flexible polymer chain backbone , then it is easier for somebody to apply stress and deform .	101.17199757823504

Let me once delta H m by delta S m .	116.92758077486948

If you notice the shift up to what I have already told you see pH effect change .	246.46561991969347

Yes only inherent kinetic constant and Ö.. ... When we assume that ?	636.8787449885509

The concentration of E - is negligible .	38.7228021237425

So , monomers with polar groups in the substituent will help in coordinating with the counter ion and the monomer ; the incoming monomer .	77.93976995261067

Now , it can be easily shown to have this expression ; let me show that .	81.05866827736168

So this can , this counter ion help in strong coordination between the active chain end and the polar substituent of the another monomer residues present in the chain .	70.86023799446157

In today ’ s lecture we planned to cover interfacial polymerization , and we also will be talking about different synthesis of different step polymers in very brief briefly .	85.11030438336107

Now , between styrene radical the propagating radical from astyrene polymerization , vinyl acetate polymerization this is much more reactive compared to a styrene radical generated from styrene molecule .	66.26832443796435

As a polymer chemist , you probably what have to do , the processing part or the characterisation part but then you must know the techniques by which , the processing is done or the techniques or the different properties , and importantly the structure properties relationship between the property and the chemical structure .	173.44773825002102

Till now what we have been learning for last several lectures is how to synthesize different polymers , how to make different polymers , we have learnt different types of polymerization by which we can make polymers .	105.5771730272798

How polymers are you know named and also I will talk about give you a prospective of the molecular weight of polymers .	78.15155056050216

Otherwise it cannot be used as a drug .	52.836755670934856

And in this lecture , we will continue our discussion on polymer solutions , the remaining part , and then start a new topic on chain dimensions , polymer chain dimensions .	33.757626584304695

Here you have the active site , the sites on which the binding groups available on the substrate binds and this portion shows the substrate which is analogous to the key .	85.14472151989953

We will continue in this lecture our discussion which we are having the last lecture on polymers in solution .	27.273109116009838

But the technical details of methodology for immobilization remain the same as in the case of enzymes .	110.55638852984839

The measurement of activation energy is also used as a kind of a experimental data to check whether the system is diffusion limited or not .	80.36853495589514

So both the things have to be really tackled so as to be able to apply enzymes on a large perspective like for example glucose oxidase can use large number of electron acceptor other than oxygen which can be then reduced at the expense of glucose .	160.8375525425944

And any region any point here would be meta stable one so in single curve , single diagram you can get complete phase diagram , it basically gives you the phase diagram of that polymer in that solvent .	249.70423918479497

Now , how the molecular weight or degrees of average number average degrees of polymerization related to nu , it is twice nu , if the chains or the propagating radical terminates by coupling and it goes to nu , if the termination happen by disproportionation .	93.12439597492204

And we have found that to be true as well what we did not , which we did not consider is that giving polymer reaction , we know that is a H O thermic reaction .	93.70699731331008

These are the two molecular strategies which are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme .	24.21209629320064

Again there are companies sell these polymers in different trade names and this is not expressively .	362.3889226349486

So , if you do not mention T i nor if you just write T then ; that means , it is the initial temperature of the thermostated chamber .	150.01660703741712

So , I will , ethylene dyol ED , which gives you polyethylene teritarate , plus water .	458.2324565865989

So , in real case , incase of real polymer chain there are long range interactions , these are long range interactions which cause the chain dimension to be generally higher than the unperturbed dimension .	91.8936135868374

In practice while we get a preparation which is highly stable , we also get a significant loss of enzyme activity .	77.538704470999

So , the collision frequency between the 2 molecules , 2 oligomer in this case , we will ; understand ; I am talking about the collision frequency between the two molecules .	24.495384540421107

They are very difficult to predict or estimate the reactivity ratios and as a result copolymer composition from given monomer structures .	103.33723028391518

Tryads , where we are talking about the three… center adjacent to each other ; like in this case , you have a meso pair and another meso pair .	57.38596502229832

The other one is non draining polymer molecule , which is the case for most of the polymer molecules , now in a linear flexible , any flexible polymer chains are closer to non - draining polymer molecule .	43.34852143858233

They will be from different groups as we mentioned from electron donating groups and withdrawing groups and one from electron donating groups .	274.9475206685858

Other examples also like peresters , let us talk about in next page .	107.76907119001261

For unknown sample , then how do you determine the viscosity average molecular weight ?	29.163401811113516

Now vinyl acetate , obviously undergo very fissile homopolymerization , but when you have a styrene as a second monomer .	238.77968953758764

You take a very fine small column and insulate it .	153.30335761391385

So basically in this case , energy supplied is plotted against temperature .	68.23406935714611

So , this keeps the entire distribution ; this is the normalized intensity and if you look at the gaps between the molecular ions you can see the gaps is 100 Dalton which is exactly the mass for a MMA repeating unit .	235.67720007519748

So , these are the examples of some of the solvents , which have , medium , low to medium polarity and does not high react with those ionic species .	95.15908284207276

Whereas M 1 star can react with M 1 star in some extent , so what will happen , you will get a something like this .	44.19712447890391

So , with with a use of this nanoclay , the base polymer it has improvement in modulus , tensile strength barrier and fire retardant property .	502.10011009993104

So , if you take a monomer , a polymerization mixture , the end of the things maximum number will be present at the monomers , then dinomers , then trinomers and so on .	124.02634882562477

Now , that happens if your polymer glass transition is is way above your room temperature .	139.7112113093079

The example of the glucose isomerase is a typical example which has used such a phenomenon .	111.71246278219795

Today we shall discuss about some of the issues and the future directions of enzyme technology that we are likely to face in near future .	301.489442817955

And , if the rate becomes limited , you know , when they becomes equal , whenever the chain grows , the significant number in this case , say 3 .	218.8664102475987

The decay in the reactor performance will be more pronounced in the case of substrate independent thermal deactivation compared to CSTR .	21.369574348800306

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistr y .	44.958322560889094

There will be hardly any situation where a substrate concentration can change twenty seven fold or such a high level of change .	155.37526732697998

Now , if you have this of most of covers , all the conditions , all the criteria if you have need to follow a successful completion of a step polymer .	175.63330060985473

You can multiply it both side by and convert it to ; N 1 is the number of molecules solvent molecules and small n 1 lower case n is your number of moles solvent , number of moles of solvent .	169.3621178213847

Entrapment methods are also a very large class of enzyme immobilization methods that are based on the occlusion of an enzyme within a constraining structure .	289.3923714715714

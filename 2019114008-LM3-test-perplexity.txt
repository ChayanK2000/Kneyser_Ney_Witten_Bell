That is for a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction how to identify the reaction mechanism it follows ?	40.593247404564096

Reacted is P and P is the conversion .	244.95443865303562

For visible light radiation , it depends on the polarizibilty of the medium polarization of the molecules or the particles which is scattering light or the one which the light is bombarded .	218.0522702751334

Now , how do you know ?	12.10160700309301

For example this is the material column and you feed the sample through a pump and you have a small heat exchanger which maintains in a very controlled range the inlet temperature and the outlet temperature is monitored by a thermister which is installed at the outlet end and this is connected to measurement circuit and measures the impedance .	466.06860634684926

The same expression , which I just showed in the last page , we can simply do mathematical rearrangement and get an expression something like this .	44.9879635484884

That means we simulate the value of v .	143.30788999594347

Third point we also develop S3 v3 .	187.83896228634288

Now , you know as a matter of fact that this does not exist as such independently because it exclusively exists at its tautomer of acetyl diode , but because this polymer looks like that it has been synthesized from a hypothetical monomer like this , this is this polymer is generally named as polyvinyl alcohol .	129.83076520331406

And it could be the polymerization could be done in an emulsion , now we will talk in more detail about this emulsion polymerization now .	53.94066558302475

So , remember , we talked about in step polymerization that the reactivity of the functional group present at the end of the oligomeric chain or a polymeric chain , does not depends on what is present in the other side , whether the other group is reacted , or what is the length the oligomer .	32.14910952894727

Similarly , as in case of ATIP reaction or reaction , where I 0 can be replaced by the raft reagent concentration and the beginning and again try other cases , we can utilize this raft reaction reversible addition , fragmentation transfer reaction for making block polymer at the end of the polymerization if we add a second monomer .	52.07488270166411

So , you have binodal points here and you have spinodal points here , like that you plot T 3 , and T 4 , and T 5 , and T 6 and so on .	103.10381378145222

So , polycarbonate will obviously become soluble in chloroform , it is 19.5 and 19.19 , 19.5 .	1380.5485582380938

Assume like in the first case that the enzyme possesses only one ionisable amino acid residues .	51.15363879308613

To illustrate schematically the same concept of a biosensor I have taken here a substrate molecule to be analyzed in any given system .	121.08491334013996

If it is this M n dot , which is the original propagations radical is more stabile , then obviously , this will be more preferred reaction over transfer reaction .	119.54022945741345

As I know as we know that high monomer gives high reaction rate .	114.90558424209476

So , if you plot the conversion , we plot the conversion with time as more and more active micelle form or the polymerization takes place in more and micelle more and more my micelles .	100.83924422947655

And the commonly these are called I will show you the example in the next slide , if you have CO these are called polyketones and specifically this structure is called poly ether ether ketones and simple this called polyether ketone , you have if you have a sulfonegroup SO 2 group in here then these are polysulfones .	332.28530554005084

For example , if I consider a case of halogen acids like HX and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond .	146.42247226248614

So , again , one more time let me emphasize , that if you , every temperature , every , your reaction , you can choose any temperature of your reaction and consider that as a ceiling temperature .	84.03230491215861

Another group of mechanisms that we will discuss are enthalpic factors .	85.57165036483558

So , K s c is basically the equilibrium constant between the concentrations or because of the partition of polymer molecules inside the pores and outside the pores .	51.97843459852929

In those cases another factor which we make use often for analyzing the reaction mechanism is the enzyme inhibition data .	142.6937245007621

Similarly , if you take a semi - crystalline polymer and heat it after the T g , the change in the polymer behavior is less compared to a pure amorphous , because they are part of the polymer material is amorphous ; part is crystalline .	69.082582982535

While alanine racemase can act on either side of the reaction , it is a reversible reaction and therefore it can act on both L - alanine as well D - alanine .	148.86129063846852

Now , again in case of radical polymerization , it is little complicated because the molecular weight forms during defined times of polymers are different .	94.34163035009047

The characteristics of the bed can be theoretically numerically accounted by voidage what we call as a factor called epsilon which is the wide volume in the bed divided by the total packed bed .	240.27501778022148

And if we have groups like , acrylic acids , methacrylic acids or styrenic , which have a strong absorption , then this this this type of polymers actually help us in detecting the trace amount of residual monomers ; if the monomers are present , then it will give us from UV signal , UV - visible absorption signal for that monomers .	249.30176174653062

And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , I can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization .	33.44918875437195

Because each enzyme has specificity towards one of the isomers , substrates can be resolved into respective isomers .	765.8663337904742

So we just , one more time let us discuss .	49.221295378798246

The third item we have seen is the inhibition pattern which the kinetic reaction follows and probably another pattern which is very , very important in analyzing the immobilized enzyme reactors is the reactor type and operational stability .	108.84664430784348

Another important significance of the Michaelis Menten kinetics is its application to assay of the enzymes .	67.43141631657834

In this case we just talked about the propagation and initiation , propagation and the termination reactions , now there could be transfer reaction , chain transfer reactions as well .	29.386658598025384

In dilute polymer solution , we can assume the following reasonably well .	119.28573196296773

So , I can name M ; and also , we are drawing , write the summation of M i dot .	135.92547505853526

So , conversion is number of molecules reacted , number of function group reacted and the number of functional group originally present , so that is a fraction , that is a conversion , which gives you 2 by f average minus twice N by N 0 f average or twice f average minus twice X n f average because N 0 by N is your X n .	106.10775170851294

If you carry out the steady state reactor performance as a function of flow rate and determine the overall reaction rate constant based on the reactor performance , then you can determine by intercept 1 / ?	30.896914763930212

But the L L dash can be same or different ; from different metallocenes like Cyclopentadienyl or Indenyl or Fluorenyl .	528.7958274527003

So , if they can react inter molecularly and make a cyclic product , so if you talk about amino acid , it can form a cyclic product plus H 2 O .	84.06104816467892

l is less than one .	8.297963254969082

So , basically increasing reactivity ratios may not be different .	108.8759120003217

So , this is what is observed experimentally in this axis .	123.86052337094071

Now this can break into two species , let us write in the next page .	23.835611698362783

Now , will talk about copolymer form position , now in most cases what happened , because we are mixing M 1 and M 2 , and you are copolymerizing form there .	240.73265801405063

Light stabilizers are added as additive to eliminate or reduce the reactions in the polymers caused by visible or UV light radiation .	838.2850871903895

Now if I consider phi , as the intensity of the , or flask of the incoming light , and .	28.806283055835173

So , if you talk about length then , it will be change in length by total length typically , we express strain in terms of percentage .	174.41805143370806

Now , if that has to spontaneously phase separate in to in to two other composition obviously one has to be polymer rich and this one and other has to be solvent rich left hand side .	83.79299595125231

We , the effect of pressure is not that significant for addition polymerization .	91.77052199651871

So , this stability would be similar to stability of this radical .	78.29431922255137

I will stop here .	21.81512246984651

They are the ones which very heavily dictate the choice of the reactor ; whether to go for a plug flow reactor or to go for a batch reactor or to go for a continuous stirred tank reactor are very heavily dictated by mass transfer requirements and reaction kinetics .	53.78138594613655

So the form of substrate and form of enzyme will dictate the choice .	65.35927754934094

This is dead end .	106.68153283572846

I am just moving it fast , because this just information I my aim is to just give you the generic synthetic procedure for this class of step polymers .	252.39916264304804

This pathway is represented by this and this .	64.71575717842987

and also enzyme is very stable because it is experiencing the aqueous environment .	134.63628768624375

If the chain has same molecular weight but lower V h lower size for more compact coil which we can imagine for a applicable or which we will get for a branched polymer .	149.1289279869078

One more time F 1 is the mole fraction of the pre monomer in the reaction medium , and F 1 , capital f of upper case , is the mole fraction of M 1 , in the copolymer .	54.35732758001261

First thing happen is , surface scattering or reflection , and because of that there will be loss of intensity , of the light passing through the main material , and scattering from rough surface , also will lead to reduction in the clarity of the material , and of course , increase in the haze .	137.0054167598507

There are many other unfavorable interactions available at the active site and these interactions tend to distort the substrate in such a way so that it favors the formation of a complex which is analogues to structure in transition state .	29.21518532885279

So , you can understand that in this case , always the ends will have a functional group of A , which cannot react with each other .	37.504197322432404

So , I can write q for m 1 q for m 2 for 1 , 1 , 1 e m 2 , you can get the expression from k 1 1 for k 1 1 k 2 and so the ratio you get these two , this because is the same radical 1 and 1 .	183.09672394233147

They are identical in terms of confirmation .	83.51640848050688

So , if you look tri ethyl amine the value is higher for acrylonitrile than vinyl acetate .	121.68963823294855

Now , the second mechanism , which is a monometallic which is proposed by Cossee and Arlman .	173.27506485779577

So , in that case , chemist has to design the monomers such a way that the reaction , equilibrium reaction or equilibrium constant is higher .	30.73664540148757

We talk more about polymer crystallinity .	115.57040752387542

Now , it can be expressed , we have expressed earlier in two components , it contains two components ; one is enthalpic excess and more enthalpy and one excess and more entropy .	225.11078787902412

By now one thing you must have noticed that what we are considering here that when you are finding the probability p , we are just taking that the chance or the probability of one cell being vacant is the number of vacant cell divided by the total number of cells .	70.79339469497633

In x mar , the number of groups , a structure , x structure , also number of groups will be x .	232.46063112183933

The fatty acid or whatever lipid molecule you have used for making the micelle , they are arranged such that the hydrophobic heads are diverted inside which form a structure and tails are extruding outside and then you disperse it through the use of surfactant and you have an interface here consisting mainly of the hydrophobic tails which remains very stable in the organic medium .	366.27515285534037

Now , as we said the least energy would preferred around dihedron angle 0 and or both the sides , so in that case you can , this term would be more than one , so this term due to bond rotational restriction will be higher than the term , which was for the other end - to - end distance , where it has only bond angle restrictions .	67.3689411098795

Now , we can easily write other from this expression .	44.72864187607079

Number of initiator molecules can be used .	30.3627197016895

They are they do not change the T g with molecular weight .	21.535967718060366

Then another problem is instability to denaturation in biological fluids and proteolytic attack .	933.9935747774134

For therapeutic purposes economics is secondary because primary is the ……… system , the safety of the system .	783.3316457609816

The slope also means the apparent km .	76.05615218891162

In today ’ s class what we will do , is to go through the other properties , like optical properties , electrical properties , barrier properties , and environmental properties , surface properties .	80.64596624226793

I think we will stop here and continue to discuss the behavior of enzyme reactors .	30.605199939147727

Obviously , the target application has to be kept in mind , which , for which application we want to use that additive .	86.06250261402785

These are the few examples of the ligands which are present in the metallocenes .	56.74793209900716

Now , this can also react with , or photo sensitize another molecule ; for example , if I have , from here , if I have another molecules , and if Ar is Ph .	129.9558481381852

The basic difference was while the lock and key mechanism or hypothesis proposed both the components to be rigid , in the Koshland induced fit model it was very clearly understood that the substrate may be rigid but the enzyme active sites are not rigid conformations as you can see here .	92.4365761399372

Before taking of the final design or analysis of the reactor system one need to look at the reactor performance equation based on actual reaction kinetics which is applicable and in this case I can site you the reference .	82.59666539340076

So it is a form of recycle reactor just like we saw in the case of total recycle packed bed which operates the batch reactor or even in continuous reactor recycle reactors can be used where part of the output stream is recycled and part is taken out as the product .	92.75835804916935

Typically , you have a pi bond , is converting to a sigma bond during this chain polymerization , or which is starting from a double bond .	36.537984257026345

So , if you can from the weight loss , we can get some idea about whether that this type of reaction is happening .	41.9137240727185

So , managing the heat , generate , generation or the heat generation during the polymerization is quiet not difficult .	660.3327617091238

If you talk about the case , we just talked about say r 1 less than 1 and r 2 is also less than 1 , what will happen ?	20.178197597672497

The batch reactor can be used both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme.You can carry out a batch reactor in a stirred mode or in a packed bed mode with using total recycle and on the right hand side is the characteristic profile of the reaction species that is the substrate and product with reference to time .	53.492463668705305

This rate equation again has to be verified with more experimental data .	276.13290964327894

In case if the fraction of conversion required is very high if you are looking for a 99 % conversion , it will be desirable to use a plug flow reactor with a partial recycle .	26.07582985167858

This means you know also P which is close to 1 .	58.58262862526219

So , as a result the T g drops .	20.645260886702182

If suppose the carrier cannot be regenerated and it has to be replaced the replacement of carrier is much simpler in the case of CSTR .	41.59263372583624

sk1 does not form E .	382.58305189447935

It will be mixture of that , but average will be say , a dimer for an equilibrium constant of 1 and for an equilibrium constant of 10 to the power 2 order .	96.38057216212479

So , entropy of the polymerization is combination of propagation initiation , as well as , termination .	105.02389733068453

Now , you seen that it can be shown that the radius of gyration can be found from the r m s , root mean square , the r m s end to end distance ; and as I said earlier , the r m s end to end distance is useful for our elasticity and the radius of gyration useful for directly relevant to dilute solution properties and light scattering and it can also useful for branched molecules and cyclic molecules .	51.61668199720751

But in majority you know the major volume of polymer comes out in from the manufacturing plants , goes in the application where polymer is the major part you know , is a application of polymers is major .	254.17901765682495

So , so other protonic acids like H 2 SO 4 or say , HClO 4 or phosphoric acid .	1425.3906032073053

The dialysate removes the metabolites , urea in this case and the urea level in the blood is brought down , then the conventional way .	398.88952733482

Then another area where probably cost or the process of economics is not important is the medical or therapeutic applications where the effectiveness is a very important aspect and in many cases even immobilized enzymes have found way in medical or therapeutic applications .	208.46463773968406

So , the concentration of the species , which is forming intra - molecular reaction , which is carrying out , which is undergoing intra - molecular reactions to form cyclic also come down .	51.79636233123231

The total sum will be the sigma on the denominator .	185.28678238640035

Now , these steps are part of propagation .	110.10565449493508

So , though this is a natural polymer , but if we imagine monomers like this from which they are formed and in this case because you imagine or you hypothesized that these are formed to a condensation reaction , most of this natural polymers are classified as a condensation polymer .	87.81275857209373

This is dissociation constant and KB and KA indicated here are the concentration of the substrates A and B respectively at which the reaction velocity is half the maximum reaction velocity at saturating level of the other substrate .	68.090159234743

As far as the regulation of enzyme synthesis is concerned most of the enzymes are regulated entities .	59.97128111225277

The other analytical application sector was as a therapeutic agent and with development in the availability of different enzymes and particularly the understanding of molecular basis of deceases the use of enzymes as therapeutic agents is by and large increasing .	234.6846274504111

Milk contains primarily lactose as a principle sugar and this lactose is an undesirable sugar for certain adults .	7154.372120202521

This is only one of probably a large number of relationships that are reported in the literature of heterogeneous catalysis in chemical engineering .	84.09190968085264

So , if you compare between the , within the , let me write down , write down these things , so in a polar solvent you have , say contact .	76.12131613020249

We will discuss the techniques like membrane osmometry , vapor pressure osmometry , and end group analysis .	41.730585286187534

You get a high , very high molecular polyethylene .	20.224353381222546

So , you can use ultem as your material ; obviously , these polymers are costly , because they have , so high performance and they are also difficult to synthesize there are the same time much costlier then the common polymers .	190.11769158148

If you decrease the temperature , now whether that also simultaneously increases the rate of the polymerization that depends on the value of the activation energy for reactions .	60.702992926007035

But ultimately this cycling is not continuous over a long period of time and that is still inherent problem .	164.28011397251896

So , in this case , this two moles of chain which underwent disproportionation reaction , you have total number of , this has each one has one residues initiator residues and this has two initiator residues .	130.33906106768217

Pure monomer is getting converted to a pure polymer which is completely amorphous or slightly crystalline .	88.06194314248145

So , polymerization does not take place in the monomer droplet , actually if you stop the reaction after sometime , you will find that less than 1 percent , actually less than 0.01 percent polymerization polymerization happens in the monomer droplet .	85.51949622023712

Now , typically E transfer is higher than E p , so which means , that with T , with increase in , decrease in temperature C also goes down , which means , X n goes up .	80.6228781190466

In fact in many cases in the chemical analysis detection of D - amino acid is difficult because it gets destroyed .	92.58961711981216

By knowing the two slopes one can calculate klam .	519.7791204928147

So , you have much larger or broader molecular weight polymers .	82.71460367315055

So , it basically purify the blood and also pump into the body .	278.02644648133423

So what we will have , we will have a composition drift , which means the copolymers which form at the beginning they will have different composition , than the copolymers which are forming at the later part of the copolymerization reaction , so is have so you can understand that the monomer content in the copolymers will be different , then the feed ratio at the beginning , and with time the monomer composition will be different , from the beginning , and there will be composition drift .	49.64023057178851

Another source of non - ideality could be that the reactor may have some kind of dead zone because of the improper mixing and this dead zone is V.f2 .	238.1115392885787

What is the structure microstructure of the polymer , and also most important is what is the molecular weight of the polymers which we made , and what are the as you know that polymers seldom have unique ; all the polymers chains have same molecular weight .	49.05675168223323

And those are the same types of initiators will be used to basically polymerize the cyclic rings and make a ring opening polymerization .	48.45676012329

And as we discussed it will give you a syndiotactic polymer , syndiotactic methyl methacrylate .	40.20372338305218

So , this is in a actual case if the rate of polymerization depends on the conversation , now obviously this gel effect whether it will exists or if exists at what conversion that will depend upon the viscosity of the medium .	86.75507817815411

This 2 path is shown here .	121.37645025366041

A large number of correlations giving the values of C and n have been proposed under different conditions and one of them which needs the actual reaction conditions can be chosen from the literature and used for estimation of JD .	92.48120208233681

Even in chemical engineering that is very conventional thing ; only difference is that those catalysts are very , very stable interms of their thermal , operational as well as storage stability where as immobilized enzymes are not as stable .	227.94316857533596

Typical substrate binding energies range from 3 - 12 kcal mol - 1 .	640.3921181836064

That means magnitude by which the dissociation constant of binding of inhibitor is modified can be determined .	41.23992290050577

So , the contour length would be multiplied this by the number of bonds .	48.61292061511236

And if they are well separated , obviously , there will not be any possibility of such type of intermediate formation and hence as usual the trans product will be predominant .	29.439245348286835

One is the transport of substrate from the surface to the enzyme active site and then reverse will be transport of product .	34.751190816015246

Now , if we talk about the big polymer manufacturers like DuPont , Dow Chemicals , SABIC , Bayer they are manufacturer of polymers .	946.0142204238637

You have to take the monomer and a initiator which is soluble in the monomer .	27.49342885138609

So , just recap last 2 lectures , we discussed in detail effect of temperature on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight .	20.545272711329048

These enzymes are often involved in many of the constitutive functions of a living cell where the cell wants a very broad specificity and thatís why the nature has evolved these group specific enzymes .	118.38928261608366

Like in the case of lipase or protease , water can be the second substrate or it could be the second substrate itself to yield the desired product .	128.34800931941405

So , if you increase the conversation that may be more and more polymer forming less and less monomer present in the medium then means the T g of the polymer present is becoming higher and higher because you are reducing the amount of monomer present in the media .	48.30310452538297

So , this is a cis product .	9.937295053505435

So , these all are very easy to name in our conventional way as polyethylene terephthalate .	119.92629444459565

Except for that difference there will be no difference and the reaction profile will be hyperbolic in nature and one can examine such a situation in the case of a variety of identical independent subunits .	58.940817080835025

So , basically we are talking about pendent group size , we are not talking about this , we are talking about pendent group size and type .	20.818180631326918

So therefore the tow the space velocity or the space time can be given by the same design expression which was used for idealized enzyme reactors excepting that the effectiveness factor for a case has been multiplied to the system .	92.73519902793167

And here stress is linked to the rate of change of strain with time , and the proportionality constant is the viscosity .	91.0053034883657

Now , if you consider even higher theta value and you consider a theta like this which is higher than theta two then the phase difference between the two scattered light is even higher .	45.68919957775543

The M 1 will get incorporated in the chain at a much faster rate .	18.13438744644034

That means equilibrium constant is the one where the rate of forward reaction and the backward reaction are identical and the equilibrium constant the value of the concentration of product upon substrate at v = 0 will be Keq = [ P ] eq / [ S ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 or in terms of the basic kinetic parameters Keq = [ P ] eq / [ S ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 = vs.kp / ks.vp The expression can be arrived from the main rate expression which will give you the equilibrium constant either in terms of the rate constant .	61.18840135624946

So , this is the expression for theta equals to c is equals to 0 .	9.719518563098726

The effect of pH is linked to the ionization state of the enzyme active site .	14.321831203578759

So , even if you stopped at the very beginning with a very low conversation at say 5 percent , you see high molecular weight , polymers , monomers and the initiator in the medium .	61.42000887232834

So this is also another set of monomers , which can be easily polymerized , by a anionic initiator .	10.330064354349908

I will cover in brief the reaction of polymers which include polymer degradation , stabilization and also polymer modifications and at the end I have planned to brief you about few new topics , and special topics and new development in polymer chemistry and at the end I will complete with a summary of this course .	272.80379269086274

These are three possibilities , this is not happened very practically , but these two are very common in practice .	194.66144347271862

Or on the other hand if the biochemical reaction rate is very , very slow compared to diffusion or diffusion is very fast you might have a reasonable concentration of substrate even at the centre of the particle and therefore the apparent loss of enzyme activity may not be serious .	44.72578526607932

So , how to get the value for M v ?	10.86745805893967

If you can think of that the next carbon also have same configuration and if they alternate , then they are called syndiotactic , this is isotactic and if there is no order , then it is called atactic which is basically random distribution .	112.56783625393211

if you increase the time the polymer molecular weight will be higher and higher .	22.12170008349591

Styrene , you get polystyrene .	707.5707170389651

Had this reaction not been reversible totally then the term p will become zero , irreversible reaction .	1123.5639890145821

It has been de linked from its natural habitat and when we take an enzyme sample in a buffer , its natural structure function may not be identical as it happens in the living cell and that has been recognized very well .	152.30113162723922

The antibodies and enzyme molecules in terms of their dissociation constant for their counter part in the case of enzymes it is substrate in case of anti bodies , they are antigens .	115.5565955681543

The Km apparent , if you consider K ’ m as Km apparent varies with the hydrogen ion concentration .	67.89942783078563

Now , let us , we know , that at different state of aggregation we have discussed earlier , that this ion - pairs present in different state of aggregation forms a tight ion - pair to solvent separated ion - pair to completely free ion - pair .	50.86094124092504

And the rates the rate materials , in terms of different , this gives the different ratings like V 0 V 1 V 2 H B and those things .	432.7147504046171

As I said in the first class itself that structure units and repeat units are different , and it will become more clear , I just give 2 examples .	42.621907192105205

This temperature has mainly three consequences ; one is the optimum temperature of the reaction .	108.58775370344101

And the , now let us talk about the third type of initiation , which is that photo initiation or photo chemical reactions , photo initiation .	70.85023646981365

That means certain functional group on the substrate will bind to certain active sites and the active sites will have certain catalytic sites which will interact with the functional residues on the substrate molecule which has to undergo change , the bonds that has to be broken .	36.377135854534444

So , at the one more time , at the end of stage I you have large monomer droplets stabilized by the absorption of surfactant molecules of course , the this size has sunk from the beginning , you have the initiator molecules still present in the in the solution , you have monomer molecules as well .	47.991585240607414

In this case chloride ; there , their interaction with the monomer ; steric and electronic interaction with the monomer actually determines the orientation of the coordination monomers .	112.50230037413625

They are proven to hydrolyze .	257.7227327001448

There will be no biasness of M 1 sitting next to M 2 , or M 1 seating next to M 1 .	231.5219479737662

So , these are basically block copolymers , which have a long sequence of two different monomers .	60.742740485115185

Vander Waal forces the attractive forces resulting from favorable interaction between dipoles is a very important component in the conformation of a protein .	294.63968874174714

They are presenting the maximum number , but its weight reach matters most , not the number in terms of polymer property is .	484.52006046327796

That means if it is a three enzyme species system , if there are three enzyme species in the system then each path way must consist of two steps which can form the enzyme species E or any enzyme species which we are considering .	36.35324483113709

Now , there are other step there are several other step polymers , which you know because of time or this course of this polymers is not to go through the detailed synthesis procedure of this polymers .	79.27721821737607

And between e and f this is the change of slope , sorry this is slope and this is the rate of change of slope this change of is coming in positive direction here , and negative direction here .	168.89661906424323

For example , if I take a… This again coming back to the example of polyester .	51.43365339356833

It does not come back to the original state , or end there is not any recovery at all , so this is a perfect viscous material .	27.530996777102647

A major application sector is industrial catalysis whereby we replace a chemical catalyst for carrying out a chemical transformation to produce a desired product .	321.25678304564514

I write this as AA and this as BB .	180.02278284626925

So within a limited pH range at which the right kind of amino acid residues are ionized the native confirmation of the protein is maintained .	72.1446396764179

So , you want the polymer material to be behave as barrier to that perfume whatever is there inside .	371.37836843025707

So we will discuss this process in coming pages .	32.20741311265597

Thus the product has to come back from the reaction site to the surface and then to the bulk .	83.10560786657715

So the net effect on the maximum reaction rate is experienced .	59.26396200067091

Another example of a competitive inhibitor is sulfanilamide which is a sulpha drug .	68.78254086172937

And compare this vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate , which is basically as we have known from our earlier discussions done in several times .	187.47528667496323

This is very true very often in the case of reversible reactions and in such cases the Michaelis Menten kinetics will also be valid provided the interconversions of the intermediate complexes are the rate limiting step .	70.13181953097585

So , we can analyze the amount of dyes present , we can also analyze specialized additives which are , where the additives are UV visible active .	219.93211297583053

So , if the polymer while vaporization is gets fragmented or degraded then while we get the molecular ion distribution , we do not know the distribution is because of the fragmentation or degradation of the high polymer chain or because of the actual presence of the low molecular weight chain in the samples .	149.44683198186567

Now the confirmation or the configuration of the polymer chain will be determined by the confirmation of the adding monomer which the monomer which is getting added .	42.501601877909366

And then went randomly , did a random of fixed step length of one length , and then using radial distribution function Gaussian , what is the probability that the other end would be at a distance r from the origin .	106.34486173987486

The aggregates will be insoluble and they can be used as immobilized preparation which can be readily separated from the lipid phase .	167.6830659741839

so in this case the entropy change is also lower , so if you think about the thermo dynamics of this chain polymerization , briefly , at this movement , because this is exothermic negative , and this is also negative , so there is a completion between these two term .	66.38140039944123

Whereas 6 member ring is not that feasible to or basically it is not feasible to polymerize thermodynamically .	136.3246921843389

And they are jointly awarded the Noble prize in Chemistry .	1813.3799413572692

Whereas this correspondence to , the 80 percent of free monomer M 1 in the reaction mixture , while this is correspondence to 80 percent of the monomer aim in the co polymer .	42.98997929815481

So , again this is meaning , this means that if you want to build a high molecular weight , always better to take out the condensate out from the system .	20.17783175472168

I will give you a specific example .	15.72670444685313

It consists of stirred reactor in which silicon tubing is dispersed into the organic phase and silicon tubing , while it is non - porous to most of the substrates and the products , but it is porous to water vapors and what we do is through silicon tubings we recirculate a saturated salt solution which is known to have a definite water activity .	353.6052538595404

For step polymerization , this is very important because it will end up in most cases , PDI is 2 .	74.08045667252017

Because , the number of micelles are much more huge compared to the monomer droplets , obviously even though the sizes of the micelles are smaller than the monomer droplets , the total surface area or the micelles are considerably higher compared to the total surface area of the monomer droplets .	46.30552695975589

For example is example of metallocenes , where you have two side ; two cyclopentadienyl coordinated with , attached with iron .	772.4506586410179

So , how this is possible ?	35.522541279756744

As soon as the binary complex forms a product is released and the modified enzyme then interacts with the second substrate and the second product is formed .	31.348710812883315

Once the substrate binds to one of the binding sites in some cases the binding site might induce a conformational change thereby making the affinity of the substrate molecule to the other binding sites more favorable or some times unfavorable .	69.22714805409133

That means the sizes of the polymer chains are smaller .	23.350936895740418

Monomers , we talked about several times monomers .	290.04027137005323

So , now what we will do is we will explain or we will try to learn how the Paul Flory , Huggins theory was established using that same lattice theory which we just learnt for small molecules .	76.89768393645438

That was the only assumption .	150.53002627581006

Welcome to this seventh lecture of this course on polymer chemistry .	26.15098763025994

If I take the axis , the carboxylic group , what will land up in ?	89.54674871908303

So , this is this molecules even if they are thermo dynamically feasible they do not undergo polymerization .	30.295563454444174

So , in the expression of this m V we just found out that it is having the expression of this .	41.46838244767903

Because the carriers are functionalized they are attached with the protein and when enzyme confirmation is lost protein is still coupled to them in the deactivated form .	427.46433255339616

So , light stabilizer must ; basically we talked about 2 types of light stabilizer - one , which can absorb the UV light and protect the bulk of the polymer from UV light ; and second we talked about HALS , which basically prevent the oxidation process or the radical process , and prevent the molecular weight degradation .	84.97928787832609

Experimentally you cannot determine the vm value because it is a saturation rate asymptotic to the axis and therefore you can never reach that value experimentally .	191.84103867404747

We will talk about the simplest model , which is known as terminal model .	41.9648490496221

Now what mean by chain dimension ?	152.67184065804554

These are the different techniques and what I have done is I have just listed the principles and some of these techniques are absolute techniques ; that means we do not require any calibration by the polymers of no molecular weight .	80.26579224853675

That is the order which it goes and it is a fairly large range .	117.5498423866216

So , if you stop the reaction in the beginning , you will see a lot of these high conformation conversion , but a lot of these small oligomers .	40.8969446055513

Only then it depends on the magnitude of time .	53.96446886655011

I try to write this one using the same you will arrive at for the same expression as Michaelis Menten equation .	78.02158203166861

If the enzyme loading is constant , then the tau will also have the similar ratio because in our reactor performance equation the left hand side is K2E0 ?	66.86435974202644

And to maintain the same temperature the heat or energy is supplied to the sample .	48.01012322639445

Let us say a substrate has to undergo reaction which has three functional group represented by Rí , Ríí or Rííí .	83.7839609575825

The reason that we cannot get the calibration curve made for all the polymers , because we cannot get narrow dispersed polymer for all types of polymers ; specially , for coordination polymers , for polycarbonate polyesters , polyamides that is very difficult to synthesize narrow dispersed polymers which SPI is 1.1 or less than that it is very difficult ; and unless we have a narrow dispersed or mono dispersed samples which can be retry standards we cannot use this for calibration .	127.47997031642943

Things like O 2 , CO 2 , they actually inhibit the anionic chain polymerization by forming a peroxyl , peroxyl or carboxyl anion , which are very weak nucleophile , which cannot reinitiate a new anionic chain , so these are inhibitors .	602.2330679118046

If your environmental pH is alkaline , seven plus , the isomerisation can take place naturally and the isomerisation product will not be only fructose but it will be plus few other hexoses which will be produced and the whole advantage of using an enzymatic process is lost .	401.99580106923383

So , we can write n i , this is M I .	25.444512483263146

But enzyme loss can be there big time , over a long period of time .	144.1840531089827

So , as a result more complicated products actually form when there is type of hydride shift or some cases methide shift , some cases shift one two methide shift .	612.0023643398864

So , basically that will give us some idea , if we keep that polymer material at that particular temperature for long time , as especially in elevated temperature , where there is some degradation or decomposing happening or not .	202.23053992605085

One of the sides is blocked .	15.907666781072555

km k2 E + S E S E + P + I ki EI Then the same free enzyme molecule binds to the inhibitor and gives you EI .	70.58228653223323

Now , in this crystal as I said , this is a octahedrally coordinated .	115.77859682029174

If you know k and a ; if k and a are known , obviously you can find experimentally the value of intrinsic viscosity and then if you know k and a value , then you will be able to find the value for M v .	29.171299553896638

No . It cannot form a peptide bond .	218.6868578338292

Because of the nature of certain non - polar side chains to drift away from the water molecule , which in the case of an enzyme solution is usually water , it causes the non polar side chains to burry inside the core .	89.61503257329431

A major application of immobilized cells has been in isomerisation of glucose to fructose and the process is only techno economically viable because it can be used in the form of immobilized cells .	85.58734834507815

So , that is the root mean square end to end distance .	4.039480997418357

And from that we can get the values of m , this one m m , r and r r .	26.816345392002454

So , if you have ring stability order , then you have 3 member rings , 4 member ring .	358.1052496463202

So , now , we basically know these are the mechanism of Zeigler - Natta polymerization .	26.432051090272346

All variety of those functions at a molecular level has become an added dimension which has been at the center of the bio technology in general .	186.64445569874894

It will be expressed in the cyclic form by a triangle each enzyme species represented on the vertex of the triangle and each of the path way which should be considered for the formation of enzyme species must have n - 1 steps .	121.91215320830793

There are mainly two motivating factors .	198.10873887048336

Now , how can you think of which one is dominant product or which one is not a dominant product ?	116.62766679505339

One of the important aspects is that unlike synthetic macromolecules which we are familiar in our day to day life say polythene or styrene they are all linear chain molecules , long linear chain molecules , hydrocarbon residue of monomers .	727.557726590599

If you talk about the molecular at the beginning of the reaction , that is quite different than the molecular weight of the polymers which are at the end of the reaction .	11.466229449749447

So , it is always your solvent or the mediums should be such that your function groups are always accessible , should be always accessible to react .	230.19909520928485

The mechanism and the kinetics in case of emulsion polymerization do not follow a normal chain reaction polymerization kinetics or mechanism , as was the case for the earlier 4 , 5 process , we just talked about this mechanism and kinetics for emulsion process are quiet different and complex , and still not completely understood .	174.4750372362315

You see the particles shown here ; let us say a kind of a spherical particle not perfectly sphere but something which can be assumed to be spherical and with a network of pores within the particle and the enzyme is located while on the surface as well as on the bulk of the enzyme .	137.58442580635298

So , the molecules , now we just talked about this theoretical number or this expression for this simple polyethylene molecule ; now if you have side groups obviously , this rotational restriction will be higher , because the polymer will be much more stiffer than polyethylene molecules , so rotational restriction will be higher .	82.43931883418722

Here we require the value for delta H molar heat of vaporization and with the help of cryoscopy which deals with the depression of freezing point where we can get the same T 0 T f ; T 0 is the freezing point of the solvent , T f is the freezing point of the solution where we need the molar enthalpy of freezing or melting .	166.59179273597528

Then obviously , in any given opportunity , the polymer will try to release that stress , and one opportunity of its come contact with the chemical , it might release that stress , by cracking or crazing and so on .	268.7665249327409

Now , we the stiffness can be also measured by , if you get this term , this term is basically the ratio of the unperturbed dimension divided by the dimension for a freely rotating chain .	48.47982167175582

The two equations which you can apply , this T g is for the resulting co polymer , or the blend , visible blend , which is given by W 1 T g 1 plus W 2 T g 2 .	111.96110662620778

We also saw that the active site will include the binding process .	39.33150122011371

So , if you just look at this curve one more time , the melting is a first order transition , where G varies with temperature , the x - axis is the temperature , with G varies continuously with temperature and the first derivative of G , V , H , S , they varies discontinuously .	107.05198883437686

And r is the fraction of pairs of adjacent of repeat units that are present in syndiotactic geometry .	60.8530968687525

If in this case , A is the functional group present in a smaller quantity , the fraction of a group which has reacted is defined as the conversion .	26.563611465149503

If you have a molecules which have only one functionality for example , instead of ethylene glycol you have a phenol molecules , then once this weights of phenol is reacted you , the chain does not goes , you you cannot make a polymers .	125.75163180729218

Now , if we take say an ideal copolymerization where r 1 r 2 is 1 if r 1 is higher than 1 and r 2 is less than 1 , then 2 monomers will get into the chain in random fashion , but monomer M 1 will be entering in the chain at the faster rate as compared to M 2 .	90.76551236120937

So , this is expected that at low conversion the polydispersity will between 1.5 to 2 .	88.17095408024606

In the lab , there are more sophisticated statistical method and which are computerized .	341.73113357957845

They could be on the same site where the substrate binds or even they could be on a site in proximity of that or in such a way that the binding of the substrate is influenced .	46.350990643734995

But if you consider the overall productivity of the immobilized enzyme that means the yield of the immobilization after considering the operational stability it still remains a desirable method .	82.09568648194855

When I say catalyst that means not all proteins will qualify to be called enzymes .	233.96864609360668

So , in this case ethylene oxide you must put a bracket that the monomer inside the bracket and then prefix the term poly .	59.21359972559895

R O P by name as the name suggests it is a ring opening polymerization , so you have ring in monomer having ring structure and you polymerize it , and make a linear polymer .	111.5648274433379

There could be some peroxides or hydro peroxides , which also when act as a initiator , they participated in chain transfer reaction and resulting decrease of molecular weight , example of X A is monomer methyl methacrylate dot , it is not the methyl methacrylate .	188.72840757988138

With that concept he was able to determine the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex formation .	34.04423704597396

So obviously you have to produce them on a very small scale and producing on small scale will lead to high cost of production .	86.58835604350885

In the case of PET .	20.421319190029877

So , you need to know the concentration of each monomers very well .	31.100537607900602

It operates almost like a packed bed system .	121.87566887164631

Next we will consider desirable operational parameters .	146.66874187280234

Now obviously if these two blocks , in a block co polymers or say two homopolymers in blends are partially visible , then what happens , you still gets two T g s , for a two component system , but if T gs comes down from the corresponding homopolymers , you get a somewhere intermediates .	221.04805278523597

The two major attributes of an enzyme molecule is the chemical nature of the protein and their catalytic function .	38.84336955714818

So , we will talk about kinetic .	13.811102536838742

X.S0 is the total product formed and tau is the space time per unit time , the amount of product formed per unit time .	55.872388970950674

Starch hydrolysis also shows a similar behavior ; gelatinous it is not insoluble like particulate matter , but still it is in the form of a gel and after you cook the starch you get a gel and the gel has to be reacted with the soluble enzyme to carry out the liquefaction .	166.59358536130884

Vs is the maximum reaction velocity corresponding to substrate .	251.8429179667603

Now , we can extend these examples .	105.00016764020779

And this is these are the trade names of this polymers in this trade name they are sold Radel and Udel .	97.96234058071781

For example , you take specific example of amines , they can react with this propagating species and form a complex , such in this case this cationic species is very stable and they are nonreactive towards the monomer .	90.6870266647734

So , that is , what is the chance that each segment would be giving up a polymer solvent contact .	20.664557458260376

There are hundreds of such examples I can give , maybe I will give in later classes , but I hope you are convinced that polymers is finding applications in several places and now a days when we talk about you know we , a scientist or the developer you know application specialist with thing for a new material application .	219.8564227763667

KE * = K * .	59662.0853354407

So , now we have this vacant orbital .	67.92860424667175

Now , there could be other points which are also having the same distance r ; you can have other values r across this three d coordinate .	153.8921770395321

That means that becomes almost similar parameter like what you considered in case of a soluble enzyme that is specific activity .	112.58611184742013

The basic concept is you have to choose an appropriate combination of biological and transducing elements that means choose a biological agents ; we are emphasizing on immobilized enzymes which will recognize the anylate .	278.3526270592952

F1 that is the line corresponds to F 1 is f 1 .	144.21175648324817

The reaction may stop as soon as some concentration of the product and hydrogen ions are built up .	159.7751363588211

Because this is constant , this is constant .	50.405374613200415

Reactor performance from RTD also can be obtained and one can compare if you consider the ideal reactor flow profile and also the real reactor flow profile and compare their performance and comparison will give you the deviation from the ideality .	193.57645987394048

Most important non covalent interaction which involves in the conformation of the protein molecule is hydrogen bonds , very large number of hydrogen bonds .	102.1956613949972

Because , the concentration of monomer also goes down , concentration on initiator also goes down , but as the concentration initiator goes down faster than the monomer , so effectively the monomer molecular weight increases .	143.58715393319184

R p 1 is given by k p 1 , M 1 dot , M plus , R 2 is given by k p 2 , M 2 dot , M plus , so on ; and , this R p n is given by k p n , M n dot , M .	11.269047146506603

So , basically , trap the radicals and form non radical process , and by which they prevent degradation of molecular weight , and formation of the yellow colour bodies .	45.17619391234469

Typically , we present a polymer distribution at weight fraction versus molecular weight .	77.52816990339163

The concentration of any specie of a reaction system is homogeneous same at every point in the reactor and that is equal to the concentration at the product stream because it is a perfectly mixed system .	48.41900607856245

So , the size of this monomer is becoming smaller and smaller , and will vanish at the end of stage II , so at the stage II you have only this particles , no surfactant , free surfactant micelles , neither you have free droplets .	269.13942889110467

So this gives you a picture of the process economics and the contribution of different factors in the operation of an immobilized enzyme processes .	34.02850773815217

An initiation consist of 2 steps : 1 - initiator molecules produce 2 radical species , which is the initiating radical or is called the primary radical .	182.17274874748097

Now we will discuss , or define this term , clarity and haze in a minute .	94.67385799539548

Of course if you have a cationic then you have an anionic counter ion .	19.40659518059122

That means if you take a soluble enzyme , add to a carrier and allow it by any method of immobilization we get two streams - one will be residual enzyme activity in the supernatant which is left uncoupled and immobilized enzyme preparation .	81.15900688056009

The other important polymers in this family is poly chloride .	179.31519908422732

So , if you have prior knowledge of your solubility parameter of the polymer and solvent then you can narrow down the polymers , before you go the exact trail .	139.41853094060397

This A and B both have to colloid and make an unstable compound .	229.5612704049603

The kind of kinetics the reaction follows dictates very often the choice of reactor types , the design parameters for the reactor and they all involve enzyme kinetics and that becomes quite important tool for reactor design .	142.38937454289118

If you look at these numbers here , k P k d to the power half k t to the power half , here k d is in the down .	36.09827976619038

In the case of polystyrene this is repeating unit and this is also a structure unit because structural units is the unit which is derived from a monomer .	43.66182823102111

Obviously one tribu butyne has much more stabilization .	250.96919798133837

We have also not considered the deactivation of the enzyme on the reactor performance .	13.045063279081637

While in the case of PFR or the plug flow reactor the regeneration of the carrier is simple because after the immobilized enzyme is exhausted one can stop for a while regenerate the carrier , reimmobilize the system and reuse .	99.10190346358205

k2 / Km is a combined parameter for the biocatalysis but D is a diffusional parameter so it is physically some parameter which defines the ratio between the two and by adjusting either numerator or increasing or decreasing the numerator or the denominator one can regulate the controlling parameter .	373.1303611542776

l value greater than two F is approximately 1 / ?	194.86309769255192

That means that the rate will increase rate of polymerization will be , will increase with increase in temperature .	20.1957601501263

So , it will have much lower del H value .	11.822970270784557

So , what is done in practice ?	16.742703323174645

All this mechanical properties depends on temperature of experiment , and the strain rate or the stress rate .	71.52982623679979

When I say cheap I am referring to comparable cost of other enzymes and therefore it is used usually in soluble batch process at a very high temperature because the alpha amylase is a very thermo stable enzyme and can be operated at temperatures even hundred plus and therefore the gel gets immediately liquefied .	232.25307895381454

Now , what happened in case of polymer ?	7.8153226517064995

In this lecture thirteen , we plan to cover effect of temperature on rate of polymerization and molecular weight , and also we will start our discussion on thermodynamics of chain growth polymerization .	26.294728795567217

The molecules have to reach to this state of the energy so that the transition state can form and then it can be broken down to form the enzyme and the product .	36.30782180446663

So , every real polymer chain will have restriction of bond angle and also restriction for the single rotation around the single bond .	61.77951218962422

So , what you need so you need a hetero atom in the ring in the cycling wave , which we have a ring like say ether molecule see this ether or a ester or say a amide they might can do there is if you use asilo base they can actually do nucleophilic or electrophilic attack on this ring and reopen .	314.42814699945404

But this is not common ; this is especially applicable to some monomers .	198.01487470591837

Now a solution in the solvent , chemical potential is lower than in the solvent so the vapor pressure of the solvent in the polymer solution will lower .	33.21525304289812

A number of enzyme catalyzed reactions have been reported like lipases for ester synthesis , interesterifications , transesterifications and resolution of racemic mixtures .	178.41254565742557

So , yield strength and the elastic modulus is becomes higher , if it is a flexible back bone obviously , reforming deformation is much easier so , modulus comes modulus come down .	255.80901097062906

So , like this curve , no matter what is your r , you can only reach up to this level .	33.3247308322106

So basically , only… what is the change here ?	117.27975006572683

The reaction velocity for such a reaction will be given by v = k3 ( ET ) – k - 3 [ E ] .	49.11026529645021

That means substrate concentration is almost hundred fold or more than the Km value .	30.89434806827358

And at some temperature , this deformation happens , and that particular temperature is known as heat deflection temperature .	84.35246046284

At a value of pH which is lesser than pK value of the ionisable residue , the Vm remains constant and at its original value .	76.60529476963193

Say , at low conversion that means at the beginning of the reaction low conversion X n bar is given by 1 by 1 minus P X w n given by 1 plus P 1 minus P and X w bar X n bar P D I given by 1 plus p .	36.946465576193845

Proper amount of loading : sometimes this additives function for a particular level of loading ; too less loading or might not be bring about the advantage which are the manufacturer looking for ; and too much of addition of the additive might destroy the polymer itself , and obviously , the cost of the formulation will go up .	396.8922405816741

klam kí2E0 Sb We have two different conditions of the Lineweaver Burk plot ; one in the case where Sb is very high and the Lineweaver Burk plot will have the slope as Kím / Vím On the other hand when the substrate concentration is very low the slope will be 1 / klam + Kím / Vím .	49.97313587919192

When this is C H 3 , if you have C H 3 group , the polymer chain becomes more stiffer .	49.90387776284945

You will get a fraction say 3.4 or 3.6 .	76.91091514573854

You know packaging films you have seen probably that when you stretch at the beginning , it takes a little difficult .	318.4857717549669

Polymers as I said , it is never , the polymer crystallinity is not never up to hundred percent , it is always up to semi - crystalline .	161.12797783105765

This is a process flow diagram that is still in operation in Japan and has been in operation since 1963 , the first system which came into being and is still being operated .	691.0381701128528

So , basically , these are the attributes , surface active additives must have to be successful in any application .	76.65465772433679

As in the very first reaction itself for example hexokinase will act on glucose as a substrate and produce the corresponding phosphorylated sugar .	64.60587278320025

The additives must be chosen , keeping in mind the chemical composition of polymer ; their additive must be comparable ; in the sense , that it should not react with the , with the polymer itself or it should not make harm to the polymer itself , which will deteriorate the polymer property .	96.1451538754317

This is poly acrylamide gel entrapment .	19.525342709883013

We come across variety of analytical situations whether in the area of research or even in the area of clinical analysis where the samples are analyzed in large numbers and be required to use very specific reactions that can be catalyzed by enzymes .	171.25480949381247

They can regenerate the carrier as and when the enzyme activity comes down ; even they can dissolve ; they can re - adsorb it and the carrier is fairly sturdy and it doesn ’ t get degenerated .	464.142629176825

If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come .	114.74504976544344

So , with the different pore size available and we always know that it is the polymers are not that distinct as this they are also having different size or different molecular weights .	86.41749548511844

Because , this is highly reactive , it will react both m and this , if it is less reactive , then the more reactive between this two will react with this .	52.898211045411465

That means enzyme concentration in the solid phase and not the E0 because as a result of conformational changes the enzyme concentration interms of activity can get altered .	58.70744465609246

When I talk of ternary complex formation I am referring to a ternary complex formation before the product is formed .	38.75733135650746

Termination can happen ; beta hydride termination to the transition metal .	260.98091519175034

Now , there is always an associated equilibrium value of the monomer .	39.52365515934916

So for that is the example A I B N is typically used as around 60 to 80 degree centigrade , and benzyl peroxide typical reaction temperature is between 80 to 95 degree centigrade .	35.93331241750702

When we say higher or less than the Km value , when we compare substrate concentration with the Km value , what we are looking at in the case of zero order regime , we often look at the Km value ; K ' m is usually less than 0.01 S0 .	42.16487546031391

This is all .	46.27609122156549

You may reach closer to it as you increase the substrate concentration .	83.9272830069838

What we will do now with the polymer ?	16.52077030557062

Now , if you decrease the temperature both , the normal propagation and this inter - molecular circulation slow down , decreases .	168.47778161684846

Big one cannot go inside the pore so , will come out fast and the smaller one can go inside the pores , and which will take more time to come out ; obviously , polymers chains are also having a distribution .	124.28076087913855

Similarly , this temperature you have spinodal points like here and here , this temperature you have here and here similarly , hear you can join them and get a spinodal curve .	207.6523874057951

In the last lecture we had studied the mechanism , the strategies by which we can control the molecular weight of a step polymer .	16.663679875076724

As you know , these would have higher reactivity and higher reaction compared to these and this has exothermic reaction .	130.5378668325264

Now , if we note , we define conversion or if conversion is P , now , how do you define conversion P ?	159.7344881632006

Due to thermo chemical reasons it might get inactivated but for some time it remains intact .	1215.3515328584438

Now , you can also argue , that as the reaction progresses , the monomer , the monomer concentration , in this case monomer means the species , which is forming the cyclic , that also comes down because you know , the time goes , the monomer molecule react .	75.22218752405911

Now , this at the interface react with phosgene forming this come out which again with reaction with this phenolate salt will form a dimer in this case and reaction will proceed further in this way .	107.23333736496852

In those days the alcoholic fermentation enzyme was called as zymase although that kind of nomenclature is no longer valid .	1260.7793465773116

You can actually deep that plastic material , in a liquid or similar refractive index .	136.46901453512797

Similarly there is increase in optimum temperature ; there is decrease in optimum temperature and there are cases where there are no changes also .	55.81158576676805

These two factors put together give you much higher catalytic efficiency as we noted in the case of one of the examples which I have illustrated to carry out the conversion of reactants into product .	50.82225648318448

The control of the enzyme reactors is rather difficult in the case of soluble enzyme batch processes or even immobilized enzyme batch processes and the control is much more effective in the case of a continuous flow reactor using immobilized enzyme .	45.74046932129411

These are the examples of big polymer industry where the the companies make the polymers in very large quantity , where the the applications where polymers find you know minor like examples I said where polymers are synthesized and added as a active or secondary ingredient in other formulations , those polymers are typically made by the smaller companies and they are taken , they are synthesized by the smaller companies .	287.6697274211315

Is that right ?	485.2538496774738

So , we need calibration and calibration is typically done .	59.159809972299044

Other than fructose , it will produce cyclose and galactose and all other sugars which are not desirable in the product .	278.37552873258505

So , we are writing R p as the rate of reaction , which is same as rate of propagation , whereas k p is the rate constant for propagation and E p is the activation energy for propagation .	21.249975495635

So , R p would be k p , M , k d , oxidant by reductant concentration by , twice k t to the power half .	53.37233269710985

Until then from the residual mixture we were isolating L - amino acid and the balance was almost wasted .	1034.7232909062677

Whereas , a flexible polymer will have very you know much higher elongational break , in terms of impact properties again , a stiff polymeric back bone , if you apply impact apply impact then , with a short time , the polymer cannot rearrange and absorb that energy .	283.1878853695332

So , if you have a coil and if this is the center of gravity then all the segments .	23.180788359685685

In both the cases the cis product is dominating .	51.43996428933342

So , you can now understand that if I plot say percentage conversion with d p degree of polymerization or say molecular weight or molecular weight in case of step growth polymerization , it will only start from a slow… So , in a very low conversion you know the high the the polymer chains only will be achieved , you know high molecular polymer chains will be only achieved at very high conversion close to 98 percentage above .	63.85500488316691

That means , typically these hang around between this and if you do not remove your condensate or the polymer , if you wish , then your reaction will end up at oligomer stage , may be dimer , trimer or tetramer .	337.77838085710016

For example in this practical case of penicillin acylase catalyzed hydrolysis of penicillin the kinetic rate expression comes as k2.E0 v = 1 + K ' m / S ( 1 + A / Kia ) + P / Kip ( 1 + K ' m / S ) They have developed the reaction performance equations but the quantitative comparison of CSTR and PFR in such cases will become more and more complex .	191.6117251681953

We are now will talk about next type of additives , which are surface - active agents or surface - active additives now , this additives actual work on different interfaces .	172.1322086214198

You know they are used for very high in the application where you require very high temperature to sustain even kepler has a melting point which is higher than 500 centigrade , sometimes it even burn before it melt .	153.5588311977331

So , the path length between the scatterer and the detectors for this techniques is much longer .	129.04715464827163

So , proper choice of monomer is also very important .	103.85665358973681

Now , how do you determine seniority ?	59.308591213261714

You have to develop an analogy and understand the relationship of the corresponding terms .	85.11455072137626

Among the batch reactors there are mainly two types of configurations that are very commonly used ; one is the stirred tank where you use almost like a tank with the stirring facility .	259.98929769165017

So , in this case , both sides are amine group .	32.11414024417479

Depending upon the further application it may be deionized and other operations may be done , concentrated and you can collect the product and this was the system which was reported for glucoamylase immobilized on DEAE cellulose by ionic binding .	218.48898910990587

So , this is the mechanism by which , halogenated FR along with antimony trioxides synergy works .	176.84202365078085

In this case also there could be other reagents possible , which you , if you add or present are as impurities , it can retard or inhibit the chain polymerization , cationic chain polymerization .	135.92282935361402

These polymers after synthesized are added in some formulations along with the other components like in detergent , paint , ink , emulsions ; where polymers are added with some other compounds .	978.3529423860443

Salting in and salting out both are feasible and of course the phenomena or the physical interactions are just opposite .	843.2481575258819

Besides that the carrier must also have certain properties like porosity that means large surface area so that heavy enzyme loading can be given to the immobilized preparation and we were talking about methods of immobilization .	114.33680280592455

The other desirable feature of the CSTR is that it can be used wherever pH control is required because it provides you an open configuration in which the pH monitoring and control both can be exercised which is very difficult in the case of a plug flow reactor .	50.985636726418164

Now if you look at the experimental value of a viscosity versus molecular weight of a polymer ; viscosity tilled entanglement molecular weight , viscosity increases steadily with a slope of one , but above entanglement molecular weight the polymer chains and the entanglement .	108.03955470627449

In this case all the monomers are same so we name these polymers ; we term these polymers as homo polymers .	92.72461332866561

In this case , these polymers cannot react with each other just by itself .	45.72439433629577

You measure the enzyme activity lets say for example for different particle size in a reactor and the effectiveness factor works out to be more than one .	61.44855166197264

Inhibition by product is a very general feature for all enzyme catalyzed reactions but some enzyme reactions are also inhibited by substrate and this effect because the concentration profile of substrate and product in the two cases of PFR and CSTR are different .	111.86486415337419

Particularly the enzyme which was mixed with the hydrophilic monomer is entrapped within the microcapsule .	123.55010854626957

So , from that value you can exchange , distinguish between , or find out what is the contribution from the surface scattering , and balls scattering on the Haze value .	116.60411968262034

How we can we have learned how to synthesize the polymers .	25.55714913664917

So , we have these three assumptions and which is reasonably fair if we deal with dilute polymer solution .	155.94017734246296

Now as I just mentioned that this light scattering technique can happen for any electromagnetic radiations like visible light or x - ray or neutrons .	164.65380595825246

So , M n would be given by M e multiplied by f where f is the number of end groups per chain .	22.628382762452272

Sometimes , the polymers are named from hypothetical monomers for example , I have this polymer are generally synthesized by hydrolysis of this vinyl , polyvinyl acetate .	154.93057148703218

The presence of even trace of oxygen inhibits polymerization reaction .	502.19069749502637

So if I want to summarize , just plane structure in short of substitutions .	188.4143042147718

Now , we just gave example of this alpha 6 amino caproic acids condensing to 6 amino caproic acid poly caproic acid in last page , this one .	163.15213377916209

In the case of activation energy and optimum temperature I mentioned that different systems have shown different kinds of behavior .	89.95122815154477

That means most of the substrates which is being fed gets converted into product .	57.19534776318505

So all these systems will be considered in the format of immobilized enzyme preparation and the enzyme preparation may be in the coupled form in the insoluble matrix , it could be entrapped into a semi permeable cell or entrapped in the gel because gel also provides you a porous network in which the enzyme can be entrapped and they will not be allowed to pass out through the gel pores because of the size limitation once they are entrapped and a similar thing applies to a ultra filtration reaction .	110.97878974208517

At the end of the cycle of the operation of an immobilized enzyme preparation , if the carrier can be regenerated it is desirable even if its cost is high .	46.708936000673795

And , how these are related ?	71.90589019010334

What did the commercial way of synthesis or the most practiced the synthetic process of making polyester or poly ethylene terephthalicin .	821.1154052927121

We will see in a minute how the surface area is actually important for this catalyst and also it actually help in increase the activity of the polymerization .	64.07110456461022

If there are significant differences in the reactivity of the two diols then there will be a blocky nature in the copolymers .	30.724681614795685

You get a diazonium derivative of the solid support by treating the support containing aromatic amino groups with sodium nitrite .	351.3374000550899

v ’ = 0 This gives you a generalized second order differential equation which can be set for internal pore diffusion cum biochemical reaction .	152.54489221737725

This expression is valid .	34.184931147723

Now , it can abstract this hydrogen and form these dead chain , and you have a new polymer , where you have a radical generated in between not the end .	74.41301815245188

Some cases , we take these natural polymers , and we modify this polymer synthetically for a particular reason , for specific applications .	177.4841461347743

One wants a sparkling clear beer and this clarification or what they call as the term chill proofing is done by immobilized papain , a proteinase enzyme which is immobilized and used in a column because it degrades polypeptides or even polyphenol oxidase also have been used or a mixture of the two so as to degrade those molecules and remove the haze which can be filtered and clarified beer is available .	594.5201103068762

This is something analogous to micelle .	293.96835968911824

Otherwise , if you do not put a bracket it might gives you a confusion of you know which finally , which structure it is .	113.2344306387627

The reactor performance is under steady state which would mean that the rate of reaction and rate of diffusion are same .	47.68373038159767

Now this same polyamide having polyamide having same molecular structure , molecular formula , we can get it from ring - opening polymerization of caprolcatam .	255.8162803955057

The value of this T g is given by the two expressions I just wrote in it .	80.35876791113775

And large fraction actually is greater 95 percent of the fraction of the monomers will be present as large droplets .	100.75151004661241

And , there 2 path ways by which BPA poly carbonate , discriminate polycarbonate undergo photooxidation .	1781.9580295252954

So , we will find that the delays values are more or less independent or every monomer in this chain polymerization .	83.78698593984976

Now , let us imagine what happened inside this particle , you have a polymerization reaction going on at beginning you have a micelle at the beginning you had this micelles , with solon with this monomers one of this R dot or a oligomeric propagating radical gets into this thing , they start polymerization .	147.74580599089143

That means for any given reaction you need a specific enzyme and such specificity has both advantages as well as disadvantages .	153.17565691081637

So , basically , by using additives we can enhance or we can overcome the limited environmental stability of the polymers .	235.62631089538635

So therefore all the intermolecular forces that attribute to the enzyme conformation are altered .	155.30671760097152

And there are some specialized techniques as well , where which are used for specific techniques , special polymerization techniques .	224.17189682977957

Now , we do not have to do ourselves ; now a days fortunately software ’ s are available which can take this and give us this output of this type of output they can give and from which using the formula which we used at the beginning .	135.3378785074426

If one catalyst works on a variety of reactions the life is simple as happens in the case of chemical catalyst .	49.8058329632835

So , as you seen that step polymers happens stepwise .	240.4588833816028

.Now Hazy is cost by both surface scattering , and balls scattering , and you can remove if you want to know what is the contribution from surface and balls scattering , in the Haze , then what can be done .	161.92022901210018

When we measure the effect of enzyme concentration with respect to initial reaction rate or reaction velocity the profile is linear at the small concentration range and then it tapers of in the large enzyme concentration range .	78.8628404634587

That means , this solvents are very poor solvents if you want to build higher molecular weight in the radical polymerization .	53.245640638124264

Where in case of radical polymerization X n varies each time the dead polymer chains are forming .	65.31039149449202

When the 10 percent monomer in the solution the reaction you are doing in a dilute condition the heat management is very good , viscosity is not high , so no gel effect happen .	36.59017733667497

And that is robbery here , leathery state and on further reading , it reaches the viscosity comes down and polymer chains can move fast each other quite easily and that state is robbery .	555.4505728219917

The usual method is that an activated carrier is prepared by steeping it in a solution of transition metal salt for five to ten minutes and mind it that it is important because longer contact of the matrix in the transient salt solution can result in the degradation because the pH of this solution , like titanium tetra chloride , will be very , very low , almost one to two .	141.89327461259793

Again when I say the term high it refers in the comparative form and the comparison here is with covalent binding .	410.6563850103322

Here it is the low energy of activation as a result of catalyst and this indicates the high energy of activation in the absence of any catalyst .	47.149234343301096

So , product might will form much faster rate , if you are not starting the reaction .	152.66504434127427

If you do it at lower temperature , then M e value will come down and reaction will proceed till that equilibrium value of the monomer concentration .	18.502090141873452

So , you should not use that and wet membranes when they are used for the experiment they have to first the solvent has to change gradually so that they are wet .	147.21447529714192

So , a radical a kinetic chain or a propagating radical can undergo three reaction it can again reactive with the monomer and propagate , it can terminate , it can transfer .	114.48892956583903

Enzyme being a protein or rather a foreign protein to the body , the body is equipped with antibodies to generate immunological reactions and they can also be problematic and infact the administration of any enzyme for therapeutic application must overcome these problems .	958.247678332334

On the other side if you take let us say two different substrate concentrations required for two different levels of activity to reach for example say between 0.75 and 0.1 , that is substrate concentration for reaction velocity to reach 0.75 and 0.1 .	85.00807551368

So , when polymer samples is injected in to this column then the solvent takes away or carries this polymer molecules to the detector and this pores which are in the column are responsible for the separation it brings about .	254.65495037186093

As a rule of thumb it is still valid today .	66.72852175308628

So , if you can find out theoretically , what will be the extent of reflection , then we can find out , what will be maximum transparency , of any material or a plastic material , and that is theoretically given by fractional equation .	79.99821275636074

Now , how do we get this , to get this we found the average life time we defined average life time of a radical at steady state at steady state tau s is the concentration of total radical species as steady state by the rate of termination square or 1 by 2 k t .	87.13957248866254

Now , that is achieved by reversible termination or reversible transfer reaction , say I have an initiator molecule which is R z .	111.98185829673659

And as is , as we discussed , that external catalyst is always preferred than an internal catalyst , that basically with internal catalyst , outside catalyst , it is very difficult , even more difficult to high molecular , so external catalyst is always preferred .	238.25379103708215

They bind in different ways .	79.13002294482496

Stable refers to that the enzyme , the amino acylase from aspergillus species was isolated and one of the first enzyme which was isolated was based on methionine acylase .	209.776321329934

So , when you define degree of polymerization it is the number of structural units not the number of repeat units present in a polymer .	24.66898649515961

Also even as an analytical tool you can use when we want to determine many of the metabolite concentrations using enzymes , the basis of the design of experiment is kinetic parameters .	171.52307227255224

So , in case of cationic , r 1 is 10.5 and r 2 is 0.1 .	32.39094846700515

In fact the basic role is played by the unfavorable interactions present in the active site .	28.95732930392342

And we also introduced the term kinetic chain length how it is related to the average number number average degrees of polymerization .	18.376035855432956

This is z average molecular weight , but most commonly this two terms are used and those are sufficient for your description of your sample and to quantify the breadth of the distribution this term is used poly dispersive index or simply sometimes dispersive index which is given by this ratio .	152.771981463396

Though they are very , they are brittle .	344.949032741232

As expected in the case of soluble enzyme there is no recovery of enzymes and the cost of the enzyme in the case of immobilized process is very , very small almost negligible compared to this .	43.344728569426074

E * is energy of activation .	31.710736087543893

But if you think , to increase the temperature at some temperature the rate of depolymerization will also be insignificant , in those cases we have to consider the rate of depolymerization also .	48.89000312176134

In this case if you poly A , and a block poly B , then you can actually used these copolymer , block copolymer as a comfortabalizer , between poly A and poly B , and by doing this you can actually improve the property of the blend , of poly A and poly B .	44.837952414688765

Let us assume that the reaction follows the type of mechanism as indicated here k1 k2 k3 E + S ES ET E + P k - 1 k - 2 k - 3 It is a totally reversible reaction and you have the rate constant k1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 , k - 3 .	23.484440427033395

The substitution could be aldehyde group , or a say ketone , or a acid , or ester , or amine , amide , like this , so it could be any of this groups .	116.33192585136288

So , you can expect a linear relationship .	42.3529215994463

Thus , we have just seen from the freely rotating bond .	109.97375327644305

For example when we say general description I am talking of the reaction scheme that is the reaction which you are looking at catalyzing ; then the source of enzyme - which enzyme and from what source has been used ; carrier .	126.60445806545029

You get an activated matrix and the activated matrix then can react with the amino group of enzyme and give you the enzyme bound to it and the ammonia can be released .	38.18823261374001

So , we need to do calibration and then we need to do the normalization of the detector signals .	113.22575533672781

They are based on platinum cathode and a silver anode which is immersed in saturated KCl which is separated from the test solution by a PTFE membrane .	247.30887477123898

Now , one thing you might have noticed that for 100 percent bulk whether 80 or 60 percent it as reached a 100 percent conversion of the monomer where for the bulk polymerization 100 percent of the monomer as not reacted and make polymers , it as not polymerized 100 percent .	236.81176919923817

But in the case of a reaction that undergoes product inhibition the performance still becomes more superior .	126.80855034620855

So , we will , even without pushing the reaction to very high conversion we can make high molecular weight in this case .	58.912012811064834

So , if you write just polymer chain conformation like this and in and in real polymer , these are basically different chains are entangled with each other .	81.65939096691206

And if you are doing in a solution , you are doing this poly step polymerization reaction solution , then you can also try and change the solvent .	43.585102927681156

The most significant part is that they regulate the various functions of the cell in such an accurate manner probably no other control system in any chemical process plant can think of .	239.6605137263673

Now , what is the value of E R ?	7.599365120652178

So , it is , how can you write in simple term ?	120.61728522608644

At the very beginning itself , the polymers , large polymer chains are forming and as time goes , the conversion happens .	75.2116709893627

So , how can we achieve that ?	21.747488433790352

The what are the preferred conditions you know it should be external catalyzed it should be open driven system where you your systems should have ability to take out the small molecular byproduct as much as possible from the system .	132.74087329933934

So , from third to last will be z minus 1 because one is already blocked ; one of the neighbors is already blocked .	124.18405887833832

Ks One can develop the expression to write the differential and equate it to zero and that will end up in the substrate concentration for the maximum reaction velocity that is the maxima .	71.45352198460367

Styrene has been assigned so arbitrarily a value of Q is 1 and e is 1.0 and 0.8 .	225.6661156711462

So , if you start or anytime during your reaction , if your free monomer concentration is higher than the equilibrium monomer concentration corresponding to tact temperature , your reaction temperature , then what will happen ?	50.866094087610165

So , basically this is considered a perfectly reflecting material .	202.1712254950355

And if it is for absolutely clear application , then there should not be any haze or any yellowness in the material and so on .	129.92428094743283

So , the cost for the particular application must be kept in someone , in mind of the , in mind of the manufactural .	207.34932380803622

Now , one thing also we should remember in case of step polymerization , that the chains , when the chains are forming during the reactions , the chains can , there is a possibility , that chains can also undergo exchange reaction between them and making the chains reacting with each other .	69.79469578007165

Their retention in the entrapped method is far superior compared to the soluble enzyme .	149.72249165128417

So , average number of initiator residues for polymer chain is given by , n n a by 2 plus ( 1 minus a ) n 2 by 2 by a , this is we term as b .	48.725164464510904

That means the molecular weight is more compared to the molecular weights which were getting generated before .	49.319056703656194

With small pull , they stretch out longer time .	2330.1272131687283

You cannot use halogenated solvents , which were suitable for cationic polymerization because they are fissile reactions with the carbon ions and other polar solvents like alcohols or ketones , esters also cannot be used , as well as , H 2 O cannot be used because the same reason of cationic , because they can very quickly react with the carboionic propagating species and terminate the chain reaction .	235.76927797612456

So , with temperature a polymer material can show different types of visco elasticity behavior from a perfect elastic to a perfect viscous behavior , within behavior of visco elasticity .	103.02314028638807

And when they are added this nano - fillers are added to the polymer formulation , the resulting formulation or resulting polymers are called nanocomposites .	136.48374348857774

One of them oxidizes AH and produces A , where as the other one reduces B using the same co - factor in the reverse direction .	373.3916499487684

Each initiator molecule produces , if we consider a thermally initiated polymerization , each I produce 2 R dot .	675.6493515170042

Or we can if it is not a homo polymer , it is a blend of different phase , there is a basically there could be two , one a soft or rubbery phase and a hard or elastic phase .	120.01995509346087

So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation .	124.90579524460382

If this instauration is at the end of the polyester , which you formed then these are known as alkyd polyesters , how do you do that , the same reaction like in this case phthalic an hydride glycerol there you are hiding one mono functional acids , which has a alkene group a double bond at the other end .	224.60611604932927

We must ensure that we are measuring our enzyme concentration in the linear range that means at low enzyme concentration level .	72.15242508188008

Until 2000 , more than ninety five percent of the Ziegler - Natta polymerization used combination of this sort of catalyst before the discovery of the metallization catalyst .	271.75834546827076

The yeast cells when they are permeabilized , the lipid on the membrane is dissolved by a solvent and it becomes freely permeable to various substrates .	682.5428593599697

When substrate concentration becomes very high the enzyme molecule might bind to two substrate molecules , one of the carboxylic groups from each of the succinic acids .	81.5844388930795

That is one of the major advantage but the major disadvantage or drawback from the industrial application point of view is that the specificity requires a single enzyme to be produced for each reaction , as the engineer will appreciate that the benefits of scale of operation for the enzyme production is lost .	118.8579062172546

There is lot of variation in terms of their characteristic features required as a specific catalyst .	87.97406342631871

And in today ’ s lecture , we are going to start our discussion on polymer properties and how they are evaluated , this properties are evaluated .	12.877658671686099

There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially .	382.82613213840784

So if you want show this in peterocially , if you are two face system immiscibly system you get corresponding , two T g corresponding to the homo polymers , and if you have completely mixed or miscible blend , miscible copolymers , then you have T g intermediate between these two .	282.5383348529001

In most methods we take either a prefabricated carrier or a carrier for conditioning either activation or some conditioning and couple that to the enzyme with a physico - chemical interaction .	652.6750272148822

In the lab the testing which is done is , call limiting oxygen index , it is most versatile small scale test .	510.988415722021

So , how many molecules will be unreacted left over ?	93.14637496400177

Now in case instead of diol if you use hexanediamine and use that adipic acid , we will get poly hexamethylene adipamide .	347.9691849603989

So , you have to at the end of the polymerization you have to take out the poly carbonate by steam precipitation if you steam precipitation .	61.65232377258085

The energy required to reach the transition state is already reduced .	55.300844424264525

Most cases this M 1 and M 2 m will have difference in reactivity , and results what happened one of the monomers get incorporated in the growing copolymer , much faster rate compared to the other .	94.7611522113862

And then we said that if we plot this expression .	17.91756846813532

One example , there are many , many additives can be used ; one additives , one type of additives are shown here .	79.1661908213141

This loss of enzyme activity could be real or could be apparent .	116.80414596278207

For a photo chemical initiation or photo initiation , R i is twice fie I a ; I a is the intensity of the radiation , and fie is the quantum yield for initiation is similar to efficiency f for thermal initiation , this fie is the quantum yield for initiation .	262.10762336225326

In the first slide we saw that some of the enzymes which are of industrial value are very specific .	46.556118774951074

Average would remain same , 25 years .	2442.282556762512

As a matter of fact that you need catalyst to accelerate the reaction , but you do not need in true sense , you do not need an external initiator like in the case of chain polymers .	28.39190345201386

And this D z is equal to this quantity where K is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature , f 0 is we can get from stokes equation , 6 pie eta 0 R h where R h is the hydrodynamic volume ; perform this we can get if we know eta 0 and the temperature , and value of this from this dynamic light scattering correlation .	239.95688509204098

So , what I am trying ; with this example , what I am trying to convince you that , may be the average remain same in two cases ; in the first case , there was 25 years 20 50 students , and in this case , you have replaced 4 student with 4 another set of person .	93.60500226226348

You can actually afford to have some degree of this impurities in cases of radical chain polymerization and that is why this radical chain polymerization are utilized in industry , the large set up , much more frequently than ionic chain polymerization .	85.14458765748

So , what are the other observation we can make here , say at for a conversion of p ?	101.73444609048457

If you replace this one with if you interchange this molecule with this molecule , you are getting the same arrangement .	234.7601961853157

For example , for generic expression we are using , it can be , it can be shown here and the examples of isopropylene polymerization will be in water , you can write a termination reaction like this .	73.02797152921457

So , theta is T by psi .	463.764265062861

So , you have to carry out reaction the temperature below above glass transition temperature and you the glass transition temperature come down with more and more monomer present in the system of the polymerization medium .	39.17170618597182

High specific activity means the catalytic power of the enzyme is much high .	182.3914035758948

The fluids have very strong conditions for example the fluid in the stomach will have a very low pH .	203.31862412105113

There are two R ’ s – R and R ’ are the alkyl residues .	180.35136923120987

It is increased by a factor 1 + I / Ki .	35.7013490308666

We are giving the definition of yield that means the total amount of activity , which is resulting in the immobilized preparation is reasonably high , almost in the range of say about 70 to 90 % enzyme activity is recovered in immobilized preparation and because the conditions are mild they don ’ t tend to cause conformational change so that is a very plus point as compared to other methods in which yields will be much lower .	114.36736631703288

Then , what happens is this equilibrium is shifted mainly towards this sight .	239.53389090584986

So , what is the equilibrium constant ?	8.808107390273635

In the case of allosteric enzymes we have a simplified rate equation which can express or which can describe the rate behavior of the allosteric enzymes .	48.86417998861424

Similarly here this imino carbonic acid complex instead of reacting with the enzyme molecule can react with hexamethylene diamine which provides you free amino groups and the hexamethylene diamine will attach here or instead of giving an immobilized enzyme , you will be getting - CHOH–CH - O - CONH - ( CH2 ) 6–NH2 .	190.54380329795063

These are mostly oligomers which can be polymerized using UV light .	61.45089705449525

It can act as a batch immobilized enzyme reactor where with the total recycle packed bag , the total recycle mode .	116.58684094215873

during continuous use .	1455.6932043327804

And if there a optical homogeneities just beneath the surface ; obviously , the amount of light scattered , reflected will be different , and the gloss will come down .	304.96971756382334

And as I said repeatedly in case of step polymers you get the high molecular weight only at high conversion where in case of chain polymers you can get high molecular weight even at low conversion , with time or with conversion only the number of high molecular weight chains or the amount of high molecular chain increases .	36.3415201351498

If you take or increase the polarity of the medium , if you compare these two the temperature is almost closed .	32.78244559639281

But there are some polar monomers , like methyl methaculate or methyl vinyl ketone , which can undergo side reaction , which actually restrict the molecular build up .	37.88541838707604

So if we require a definite property , or a property if you are looking for , for particular application then if that property is not available in a single homopolymer , then you can , from a prior knowledge of the properties of the homopolymers , you can actually synthesis copolymer of required proportion to get that property you want .	152.1210521500141

That means the free enzyme molecule will be inactive or has a very low activity .	57.8698747161976

How do you write them in terms of nomenclature , if you make say copolymer with styrene and acylonitrile .	122.44019180462865

They are retained in the reactor system .	10.86143685245743

Such a process therefore leads to a very efficient catalytic system .	115.51375939621207

The increase in the quantity of the enzyme required is not very large in the low fractional conversion levels whereas as soon as you cross 0.90 % conversion , the quantity required becomes significantly high .	95.81130446123139

We discussed the various types of chain transfer reactions possible in radical polymerization , and their effect ; effect on molecular weight in principle , that modes are chain , more chain transfer happen , molecular weight actually gets reduced compared to if there was no chain transfer reaction .	72.40853431348056

They are packed bed systems and achieving a perfect plug flow condition may not be feasible in large scale reactors while in the case of small scale reactors by manipulating or by increasing the length to diameter ratio one can achieve a much better plug flow behavior .	121.2923507296359

It could also interfere with the binding due to steric hindrances in such a way that the binding of substrate is prevented fully or partially and substrate and the inhibitor are mutually exclusive .	110.95738981200633

The same applies to agarose which is also a polysaccharide and also can be converted into a gel by cooling and there are some other polymers including synthetic polymers which have been used by this mode into immobilized preparation .	136.9295660170878

Let us talk about the effect of backbone stiffness ; backbone of the polymer chain .	22.17721358616133

So rate of mass transfer is klam .	53.31985849930881

? l / P This means Kappm increases by a magnitude of ?	172.04097636015095

So it is always given these and this choice , because the presence of this stabilizing group y as a substituent .	158.5887608670542

Similarly in the case of ES it will be k2.k - 2 .	22.983592221801757

So , the more the transfer reaction , obviously , the average degrees of polymerization comes down so as same , same discussion you can have what we had for the reaction , chain radical polymerization .	61.68208220119517

P is a probability that a propagating radical will continue to propagate that means continue to react with monomer .	51.35629397772285

Remember , the rate expression for redox reaction , it was k p M k d concentration of reductant twice k t to the power half and X n bar could give you k p to the power M k p m twice over b twice k t k d red ox to the power half .	90.98948272926495

I just taken out 2 student , added 2 , 10 years ; and , taken out another 2 student of 25 years , added 40 years .	1244.1768430787488

Homopolymer can have polymers made from two different monomers , say A and B as said in earlier classes , earlier class .	122.61533467959073

Substituting the value of ES from equilibrium analysis you can come down to a initial reaction rate vo = k2 [ E - S ] If you look at the original mechanistic hypothesis proposed by Michaelis and Menten , you can write k2 P + E .	73.83613905268797

When I say absolute specificity I mean that the enzyme can recognize only one substrate .	67.7532643149838

Secondly how enzyme under the same background is able to provide much larger reduction in activation energy and provide a more efficient catalyst compared to chemical catalyst .	77.81416450167372

So , how many number ; this is number of cells already occupied by the polymer segments .	39.8657642343656

This distinction between the two will be more clarified or clear when we proceed ahead but such a situation exists in the case of bi - substrate reactions .	217.3654639546975

But , this reactions we know this direct esterification of alcohol and acids or say ester an acid groups are very slow reactions .	349.4733989629421

This method is not very capable of measuring the number average molecular weight for very high molecular weight .	49.53004670041858

You can do it in a disperse dispersed resulting polymer the produced polymer could be dispersed in organic solvent and you can continue the polymerization as the polymers remain in disperse .	189.20590007500763

dx = ?	1603.8523653670181

And it is the sample , and then you can detect the transmission transmitted light of the emitted light using detectors , and then you get the information about the sample from absorption spectra , emission spectra or a scattering like Raman scattering .	204.93267486414607

We also know how p is related to time .	93.47463662278045

So , that is the assumption we are making and we are telling that is mean - field approximation where we are considering that all the segments which are already present in the 3D lattice are distributed randomly ; they are not joined , they are distributed randomly .	56.5715604738895

But if they are very tightly bound , then they can coordinate .	69.88530636539356

This plus… Basically , this , as I said , it can propagate from both the sides .	84.9131938081367

After the gel is formed then you can subject it to butyraldehyde to provide crosslinking and therefore get a permanently insoluble gel preparation .	275.3248013009539

Now what we will do in the next lecture ; we will discuss the strategy how we can and how those ionic polymerization can or would give the isotactic polymerization .	42.85988476259897

In all these cases by following a typical pattern that is by understanding the reaction mechanism , the binding of the inhibitor and substrate to the enzyme and their interaction between each other one can really arrive at a rate expression .	49.50361515175

There are no similarities except that there will be some homologies of the sequence of different amino acids in same nature of functional enzymes .	157.07601278833758

So , if if only transfer possible to monomer , then you can write X n bar is plus C M .	78.86582941202343

Similarly in the case of most of the kinases , hexokinase , a typical example of the very first reaction in glycolysis , magnesium ions are absolutely required .	146.4946702966493

For in practice , most of the industrial polymers at the end of the polymers , if you measure the molecular weight distribution , you find , no it is found that PDI is slightly more than 2 , not much say , 2.2 , 2.5 , something like that .	62.36448916058644

It is reversible inhibition which forms the major portion of the effector molecules that are of industrial , medical or biological value in the case of understanding the scientific basis of enzymatic catalysis .	174.97737415174046

This is something like an extension to that and which means that when the substrate molecule binds on one of the binding sites of the enzyme it immediately triggers off a conformational change whereby the affinity for the next binding site becomes much higher and they expressed it with an interaction factor .	112.22833692536354

And then if we find further this values of Q 1 , Q and e for the other monomers by taking copolymers between them .	104.17146066287499

Km / S0 will be large and under that condition you must assume a first order kinetics and if the value of Km / S0 decreases the error will continue to increase .	50.40673627669986

There is no significant heat of reaction , isothermal operation .	105.99306283801359

There are ample literatures available from which one can write for pore diffusion control first order reactions , assuming spherical particles in the packed bed reactor the effectiveness factor is given as 1 / f = [ 1 / f ( 1 / tan3f - 1 / 3f ) ] That is the relationship between f and effectiveness factor and using this effectiveness factor then you can write down the reaction rate expression for first order kinetics .	121.93595641301931

Therefore when you are going to loose almost fifty percent amino acid , in recovery process the cost is going to be double plus the cost involved in the purification itself .	284.2590422924638

We have considered the reactions that follow Michaelis Menten kinetics , the reactions that follows substrate inhibition or product inhibition ; we also considered approximation with respect to zero order and first order reaction regimes in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	80.55544784866302

So in that case the other alternative is that it should be feasible that other interfering enzyme if there are any it should be possible to inactivate them by some pretreatment which does not influence the desired enzyme .	96.4856457025558

This is one arrangement and you can have same here , and now this is a arrangement which is alternating here , and this is two carbon have alternating stereochemistry , so this is a tryad , this is a t over tryad , and their arrangement is r r , racemic .	298.40812701764366

Input and output here are taken as zero because there is no continuous input and output .	339.15853914147743

At T 2 , you have again , this is the binodal points and these are two are the spinodal points .	44.573566896618324

So , if it is a polyester , you have to name as a polyester like polyethylene terephthalate , if it is a amide you have to name as a amide .	28.61129266572804

Total number of functional group reacted divided by total number of functional group present .	7.072248474420577

So finally , delta R s by C at C is equal to 0 will give you the K R s which is this K for the resistance by M n .	116.8276919497873

In such a case you will ultimately end up with the kinetic equation or kinetic expression which will express the sigmoidal reaction velocity profile response .	156.27499094751727

Even if you are producing an radical which is as good as death death chain , because it is not talking part in initiation of a mu chain .	187.23749297435214

This has been one of the attributes in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation where many times we require a particular operational pH for certain other conditions .	106.30102938263902

Now , this is the chain polymerization that is interesting because the polymers you are making .	33.34706716095991

In in a basically , very same manner how this equipments are done , light sources there is a light source , and there is a frequency selector , which basically select a single frequency or you can have the entire light in that particular region of interest pass through this .	443.0622996725343

This course as you know , deals with one of the largest group of biomolecules what we know as enzymes .	208.69617647639805

This concentration is in the bulk .	46.15885005909512

The effectiveness factor can be made to go towards one but in these cases you face other operational problems like at the low particle size there is a risk of high pressure drop across the bed resulting in more power consumption for operating the enzyme reactor .	202.32824048934566

In the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics if we put the v ’ term which is a non - linear expression the analytical solutions are difficult and usually you approach numerical solutions which have been also reported in literature .	83.27400823141184

If you remember or recollect from your memory in case of chain polymerization if you stop the reaction in between say after small amount of monomers got reacted , you will find that you have high molecular weight polymer as well as lots of monomers depending upon which stage you have stopped the reaction and also initiator molecules .	44.24018813371817

So , we get highly coiled chains .	140.10596536343442

These arrows represent this and this .	494.9099479149331

So , let us write this .	12.822649765856648

This is the volume of this particle .	30.999187788121485

Now , how a , if you have a monomer like this , C H 2 , again come back to that very simple monomer .	46.41076688887443

If you change the fractional conversion to , let us say , 0.99 , the Erel value shoots up to 25 .	82.94829888862901

For example , if you have say during a polyester formation , if you have something like this , there is one more very common side reaction is happens is by beta elimination reaction .	84.68516495032173

So , we can , for large x , we can remove or discard this term , ignore this term .	130.04474091290976

So far we have been limited in our mind regarding the application of enzymes that they can work only in aqueous environment .	79.4558040259863

Now , again if I plot , so that is the line corresponds to F 1 is f 1 which happens when r 1 is equals to r 2 is equal to 1 .	53.8948837686622

Similar applications will come here for biology also .	614.5939952984568

Nanowires or nanofibers , where it is basically whiskers or filaments with diameters in the range of 100 to 10 to 100 nanometer , having high aspect ratio .	1641.7243484762207

So , your polymer chain increases linearly and in this case it has , if it has to happen , it has to , the reactions which responsible for the chain termination of , by terminating the reactive in groups has to be absent in this case so that polymer can , polymer chain can increase linearly .	111.71841745699153

Similarly a number of ion selective electrodes which also function in the same principle of potentiometric transducer can be used as transducing element .	249.0125170590464

Most of the chemically catalyzed reaction or chemical reactions represent a particular order of reaction , zero order , first order or second order .	131.03289340521349

In those cases the binding of the substrate to the enzyme will depend upon the ionization state of the substrate .	11.082144310221086

Now , from our thermo dynamical knowledge we can simply write the delta G 0 p p is for pore penetration is given by RT l n this equilibrium constant and del G can be written as del H 0 p p enthalpy and T delta S 0 p p .	62.69063730014905

Within fraction of a minute they simplify the situation of a cardiac failure problem due to blood clot .	1035.3757128488378

Therefore both have the same relationship as far as the fractional conversion is concerned .	57.654689575327225

Rest of the enzyme concentration will not be useful .	49.286299772946585

So , the PDI goes beyond 2 .	169.860899194413

Tensile strains for bulk bulk polymers are less than about 100 MPa whereas , metals and ions , they are quiet high .	2047.8031216367376

So , when you talk about you know , but in commonly , in common man whatever they see is applications of polymers , they see in daily life is a plastic , you know applications are visible as a plastics application .	406.91734123565476

In the case of F curve , the C0 is the maximum concentration and that concentration is reached instantaneously .	93.89222376123081

And as the reaction is very fast and complex , this kinetic data , kinetic data are often , often not reproducible because this kinetic data is not always reproducible , especially in this case of kinetics , especially in case of cationic polymerization , cationic , the mechanism and the mechanism on kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially cationic chain polymerization is still not completely understood , to understand the mechanism in kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially the cationic one , because as I said , these reactions are very fast and not reproducible .	130.0267537197354

They are used to determine r 1 and 2 .	62.86345468605566

They only say that after all these interactions have taken place some of the reaction mechanism responsible for catalytic function will take place and the reaction is catalyzed .	83.13066393296037

S / K ’ m + S The role of an activator works out to modify the intrinsic Km value of an enzyme and the effect on the Km value will influence the rate of the reaction .	35.5083321947948

So , hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case ; hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case .	55.561490417936476

I am just writing the Kappa values right on the arrow so that while writing the rate expression it will be easier .	121.66390978904096

So the typical range of bond energy , which are used for a initiator , to be applicable has a thermal initiator is , around 100 to 170 kilo joule per mol .	47.992000731956395

The method was proposed by King and Altmen way back in 1956 .	55.707205492211266

It ’ s only convenient .	294.5275974078646

At the end , if there are excess M 2 , you get free monomers .	143.48515062122902

This is reaction monomer with the initiator molecule itself .	57.94117455419178

If you rearrange you get ( ds / dx ) out - ( ds / dx ) in 2 - .v ’ = 0 dx RD If you take limit dx tends to zero you can write simply as the second order differential equation d2s / dx2 – 2 / DR .	300.6491513431902

They are also used for thermal insulations .	170.1888556225163

And chain dimension the expansion factor will be more than 1 , so real chain end - to - end , RMS end - to - end distance will be higher than the RMS end - to - end distance for unperturbed chain .	21.887142114120028

Now , it was first started around mid - 1950s mid 1950s where first Ziegler , Scientist in Germany , he was doing ethylene polymerization ; So , ethylene and in pressure Trialkyl aluminum .	4479.699338880618

This delta T is the temperature difference from the final to initial .	217.8173186169068

If you consider a glucose isomerase it is a xylose isomerase .	143.83334396943695

So , with this we stop for this lecture , and we will start the next topic in next lecture .	6.83881350913891

And if the polymers are soft then they will stick to each other .	39.69482761803987

Now , if you want to do a reaction , and you should have prior knowledge about the initiator molecule , prior knowledge about their t half value , or the time it takes to become half .Then you can choose your reaction temperature , or if you want to do your reactions some particular temperature , or a range of temperature , then you can choose the proper initiator for your reaction .	50.90112036434428

So , ionic chain polymerization we will consider only when both the initiation and the propagation reaction is by ionic species .	67.63635332601524

So , an ideal solution formation leads to a thermal mixing with no change in enthalpy of the system .	132.4557805593758

It is coming from the expression we used in the last page .	26.49186667106744

How do you induce crystallinity in the material ?	15.461035856098462

So , polymer is one of the components among many .	150.8426455264494

We will discuss we will basically continue our discussion having polymers in solution and the topics , we plan to cover today this lecture is now cohesive energy density and solubility parameter .	73.62020903503823

In this case , exactly is 98 percent , but for all purpose , we can consider P is 1 and PDI is close to 2 and MD is close to 20000 .	179.49725864777258

So , P e m 0 , so in case of that rearranging , we get P e as root k 1 plus root k or x n bar is 1 by 1 over P e .	242.8312975510287

There are arrangements for temperature , pH and flow rate control .	441.20831862023385

If suppose there is no reaction taking place then along the length of the reactor at Z the substrate concentration will reach to Sb same as in bulk .	70.20800975352005

And next lecture onwards I will start the chain polymers and chain polymerization with starting with radical chain polymerization .	33.75654675999629

So , let us stop for this lecture , and I will start the discussion of polymer additive in the next lecture .	14.928324971832964

So , what are the characterize , for the characteristic for the interfacial polymerization we just discussed one that polymerization occurs the interfacial of two liquids and each of the liquid phase contains one reactant .	368.96152292375064

The famous Jacob - Monod model , the Lac - Operon model was the one earliest study as far as the regulation of proteins are concerned and induction is a very common tool for regulation of the enzyme synthesis .	433.9320653553025

This can react with this self form non radical specious and this can form with other M n dot and can form a non radical specious .	73.8495250670064

So , as P is 1 , if you have some molecular weight in target , you can use this formula and you can complete the reaction in such a way , now r is the ratio of the functional group of the two bi - functional monomers .	37.92986733264326

So , we know value of R I we also can find out the value of I .	29.1461953018865

Number of ways you can arrange is 1 because no matter how many times you interchange the molecules you will always end up in same arrangement .	109.76336933469443

So , you are now convinced or you understand this understood this concept .	265.3105284551109

Otherwise it was difficult earlier because if the substrate is coming in the solution form in an organic solvent you need to remove the organic solvent put into water medium and then carry out the reaction which is practically not feasible but which can be made feasible if you use the advanced enzymes in the organic medium .	83.73336630906134

Collagen and gelatin are proteins whereas agarose is a polysaccharide .	1018.8971442006199

There are large variety of covalent bond formation methods available in literature .	44.318396474571614

Similarly , this line is the loci for locus for the spinodal points , spinodal points these are the different points for the different temperature .	159.7985184853813

Similarly , if the entropy denies term , can be reduced , then the T g goes up .	63.719404501782954

For adsorption we follow a number of methods .	240.27175735743342

Now , at higher temperature , if we increase T temperature , then this second term , T del S , becomes higher and higher .	126.09569907068177

They also have produced commercially and find several applications and some other monomers which are also used or polymerized by radical chain .	111.31930972120406

If you have no substitution , its work fine in radical , if you have monosubstituted , it works fine , except the case where it is C H 3 propylene , will come back of why it is so .	413.4824712149134

These are the standard kind of inhibition patterns which we are familiar with ; substrate inhibition or a product inhibition which is non competitive or competitive .	45.81991345811425

Turn over number may work out to be a lump parameter consisting of more than one rate constant .	83.89953642500687

The substrate concentration goes down and the reaction rate varies in the PFR along the length of the reactor .	27.373365852658235

In the last lecture we were discussing about the various ways of classifying polymers and at the end we came at the most important ways to , you know important way to classify polymer is based on its structure and the mechanism by which it is typically polymerized with , on the base of structure we , it was said that you can divide polymerization , polymers in addition and condensation in two ways .	70.92041645628416

Thatís why Iím saying first and third are similar but the enzyme transfers phosporyl group on to the third carbon atom .	122.908877186633

Now , for all practical purposes , as I said that , this are equilibrium reaction ; this condensed are taken out from the reaction by applying high vacuum and high temperature .	29.899417857810917

However , if you remember , that the in case of temperature effect of photo chemical reaction , which is little more complicated because the initiators , which produces radical photo chemically , they also produce radical at a higher temperature .	149.8040959897744

For example , when a patient goes through a open heart surgery , the blood of the patient ’ s body is taken out and by help of external machine called oxygenator , which act basically as lungs and heart .	601.776838214167

Sometime the information required is only to understand the optimum pH value of the reaction .	91.23468440446669

A student should know are expected to know the molecular distribution and polydispersity index in a step polymerization and we should also know that the for any high molecular step polymer the PDI should be close to 2 or as a matter of close to 2 .	100.15774016817451

For example take again the example of glucose isomerisation .	93.78852416577485

These two different situations will give you an idea , that in some cases and these are very important cases and have lot of physiological importance for the cell to have design such a enzyme which deviate from hyperbolic kinetics as we will see further .	159.88079224806282

Now , if you want to convert elution time to elution volume , there should be the pump , which are getting used in the GPC equipment should be pulse free and it should be able to maintain a steady flow typically around 1 ml per minute .	122.17324458789079

This chi is a temperature dependent dimensionless quantity , which is just defined like this to remove all the information from the lattice .	423.6474638831384

So , root if this is one is s , again the root mean square distance of the elements of the chain from the center of gravity or center of mass of the coil is called the radius of gyration .	43.907553188805785

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and this eighteenth lecture , we will continue our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .	6.585954491264772

Now , when you add the monomers a very small fraction of monomer would be soluble in the aqueous medium , there will be small fraction of the monomer inside the micelle core as a soluble .	38.4411916712353

This is the important mechanism .	64.40739165894801

Now , this is known as Flory - Huggins equation as you might have known by now .	39.36198596300597

So , eventually , the concentration of M 1 in the reaction , M 1 monomer in the reaction will come down to 0 .	45.420782174685584

Because we were having the discussion on Mark - Houwink equation , let us start the method or the techniques which uses dilute solution viscometry .	100.41102368364349

Similarly the ks is the Michaelis Menton constant corresponding to substrate s and p corresponds to the product when you start the reaction .	329.5876861968381

Now , as we just said , that E P is less than E t , most cases , most general cases , so this is negative , which means , that X n 0 goes up with decrease in temperature .	60.67512792488471

Therefore it often gives problem in determining the various reaction parameters particularly the Vm and the km values .	266.6425700751837

I write VA .	1191.254370904404

So , weight fraction is given by this number , this expression whereas , number of fraction was given by this was N 0 here how a plot will look like if a plot here .	150.35040526734966

So , they are thermodynamically miscible , immiscible polymers blends were the individual polymers components are phase separated .	952.9426235147214

So , that you can make a high molecular weight and reaction get faster and you get the final formed final polymer in terms of a sheet .	45.86872237827278

So , how do you name this one ?	12.098374940714328

The enzyme is in structure confirmationally which is very much complimentary to the transition state of the substrates and by binding that it stabilizes those transition complex .	184.63093401613006

Now this three thousand , just to understand and bring it into a systematic feature , have been classified into six different classes .	249.56384720636947

That means energy content per molecule and the number of molecules in a system will have a Gaussian distribution and only those molecules that possess sufficient energy which are showed here by a shaded portion , only that fraction of molecules will undergo chemical transformation .	209.12914722252037

So , now I move to a a new topic nomenclature .	111.721275049537

In this case , the same thing you can generate the z dot which is very stable like nitroxide triazolinyl trityl radical .	170.7141280283041

It could be a covalent bond , it could be some non - covalent interactions and those methods fall under carrier binding methods .	41.4340279950831

Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion .	78.34294695026624

The difference between the two parameters is k2 / k1and two parameters will become identical if we assume that the k2 is much , much less than k - 1 , if the k2 is assumed to be very , very small rate constant compared to k - 1 .	51.79288204688278

And also we need to very careful about that we have to run as many as can in the NMR as possible , this spectra more quantitative the lesser , the number of scam the error the more will be error in the in the composition .	232.38694847692653

And again it is a , as we can remember the discussion for radical polymerization , we can write if there is bimolecular reaction between a monomer and a carbanionic chain end .	79.121928591574

And , they finally , they can form this , which is responsible for the yellowing of the polymer material .	74.67338110487525

If you look at the energy content of the molecules it will show you a Gaussian distribution .	40.811301379999534

So , typically this will act as an isotropic scatterer and signals which we can normalize with a particular signal which is placed at 90 degree for an aqua solvent .	165.44630365850023

So , what happen slowly this micelle core will become something like this is larger , so after some time you have this is say polymer particle , and this concern polymer particle and free monomer , and your surfactant micelle grows in size .	207.87375889854007

We measure it in terms of half life and the various reasons which cause the loss of stability during operation are enzyme denaturation , the thermal deactivation of the enzyme , adsorption of the inhibitory substances because the feed stream might include certain toxic substances which might inhibit the enzyme activity .	401.77228250458734

In the relationship Kd.t , t is the time of reactor operation .	172.0390063765781

So , this is done with a fix shape , this tensile test is done with a fix shape , size and environment to condition and elongation at at a chosen or specified rate d L by dt .	406.78023850910205

Now , what happen to k c and k p ?	17.814235628965246

We are carrying out reaction in CSTR and when the reaction goes on , the product formed is sent out as the permeate in the ultra filtration cell and the enzyme and the polymer bound coenzyme is retained in the reactor and the substrate can be fed continuously by pressure gradient in the reactor vessel and the reactor can be continued over a long period of time .	50.691817243139766

So , what we will do in the next lecture we will start discussing about the other methods of determining molecular weight namely M n and M w and other polymer solvent interaction parameters .	13.271728917156869

That means the volume of the reactor occupied by the enzyme preparation is negligible compared to the total reactor volume whereas in the case of a packed bed a significant proportion of the reactor is occupied by the enzyme preparation .	18.614470057525107

Now , you know for organic chemistry knowledge , what is the stability of differing , what is the strain ?	89.8080711945303

So , unless there is a specific mechanism in normal case , there will always be syndiotactic would be a preferred tacticity .	81.39988468949609

And for large expansion it can also shown that , it is a approximately proportional to n to the power 1 over 10 , n is the number of bonds , so basically this expansion factor is approximately proportional to the molecular weight to the power 1 by 10 , where n is proportional to molecular , the molecular proportion to n , so for large expansion we will use this in future .	48.39463281948502

The solubility is enhanced by the formation of weak ionic interactions and the hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water and the protein molecule has a large number of charged amino acids which can contribute to the ionic interactions with the solvent and also formation of hydrogen bonds with the water molecule .	117.36425617913665

Therefore their concentration usually at the site is much smaller because of the diffusional barrier and therefore the km value is …. .. In most cases they are usually considered to be an increased km value which is not a desirable feature .	48.96176687191472

So , the reaction rate also comes down , and till the reaction is over , so that is stage III , stage III gets completed when this reactions gets completed .	193.87627023102485

Here we pass it through a heat exchanger just to maintain the temperature fifty degrees and pass through the immobilized enzyme column .	136.15138646214118

So , the slower the heating , you will see the decomposition temperature , at lower temperature , where as higher heating will take to higher temperature , basically polymer cannot follow , the heating , if you are doing the heating in much faster rate , the polymer cannot follow the heating profile .	227.4224845818976

So , rate of polymerization molecule is high and because you are not using any other chemical solvents or other things this gives you high purity polymers and gives you minimum contamination of the product .	166.04432405226768

One of the major contributions of Michaelis and Menten was that he confirmed Brown ’ s observation that enzyme substrate interaction undergoes formation of enzymes substrate complex .	206.6796155997242

And you know for large N , large value of N i Stirling ’ s approximation gives you ln N factorial ; this is from your previous mathematical knowledge .	353.568837978632

In the characterization , I will talk on detail about the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and then polymer chain dimensions , and I also will cover in detail about various methods for measuring molecular weight of polymer , polymers .	92.43689076092603

That is the major constraint because the enzyme is located within the cell .	140.54640879789062

Because , 1 kinetic chain is getting broken down to 1 dead polymer and a another kinetic chain , which means , this is a chain breaking reaction .	78.99856419373384

These are the three major classes of continuous reactors but in practice a number of hybrids of these reactor systems have been proposed by people both in the case of CSTR as well in the case of plug flow reactors .	29.92453443520241

If you want to find out these , you have to know all these rate constant - k p 1 , k p 2 , k p n , k p 3 , k p 4 , and all this things ; that is practically impossible .	24.40671014195111

But the advantage is that the ultimate mixture of glucose and fructose is used as the product .	27.635715288440824

This clearly demonstrates the role of diffusional limitations on the effect of km and with the particle size increasing the system becomes more and more diffusion controlled for the particle is bigger .	183.74562209606697

This shift in equilibrium although not directly related in any way must be considered in conjunction with the rate of the reaction .	78.08550819918337

Even if the diffusional rate is very slow the substrate can reach to all parts of the enzyme go down to as low as possible and the ratio of the two that means the maximum reaction rate which you can get when you go down in the particle size to that of the reaction rate which is obtained by a particular particle size is defined as the effectiveness factor .	36.584453296483545

A 10 % error in calculation is usually taken for granted .	1430.2914722559337

For example if we consider these polyesters , when R is c h 2 4 , c h 2 4 is linear alkane .	153.31892368810557

There is an oxidation of AH and reduction of B and this can be done by two enzymes .	137.11676512902272

As I mentioned earlier , that this is your rate determining step , so the rate constant for this reaction is considered .	24.460276823802303

Or alternatively we take a water soluble polymer large molecular weight substance and mix the enzyme solution with this and the mixture is subjected to conditions by which the insolublisation takes place .	174.5992354981434

Now , in case for high polymers for high molecular weight polymers high molecular weight polymers again the probability is always the probability of propagation is higher because that is why it is propagating P also tends to 1 .	104.40102610180047

These this points where this two phase actually gets generates or the polymer become insoluble , they are called cloud points ; whereas for these composition , at critical temperature it will start forming two phase or polymer become insoluble , above this temperature , you can , you have any composition , they are insoluble .	252.18290657379163

And there are other possibilities using these where electron transfer reactions , examples given sodium and naphthalene , and as this , as if seen this propagation state , that termination is not present .	206.1717198651217

How to make a link between experimental data and the kinetic rate expression that was obtained by these two scientists separately ?	118.15335891690185

You need to make analysis of the enzyme reaction at the pH enzyme rate profile , detailed analysis to get the pK values of the amino acid residues involved and thereby make deduction .	125.27079927875894

A very crude definition could include it as a hybrid device where a biological recognition molecule or a cell or cell component is integrated with a physical or chemical detector .	562.1910492056237

So , it is same as if there was no expansion of the coil due to the presence of the solvent .	36.15289886163015

Now there could be three types of non - ideal solution ; one is a thermal where del H m is 0 , but del S m is not same as in case of what you have just seen for ideal solution .	53.09186208547626

The cost of production per unit quantity of the product comes down by over sixty nine point of total cost .	279.704817831657

I should think about the lower values of p , 97 percent , or even 90 .	386.88750759950494

But this is , you should have , you know , you should have knowledge , that during the chain , during the polymerization the chains can undergo exchange reaction between them and they can be subtle , like if you have two different , if you are starting with , say for example , if you are not starting with two monomers A and type , your type , you are starting with different oligomers and carrying out the reaction from there .	63.484227695898

It is generates when it propagate at the end is basically C H to Y C H to C H Y and so on .	250.54728003102983

And so the probability , that any conformation will have this two reactive function groups coming close to each other , so that they can react and form ring is always very low .	84.91608583966942

So , as more and more reaction is happening , more and more get , heat get generated , but fortunately the exothermicity or the amount of heat generated for in a step growth polymerization is not high .	91.98598557174931

The fractional conversion becomes constant with time .	76.01971248205247

They also can catalyze a number of stereospecific chemical transformations that are otherwise difficult to carry out in a single step by other chemical routes and also a major advantage of mild operating conditions which make them very attractive industrial catalyst .	239.22797047808822

For the first order kinetics this is the effectiveness factor as we discussed earlier .	23.39581776001592

Continue this here .	10732.294649875732

The boundary conditions in such a case will be x = l and S = Ss .	287.85541721973175

No , how the value of the R 1 and R 2 which is sincerely the monomer reactivity ratios , how they vary with the reaction parameters , and the monomer structure , what is the structure of monomer structure in the reactivity of the monomer reactivity ratios .	53.45036892961969

In the case of industrial operations , you always make a choice between two alternatives on the basis of the cost and effectiveness .	141.67986380509493

The third method is the reactor loading process .	44.91490386892748

You have k - 1 , k - 2 and also k2 , k3 .	30.869757759006433

If you talk about backbone stiffness , then they increase the modulus , and strength .	84.73945475320319

Theoretically the product in a plug flow reactor must come out exactly after the residence time of the feed stream but very often because of the deviation from the ideality of plug flow behavior it might come out almost in a slightly broad zone .	106.36102170495319

We also can form similar condensation polymers like polyamides .	291.1447470625926

The hydrolysis of ATP is a spontaneous reaction but in the absence of hexose it will hydrolyze only very slowly .	99.92228743332984

We have time , say it minutes , 200,400 , 600 , 800 and so on and this axis , we have percentage conversion .	223.9305685147764

So this is the molar ratio of monomer M 1 and M 2 , in the copolymer , any instance where the corresponding concentration of free monomer , in the reaction medium , given by this M 1 and this M 2 .	31.693169361412213

You can express them in either quantity , either as international units per gram of carrier loading or sometimes we can also refer them in terms of volume and thereby it can be compared directly to the soluble enzyme .	113.96583009955258

There will be a fall in the oxygen concentration , dissolved oxygen concentration which will be monitored by the electrode and this fall in dissolved oxygen concentration under steady state will be proportional to the substrate concentration .	73.26432684813801

It is k ln w p or S m by k ln w p will be given by minus N 1 ln .	63.428417174309345

Having understood the chemical and functional nature of enzymes , we will now move on to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	22.381775378362505

The fourth thing is that the ratio of Kí2 / Kím which you will recall from the basic definition of this parameter which is specificity constant or a pseudo first order rate constant for the enzyme catalyzed reaction Kí2 / Kím is small which refers to slow catalysis .	54.67971566896235

The fraction of conversion keeping the residence time constant and over operational time , this is operational time not the residence time , residence time is constant here it will go down .	145.9046647896021

So , basically if I want to compare , differentiate where you have a stabilized radical and a not stabilized monomer , stabilized radical plus a stabilized monomer , a not stabilized radical and not stabilized monomer , not stabilized radical and a stabilized monomer .	216.00929278883396

The third and probably , from the operational point of view , very important is stability because we must be able to use the same immobilized enzyme coating for a number of samples so that it is stable over a long period of time plus reproducible .	94.47501264836554

The first example that I want to illustrate with the use of immobilized enzyme is the production of L amino acids by immobilized amino acylase .	30.101395023344562

And non - bonding end to , and non - bonding pi star are very weak very weak absorption , which happens in this region 200 nanometer to 400 nanometer , which , so basically implies presence of nonbonding electron in the compound .	815.470249847356

Consider the situation in the bulk .	44.35009364313278

So , it may have much lower hydrodynamic volume per coil .	216.5214769867514

So , when you take this polymer at this stage and mix with the other additives and fillers and do a compounding which is a further process which you do in a melt state , as I said in the first lecture , then these functional groups are free to react at there .	85.0011870033258

So , at any point of time there are two possibilities , either you can have 1 polymerization is progressing with 1 propagating radical , or it have a 0 polymer radical polymer , 0 radicals in this .	87.82740139077416

So , the polymers must be biocompatible and hemocompatible if it is contact with real blood , anti - thrombogenic because it should not start the coagulation process .	469.78322433728795

When there is n number of binding sites the only difference is that the definition of Vm will change.Rest of the rate profile will remain identical and there will be no difference .	44.65517076200476

And then we range or rank those polymers species , depending upon how long they burn and how they burn , and whether they ignite that cotton , which is present below the sample .	503.4304478450972

Also many of the applications in beginning if you recall what I said that there are few applications or some applications where , though in not majority , a minor application of polymers where polymers are used in solution ; for example , eye drop where the water solvable suppose active polymers are used , detergents and there are several applications where you will find that polymers are added in solution .	169.26849810973462

They are also used in packaging material as like bottles , box - lids and they are also used in wire and cable insulations for electrical valve and they are also used in some of other uses of surgical and protective gloves .	785.7399408391967

v0 = vm S / km + S That means the magnitude of this exponential is negligible .	62.858591434892766

Energy of activation can be calculated from here which will be related to K * and also can be related to k2 and the two conclusions which we can make from make this analysis is that the fast reaction will have a higher value of K * , equilibrium constant for the conversion of reactants into the transition state or in other words the fast reactions will have higher concentration of AB * at equilibrium .	60.7600160229604

So , it will react with B , other side will be A , again this will react with B , so other side will be A .	15.283586610022999

The more is the polarity of these bonds , the more is the inter molecular forces between the polymer chains , which causes in effect more stiffness in the chains which makes the T g , which decreases the polymer mobility and which makes the T g higher .	94.09912506522922

If there is only AA plus BB tied molecule and obviously , f average 2 , when that can only happen when P is 1 .	343.7549082795326

So , in case of polyethylene , if you want to write polyethylene you know this is repeated and once you identify the constitutional repeat unit then you have to place this different parts of this repeat unit according to the seniority from left .	63.609336118118776

Conversion is related to the enzyme activity .	33.003752185316564

There might be two negatively charged , there might be one positively charged or there might be two acidic and one basic or more than that in the case of particular enzyme .	57.897600109717565

So , the reaction is very fast , so you can do it at low temperature in room temperature and it is usually done at a temperature between 0 to 50 degree centigrade .	21.395661949421587

Pressure drop will end the problem in the plug flow reactor because if you want to eliminate some of the problems associated with the internally bound diffusion in the system , the particle size has to be reduced and the reduction of particle size will mean increase in pressure drop across the bed and increase in pressure drop across the bed ultimately puts an economic barrier in terms of higher energy consumption for feeding the substrates and therefore in the case of very fine particles you can handle the system in a fluidized bed reactor without much pressure drop problems .	241.182234724241

Just to illustrate my point with the simple example of a dimer having two identical binding sites , the reaction mechanism can be written as ks k2 E + S ES E + P + + S S ks ks k2 ks 2 k2 P + E SE + S SES ES + P ( or ) SE + P In all the four cases of equilibrium , dissociation constant is ks which are identical .	189.29338741536077

So , it is is not very economic in true sense and as you as you saw that we have to use wider lot of organic solvent and handling that large amount of organic solvent recycling them , and storing them and is a environmental hazard as well storing and handling them this organic solvent .	341.1550836321786

There are many other smaller applications but these applications require the idea of methods of immobilization and their application for reactor design keeping in view the variety of issues that we have discussed in the past .	117.27530192776612

The substrate will also ionize and depending upon the true ionization state of the substrate which is accepted by the enzyme at the binding site , the fraction of the substrate which will get bound will determine the pH effects .	58.01818270988042

If you want to compare the reactivity of these different monomers , M 1 , M 2 , M 3 towards a particular radical , essentially dictate by the stability of these 3 propagating radicals .	56.12550790002096

The most commonly used method of cross linking the enzyme molecules is by the use of glutaraldehyde which possesses two aldehyde groups separated by a hydrocarbon chain , the three –CH2 groups .	52.15292631602672

A very important general observation is on the basis of the average composition of the proteins .	60.84650413373848

Now , these R , R dot can be produced by the hemolytic cleavage of this C H type bonds , in presence of heat from the polymer itself .	146.41009044104013

That means it is involved in the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to a given range of substrate .	145.89949530468473

Now , if they gets terminated by coupling reaction , the polymer which is formed here , that will have number of degrees of polymerization or total number of monomer present in that chain , will be twice nu .	48.76594271209547

Then in that case , you can live , build that high molecular weight leaving little excess amount of the condensate .	164.51007675239137

And the inherent termination reactions , as in the case of cationic polymerization by beta proton elimination , in that cationic polymerization case are not present here because beta hydride elimination is difficult .	71.74914877961997

That means the quantity of the enzyme required will be identical in both cases for carrying out the same conversion and at the same enzyme loading .	18.83024657812556

Then you should know the strategies if you want to have some functional group at the end of the polymers both side , then you should use the monomers containing that functional groups in higher amount and the ratio should be according to your target .	74.82719179912282

When this stable free radical polymerization is done through nitroxide , it is often called NM p nitroxide mediated polymerization .	616.6700480510776

Any analytical device in the form of an electrode , physical device which can be usually calibrated in terms of the concentration of the sample it is much easy to handle .	144.5414289711467

They make this process definitely , they make or they synthesize the polymer in the , polycarbonate in the plant them self .	331.1507011721404

This was originally proposed by Natta himself .	138.06330933798722

So , you must have , this you keep in mind , when you design additives for step growth polymers .	36.97143829526136

So with this , we conclude the discussion on determination of molecular weight by viscosity method .	18.992604260906816

So , for a open driven system with incomplete removal of the condensate k , again CO concentration H 2 O COH .	564.6223561255405

So , the initiation reaction actually depend on the first step , not atall on the second step .	121.57318696868097

Now , because the reaction is happening in the interface and at interface one one reactant is reacting with one of the other reactant .	107.91260033739988

And if your monomers , if your side reactions , which hinder the reactivity of a functional group , if you have some species , which is generating , which is affecting the reacting functional group , that also will hinder your , you know , reactivity of the functional group , hence the polymer formation .	104.84639831381784

Both the products find application in the food or related industry .	295.8210437910163

So , drop the percentage , drop in M n because of presence of non - polymeric small molecules , the effect of M n will be more than M w So , M n will be dropping more compared to M w .	87.46016585075111

For example , with highly elastic polymers like rubbers , they have low modulus 7 mainly about 7 MPa , stiff polymers which have higher modulus about 4 GPa and metals is is much higher , if you compare a polymer and metal , metal is much more higher modulus .	591.12686899652

In other words if you write down the reaction mechanism EA this is k1 , k - 1 and then this will go to EAB and this is k2 and k - 2 .	28.916404442128588

If they have alternate stereochemistry next to next monomers or next to repeating units , then as call syndiotactic , and if the stereochemistry of the repeating units is randomly placed , there is no order and then , they are named as atactic .	185.55471826685218

In addition to that , the understanding of the enzyme inhibitors or activators gives us very precise information on the specificity .	46.64350726062622

So , name has , will be polyoxyethylene instead of polyethylene oxide .	303.82858662794735

And if we write F 1 , is the molar ratio , or mole fraction .	36.536782667407444

Remember we just discussed in last lecture which just means this is not exactly , but this is approximately proportional .	85.67530170373945

The advantage of metallocene polymerization is that , as I said that this can happen in a homogeneous condition and at the end of the polymerization it can isolate the monomer , isolate the catalyst and purify and then we reuse the catalyst one more time .	69.86197023419824

So , if you replace one of the molecules , say , solute molecules or solvent molecules with another one , there should not be any change in the energy of the systems .	37.69280924522739

As you have seen that with decrease in temperature we get preferentially syndiotactic formation ; if we increase the temperature we get atactic formation .	75.57846137867409

That means they can act up on two or three different amino acids but most of them are very specific to a particular amino acid and they are produced and the DL - acyl amino acid can be hydrolyzed by the suitable enzyme which hydrolyzes or … .	116.26146112030659

As a catalyzed reaction , we are interested in the EAB * , which is the transition state complex which will give you a product at much faster rate .	35.93046358419984

If one of the orientation is preferred , much preferred , if one of the orientation of this incoming monomer molecules is much preferred over the others , then what happened ?	217.07508778027622

So , that is for the first solution theta c 1 .	98.39819572751271

So if there is a exothermic processes , delta T will be higher as a result of increase in heat , inside the sample .	56.552569741485335

This is one way to account for the non - ideal flow .	33.46268001604821

And , another very important point polymers which is made industrially by this technique is as we discussed several times is the polypropylene .	192.44143935494085

in Japan .	2321.7129032010025

You can call it NAD activated .	272.6702635063925

In all the situations the performance of the reactor is lowered compared to what we look for by analysis in the case of an ideal fluid flow pattern .	74.1495248385858

There is a insertion of this new monomer ; this new monomer in the alkyl carbon linkage alkyl aluminum linkage and forming again the original titanium… which will now add to the next incoming monomer .	305.1694756550344

If you are using adsorb preparation there will be a continuous reversible desorption process and leakage might be there .	277.50284954513234

So , light scattering from a polymer solution will depend biased ; it will be heavily dependent on the larger molecules , not the smaller molecules ; which means , the property like lights catering depend more on a M w , not M n .	271.1614259190316

Now when you mix this two , as it was mixed by Ziegler what happens , this forms beta form of titanium chloride which is brown in color .	223.15751927801085

So , you get more and more polymer with average molecular weight remain same .	31.756180906434874

When you take lower substrate concentration , 0.2M the activity loss is much , much higher and over the same period of time instead of 50 % it reaches to about 25 % and this is the case where if you recall we discussed the substrate dependent enzyme decay .	83.54553199917146

Now , how to get these delta value , the value of the solubility parameter ?	35.93198029534424

That is a definition of immobilized enzymes .	39.76203702006698

H * / RT ) The final conclusion is that for a catalyst or an enzyme in our case as we are talking about to be able to include the value of k2 , it must be able to reduce the energy of activation or increases the K * value that is equilibrium constant .	43.35053884399327

The F 1 versus no monomer the ratio of polymer composition is versus monomer composition curve is similar to ideal copolymerization , but skewed , but skewed towards the composition of the copolymer richer in the repeat unit resulting from the more reactive monomer .	283.22614809250894

If in this case , the centers or this have similar geometries , all these monomers are linked with same geometries are stereo stereochemistry , then we call this as isotactic .	386.714126757375

The independent subunits or the independent binding site implies that binding to one site does not bring in any conformational change so as to change affinity of other binding sites .	258.901867030703

So , the output signal in this detector is proportional to the concentration and if we assume that detector response is proportional to the concentration in the range we are working , and also this response does not depend on molecular weight .	69.77827754035566

Then the fourth property which is a very important basis for choosing the immobilization method is carrier cost and regenerability because each method has a limitation of the choice of carrier .	102.51825684356955

So , in this case lets draw for simplistic spherical micelles , so you have surfactants mainly as micelles , but also you have free surfactant in the water medium ; the concentration of this surfactants are CMC .	486.3896338459819

That means you take the monomers as such which ensures the maximum possible concentration of the monomeric unit .	57.107683481773904

So , with this we come to the end of discussion on gel permeation chromatography .	10.121685452161676

Both reactions involve addition of water and ammonia respectively on to a carbon , carbon double bond and give you the corresponding products malic acid and aspartic acid .	190.26564205897012

Given everything is other is same , transmission rate will go up for a smaller size gas , compare to a higher size gas .	731.1758367625192

Now pi is very small .	156.52108079899085

Now , when you use a plastic material like polycarbonate compared to a glass this becomes much lighter , you know its gives you lot of comfort than the glass .	210.3955272146185

Now , that aggregation could be , could be affected by temperature and it is actually lower temperature .	94.83060818267741

Now , this is between c and d you can clearly see that c and d are the binodal points… where is 0 between c c and e d and f the slope is changing in positive way so d pie 2 is greater than 0 .	146.11951965204165

Either inhibitor has to bind to the enzyme or the substrate has to bind to the enzyme .	27.782409649073323

So , f is the number of functional group present in this molecule .	14.911866012385774

Ded2S / dx2 – v ’ = 0 v ’ is the apparent rate of reaction that means under apparent kinetic parameters in the case of immobilized enzyme and De is the effective diffusivity .	86.828890343507

Then only you can compare .	103.37008482242643

And then it forms a cyclic transition state .	24.768967542638126

Now , entropy , sorry , enthalpy of mixing .	385.59893094694695

It will flow the solvent molecules will flow past each other ; it happens even for flexible chain if the coil size is little low , and that is dominant for this short chains .	215.59331577521468

So , if you , you can imagine as well , that as you grow longer and longer the number of conformations , which will enable the two functional groups at the present at the end to come closer and react and form ring will be lower and lower .	59.7204395391061

For example if you are going to immobilize this enzyme you can introduce a kind of a hydrocarbon chain before it is really coupled to the enzyme molecule .	42.141646964640664

Now , this , these are the examples where you do not have an inherent termination reaction .	17.83656498601826

Another way of this polymers ; the Zeigler - Natta polymers get terminated which chain transferred to the group one to three metal alkyl metal like aluminum alkyl , we just discussed .	97.0406684309931

The second effect of temperature in the case of a enzyme catalyzed reaction is the dependence of K2 that is the turn over number or the rate constant of the irreversible step of the conversion of ES into P and that classically follows a Arrhenius kind of a pattern that is K2 = A e - E * / RT We have seen this analysis even in our initial lectures on catalysis that means the catalytic pattern of the enzyme as the catalyst and one can again analyze in the same manner lnK2 = ln A – E * / RT Very familiar profile 1 / T versus ln K2 , you get a negative profile and this is a slope of E * / R and that gives you a magnitude of energy of activation for the given enzyme catalyzed reaction .	124.80825188066635

So , I can put another constant k 1 and eta square because there is no constant term because this passes through the origin .	82.89068009157761

Lysine has been most commonly used for covalent binding , next followed by cystein followed by tyrosine , histidine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid , tryptophane , serine , threonine and methionine as the rare case .	1251.6442825939873

So , this is the only one distinguishable way you can arrange a pure solvent or a pure solute .	54.75355778979243

If you look at the industrial applications until sixties there was not a very significant application of enzymes in industrial processing .	67.36954730715516

And we found that in general , flexible backbone , if you have a flexible polymer chain backbone Obviously , if I want to write here , if you have a flexible polymer chain backbone , then it is easier for somebody to apply stress and deform .	90.31489264342561

Let me once delta H m by delta S m .	91.8019148792063

If you notice the shift up to what I have already told you see pH effect change .	218.1837340570921

Yes only inherent kinetic constant and Ö.. ... When we assume that ?	515.7449550599084

The concentration of E - is negligible .	31.690377952199043

So , monomers with polar groups in the substituent will help in coordinating with the counter ion and the monomer ; the incoming monomer .	68.88310483246313

Now , it can be easily shown to have this expression ; let me show that .	65.88200396573176

So this can , this counter ion help in strong coordination between the active chain end and the polar substituent of the another monomer residues present in the chain .	63.6223737723201

In today ’ s lecture we planned to cover interfacial polymerization , and we also will be talking about different synthesis of different step polymers in very brief briefly .	69.93983329072948

Now , between styrene radical the propagating radical from astyrene polymerization , vinyl acetate polymerization this is much more reactive compared to a styrene radical generated from styrene molecule .	58.621286567618995

As a polymer chemist , you probably what have to do , the processing part or the characterisation part but then you must know the techniques by which , the processing is done or the techniques or the different properties , and importantly the structure properties relationship between the property and the chemical structure .	166.1516480096142

Till now what we have been learning for last several lectures is how to synthesize different polymers , how to make different polymers , we have learnt different types of polymerization by which we can make polymers .	89.9987997009076

How polymers are you know named and also I will talk about give you a prospective of the molecular weight of polymers .	71.65995937059286

Otherwise it cannot be used as a drug .	41.54138201642695

And in this lecture , we will continue our discussion on polymer solutions , the remaining part , and then start a new topic on chain dimensions , polymer chain dimensions .	30.464586480798825

Here you have the active site , the sites on which the binding groups available on the substrate binds and this portion shows the substrate which is analogous to the key .	69.77449275915525

We will continue in this lecture our discussion which we are having the last lecture on polymers in solution .	27.266118309115047

But the technical details of methodology for immobilization remain the same as in the case of enzymes .	106.63198982945838

The measurement of activation energy is also used as a kind of a experimental data to check whether the system is diffusion limited or not .	68.58731011114233

So both the things have to be really tackled so as to be able to apply enzymes on a large perspective like for example glucose oxidase can use large number of electron acceptor other than oxygen which can be then reduced at the expense of glucose .	137.17745819251425

And any region any point here would be meta stable one so in single curve , single diagram you can get complete phase diagram , it basically gives you the phase diagram of that polymer in that solvent .	243.027853529026

Now , how the molecular weight or degrees of average number average degrees of polymerization related to nu , it is twice nu , if the chains or the propagating radical terminates by coupling and it goes to nu , if the termination happen by disproportionation .	97.36766897237435

And we have found that to be true as well what we did not , which we did not consider is that giving polymer reaction , we know that is a H O thermic reaction .	79.14970454819358

These are the two molecular strategies which are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme .	22.805184375183188

Again there are companies sell these polymers in different trade names and this is not expressively .	297.19069029433774

So , if you do not mention T i nor if you just write T then ; that means , it is the initial temperature of the thermostated chamber .	127.9178753343613

So , I will , ethylene dyol ED , which gives you polyethylene teritarate , plus water .	453.37831346925356

So , in real case , incase of real polymer chain there are long range interactions , these are long range interactions which cause the chain dimension to be generally higher than the unperturbed dimension .	85.89047785466431

In practice while we get a preparation which is highly stable , we also get a significant loss of enzyme activity .	59.92837096809983

So , the collision frequency between the 2 molecules , 2 oligomer in this case , we will ; understand ; I am talking about the collision frequency between the two molecules .	21.137736708126326

They are very difficult to predict or estimate the reactivity ratios and as a result copolymer composition from given monomer structures .	86.34059994566091

Tryads , where we are talking about the three… center adjacent to each other ; like in this case , you have a meso pair and another meso pair .	58.31326951006718

The other one is non draining polymer molecule , which is the case for most of the polymer molecules , now in a linear flexible , any flexible polymer chains are closer to non - draining polymer molecule .	39.17763038306782

They will be from different groups as we mentioned from electron donating groups and withdrawing groups and one from electron donating groups .	239.48369579757133

Other examples also like peresters , let us talk about in next page .	89.84314046937361

For unknown sample , then how do you determine the viscosity average molecular weight ?	27.04114663981042

Now vinyl acetate , obviously undergo very fissile homopolymerization , but when you have a styrene as a second monomer .	224.99246185363052

You take a very fine small column and insulate it .	114.1350803636052

So basically in this case , energy supplied is plotted against temperature .	69.18505830119457

So , this keeps the entire distribution ; this is the normalized intensity and if you look at the gaps between the molecular ions you can see the gaps is 100 Dalton which is exactly the mass for a MMA repeating unit .	221.40420467154658

So , these are the examples of some of the solvents , which have , medium , low to medium polarity and does not high react with those ionic species .	82.0951773898093

Whereas M 1 star can react with M 1 star in some extent , so what will happen , you will get a something like this .	37.3503500869123

So , with with a use of this nanoclay , the base polymer it has improvement in modulus , tensile strength barrier and fire retardant property .	468.7934322459406

So , if you take a monomer , a polymerization mixture , the end of the things maximum number will be present at the monomers , then dinomers , then trinomers and so on .	99.5445009880815

Now , that happens if your polymer glass transition is is way above your room temperature .	128.1261119054922

The example of the glucose isomerase is a typical example which has used such a phenomenon .	108.53359449885092

Today we shall discuss about some of the issues and the future directions of enzyme technology that we are likely to face in near future .	264.8039953310039

And , if the rate becomes limited , you know , when they becomes equal , whenever the chain grows , the significant number in this case , say 3 .	222.62102023199103

The decay in the reactor performance will be more pronounced in the case of substrate independent thermal deactivation compared to CSTR .	19.360387349769496

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistr y .	45.08792251221384

There will be hardly any situation where a substrate concentration can change twenty seven fold or such a high level of change .	134.08656674848993

Now , if you have this of most of covers , all the conditions , all the criteria if you have need to follow a successful completion of a step polymer .	152.57881656814635

You can multiply it both side by and convert it to ; N 1 is the number of molecules solvent molecules and small n 1 lower case n is your number of moles solvent , number of moles of solvent .	150.3274200186539

Entrapment methods are also a very large class of enzyme immobilization methods that are based on the occlusion of an enzyme within a constraining structure .	225.87683209971476

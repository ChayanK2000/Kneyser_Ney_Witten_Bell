Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in today ’ s lecture , which is lecture number seventeen , I am going to cover or begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .	2.171352189340179

Now , in this lecture I plan to cover discuss the general characteristics of ionic chain polymerization , and while discussing I will compare how this ionic chain polymerization compares with radical chain polymerization .	2.754440261009658

And then we will go to cationic chain polymerization and talk about different types of initiation for cationic chain polymerization , and then go to propagation and termination reactions in cationic chain polymerization .	3.7755305829406263

And then I will talk about kinetics of cationic chain polymerization and then energetics of cationic chain polymerization .	3.746451388789652

And in next lecture , I plan to talk about the other type of ionic polymerization , which is anionic chain polymerization .	4.96747622817823

Now , let us begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .	3.9558987561529535

Now , as the name suggest , in this case the initiation is from an anionic species , whether it is a cation or anion .	4.3690658754386895

Say , if I consider M as a monomer and I is a , initiation , initiator , then it could be a cation or an anion , which will , according to which we name cationic polymerization or anionic polymerization .	2.9550101550587886

It could be acceptance of electron giving rise to a radical anion or removal of an electron , which gives to radical cation , which two of which might combine to give you a dianion or a dication which can further initiate the chain reactions from both the sides .	2.2382041570271043

So , this is example , this is a case of cationic polymerization .	5.367325899937474

This is a case of cationic polymerization and this two are the case of anionic polymerization .	6.334904091276483

Now , in this case , the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species , so as the propagating species also ionic .	3.263458582474083

Now , the some polymerization , for example , initiation by coordination or semi clock side , which also progress through an ionic species , propagating , propagates through ionic species route , but those we are not going to cover as an ionic chain polymerization .	2.268160198024104

Now , like radical chain polymerization , these ionic chain polymers , polymerization reactions are not very popular commercially .	4.484352055588848

One is that stringent requirement of polymerization in case of this ionic polymerization .	5.501539043915962

We require very , stringest , stringent conditions , which are difficult to achieve in a large industrial scale and also , this ionic polymerization are very selective , which means , that not every monomer can be polymerized by ionic polymerization , unlike , unlike radical case where most of the , poly , monomers , double bond monomers can be polymerized by radical chain polymerization we can assume .	2.9401823893984598

So , these are the main two reasons why this ionic chain polymerization , are not practiced that commercially in that scale .	3.0051029409748793

And so in that sense , it is not that important like radical chain polymerization .	4.496977829770564

However , this polymerization is ionic chain polymerization , gives us opportunity to synthesize specialized polymers , like block copolymers or tellically polymers , which are basically type polymers , having functional groups at the end of the chain , which we can , we utilized for the , for another reactions .	2.872766747224518

So , let us start the discussion on ionic polymerization and let us talk about first the general characteristics .	4.192492487640287

And while talking these general characteristics of ionic polymerization we will compare its differences or its likeliness with the chain , radical chain polymerization .	2.677773209447787

First is that as I just said , that it is , it is much more selective , much more selective .	4.822502008029394

Now , why do we started our discussion on chain polymerization ?	4.231637880879805

We talked about , that this monomers like this ether , which have electron donating group like there oxygen , which can be lone pair , can be donated if it is a cationic centre here .	3.1947166049774496

Now , this type of monomers can be polymerized by cationic chain polymer , polymerization reaction because the resulting cationic propagating can be stabilized by the electron donating , mechanizing donation by the oxygen from here .	2.919254951552974

Now , for anionics , for anionic chain polymerization we need to have monomers , which have electron withdrawing group , electron withdrawing group , which could be , as we discussed earlier , something like this , acrylates or methacrylates , and , and so on , with this can be polymerized anionically because the resulting anion can be stabilized by this resonating with the carbonyl bond .	3.3833222321473935

So , in that sense , this anionic and cationic polymerization at very and only if the monomer has , monomer with , monomers with , with inductive effect and ability to stabilize the propagating species by resonance in the , both for cationic and anionic , then this monomers can be polymerized by both cationic and anionic .	2.6185766523877203

So , if I write on the , complete this sentence , in that you can able to do , stabilize both cationic and anionic propagating species .	2.7109151147175496

For example , you have styrene where both cationic and anionic can be stabilized by resonance with this aromatic proof or say , cation , resulting cation or anionic can be stabilized by resonance from this double bond .	2.3959443159316476

As we see , we have seen now from this discussion , that not every monomer can be polymerized by anionically and there is a set of polymer , a set of monomers , which can be polymerized anionically .	4.109322777166627

And you know , less number of monomers can be polymerized cationically , and there are even lesser number polymers , which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization .	3.333907347659322

While in case of radical we have seen , that all this , this monomers or this monomers or this can be all polymerized by radical chain polymerization .	4.313383673461167

So , in that case , in that composition radical is a , radical chain polymerization is much least sensitive compared to the ionic polymerization .	3.772471051719308

Now , second characteristics , if you want to talk about , is the effect of polarity , effect of polarity of the solvent .	4.203517855815991

It is not only polarity , but the capability of the solvent molecules to solvate the ionic species giving the chain propagation .	3.4593625335790623

Now , as you have seen earlier , that a propagation reaction can be this .	4.97612047747067

It is either cationic species or anionic species .	4.205260249029466

For the positive it is a anion , for negative it is a cation .	5.788150513598341

So , this propagating chain are always of this ionic group , are always accompanied by a counter ion of oppositely charged , that is always happens .	2.5031351110474778

Now , depending on the association behavior of these two species , the active center and the counter ion , the reactivity of the propagating species varies .	4.454814922570107

What I mean , that if they are very tightly bound , they are very tight , then obviously , the accessibility of , or the reactivity of this ionic center are less .	4.21271573339878

So , the propagating species is less reactive .	7.002170780646676

While if you compare with the situation where they are well separated , they are like free , free hands .	3.8350838949404102

Now , if they are free , then obviously , they are more accessible and the reactivity of this propagating species , ionic propagating species are much more reactive or much more reactive compared to situation when they are tight ion - pair .	3.205730194843926

So , it is always preferred , that you have a polar solvent , it is , this is always preferred .	6.035995795025772

We do ionic reaction in a polar solvent because if you have polar solvent , then this oppositely charge ions , ions will be well separated in the medium and if they are well separated , obviously , the reactivity of the active center in the propagating chain will be higher .	3.7696628799878624

So , you have a higher rate of reaction or an eventually higher molecular build up .	4.596346314942916

Now , often if you use polar solvent , for example if you use hydroxylated solvents , hydroxylated solvents like say , H 2 O or alcohol , what happens ?	3.476710338945808

This , this reacts , this hydroxylated solvents react very , very fast , you know , very effectively they react with this ionic species and then stop the chain .	2.759020564454105

So , these ionic centers are destroyed with reaction of this hydroxyl , hydroxy molecules , H 2 O or alcohol .	2.9039955590083024

If you have other polar solvents , like say ketone , what happens ?	3.4560020019971516

This ketone loop complex form complex with this ionic species and then once they form complex , the reactivity of this ionic species are lost .	3.237697809782472

So , you do not have an effective polymerization happening .	4.1354904026228585

So , you require a polar solvent to have these charges separated and ions as free as possible .	3.068115481011935

Similarly , if you use very high polar solvents , like hydroxylated solvents or ketone , then the reaction actually gets stopped by reaction of these solvent molecules with the reactive species .	2.8520487376141506

So , eventually or practically , a low to moderate polarity solvents like , say methylene chloride or say , methylene dichloride or THF , or ether or nitrobenzene .	2.214228185531491

They , they actually can be used for ionic species polymerization , but this is , these are not very generic in the sense , that the solvents , this solvents also can react with anionic species as well .	3.656191652804896

So , we have , we will discuss specifically for the requirement of solvent .	4.772837198525712

We will talk about cationic and anionic polymerization individually .	5.041903493026678

Now , how this , if you want to write a , a generic structure of , say , to write , write a cationic propagating species , which have , which a cationic reactive centre and a counter ion , which is represented by A minus , so what are the possible states they can represent ?	2.812722147145802

One , they can be completely covalent bonding , covalent bonded , covalent bonded , one .	3.8849517115728416

Two , they can be tight ion - pair ; these are very tight , no solvent molecule in between .	4.503749394405967

So , tight ion - pair or sometimes it is called contact ion - pair or see , some people say intimate ion - pair .	3.2909407276033424

Same thing is called with different names .	4.6925466323151745

It can be present as solvated .	6.897898116947369

So , solvated has three solvated ion - pair or loose ion - pair or they can be totally free , free ion - pair .	3.4112778788515636

So , these are the possible , depending upon the polarity of the medium this could the four possible association state between these two ionic species .	2.970208735860652

Now , it , we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is B plus , is said the both cationic polymerization , the propagating species in cationic polymerization .	2.6790728144654814

But it can be true ; this post can be true for the other anionic polymerization as well .	3.8783141507732966

Now , obviously , with the increase in the polarity of the medium , if you increase the polarity of the medium , this , this , the more polar means , the ions get solvated and then finally , get as free ion , ion - pair .	2.817475938178997

So , as the reactivity of the ionic centre , obviously , the free is the ionic center it gets , it becomes more reactive .	3.185167112693305

So , which means and in some cases these , these are not present isolately , they actually remain in equilibrium and equilibrium shifts depending upon the polarity of the medium .	2.7981276454828263

So , in this way you can understand , that solvents play , solvent means , I mean polarity of the solvent plays a very important role in terms of reactivity of these ionic reactions .	3.635716793516551

And if you compare with radical chain polymerization , solvent polarity actually has no such role to play in case of radical chain polymerization .	3.3548933388587794

You have to only check whether the solvent can solubilize the monomer or the reagent and it , solvent should not participate in the undesired chain transfer reactions .	2.695341558931819

So , this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization .	3.6762315225838726

So , third characteristic we can talk about and compare the nature of reaction .	4.266698843452853

Now , this , these are complex reactions as we will find out from further discussion , that these are complex reaction and they are very fast .	4.259238252520847

They are fast ; they are about , say , 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 6 times of the reaction rate of radical chain polymerization .	3.9013996907109796

So , they are very fast and this fast nature of this reaction is due to the fact , that the accumulation of this active centers .	3.959324658510375

And as we will immediately discuss , that in case of ionic reaction , this bimolecular , molecular , termination bimolecular termination by reaction between two propagating species is absent or absent because they are anionic charge .	3.1643579761935112

One cation cannot react with another cation , cationic propagating species and terminate the reactions in case of radical .	4.402948043230139

What you have seen , that radical , two radical propagating species can react with each other and can terminate either by combination or by in case of cationic , anionic polymerization or cation polymerization .	3.3536876867380707

Because they have seen this propagation species are similarly charged , they cannot react with each other and terminate the chains .	3.3717164886406725

As a result , there is a huge increase in the concentration of these active centers in the medium and as a result , the reaction is very fast .	5.026822306919896

But in case of radicals we have seen , that the steady state concentration of the active radicals is very low and as a result , the propagation was comparatively low in a slower , in compression to these ionic polymerization .	3.6900477663331945

And as these ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to , very sensitive to impurities , which includes moisture because they are very active , reactive .	3.125190706966327

These ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to this impurities where you know , that radical , though radical chain polymerization are sensitive to impurities , but they are not as radical chain polymerization , is not as sensitive as in case of ionic chain polymerization and sometimes large effect of , large effect of cocatalyst .	3.410039168841055

Cocatalyst are nothing but small inorganic compounds , like say H 2 O , can be observed in case of ionic polymerization have , which was not the case of radical polymerization .	3.4026193372740234

And as I said earlier , this four is your , the termination reactions .	3.412057761740062

As I said , that bimolecular termination is not possible , bimolecular termination by the action of two propagating species is not possible and so if you can suppress the other , other reactions , which are chain transfer reaction , if you can suppress those , you can actually keep this chains , this ionic chains as living because you can , because the inherent or intrinsic termination reaction between the propagating species are not there , they are absent .	3.041653560511132

So , if you can stop the side reactions , which includes the chain transfer reaction , then you can actually make this chain alive or this polymerization could be living polymerization and that is especially true for anionic polymerization .	3.4552322713012407

You will find out in later discussion , that in case of cationic there are other ways , which are likely like chain transfer reactions , but in case of anionic it is comfortably easy to make polymerization , leaving chain polymerization .	3.027398662078178

Whereas , in case of radical , we know , that this termination can be possible by bimolecular reaction of the two propagating new species .	4.258633660139234

So , let us now talk in detail about the cationic polymerization .	3.7310058042838135

So , let us talk about and again , like radical polymerization if any chain polymerization , this cationic chain polymerization we were discussing .	3.9887501330079083

So , I should write cationic chain polymerization .	4.788970357203807

So , it consists of three steps : initiation , propagation and termination .	3.5627558938998662

First , let us talk about different types of initiation reactions , different types of initiation reaction and first one is , which is more common is , by reaction of monomer with an electrophile , say R plus and this electophile could be H plus , which you get it from protonic acids .	3.00219989313338

Now , if I write generic way , H plus plus A , generic structure of a monomer , it gives you CH 3 CH Y , cationic species , and A minus .	2.9822682512513317

This is counter A minus , is the counter ion .	4.3490526078772795

Now , HX would be strong enough if these acids should be stronger enough to produce significant concentration of the protonal species , so that it can initiate , react with the monomer .	2.7554294114007534

And A minus , the counter ion , should not be heavy , strong nucleophile because if it is a very strong nucleophile , then it can react with the cationic group and make a covalent bond and stop the reaction there itself .	3.82598250619503

So , your reaction stops there .	6.354861491603537

You cannot have the reaction progressing further .	5.016427355122166

They are used , they can be used because this counter ions are not so strong nucleophile like halide ions , but still this , this , because they are , they are also significantly nucleophilic , this cannot built very high molecular with polymers by cationic chain polymerization .	2.832381597675811

So , most , most popular , most important , this electrophilic reaction is reaction of Lewis acids .	2.6581124321042733

So , that is B , with the Lewis acid I can write generic structures like MX n for Lewis acids .	2.8085467559569883

Example could be BF 3 , AlCl 3 , SnCl 4 , SlCl 5 , ZnCl 2 , TiCl 4 , and so on , or they are derivatives , like RaCl 2 , R 2 AlCl and so on .	2.5202074655854596

So , these are Lewis , Lewis acid can be used for supplying an electrophile for reaction with the monomer , but it is this Lewis acids are seldom used alone .	3.4147433504972695

For example , if you take a reaction of isobutylene plus anhydrous BF 3 , anhydrous BF 3 , then there is no reaction .	3.6525586775652066

But at the moment you add little bit of water along with this mix , so you have the same reaction with BF 3 plus H 2 O , then there is a rapid reaction .	3.506139341977073

So , these examples showing as these Lewis acids , which we just showed in the last page , they are often used along with a second catalyst or cocatalyst , which can be water molecules or some other molecules .	3.021365826759049

We will just give examples in few minutes .	4.351029332246706

So , if you consider this case the reaction happens like this .	4.681031852297252

BF 3 plus H 2 O makes a complex or we can use other Lewis acids and we can use this alkyl halides as a cocatalyst and this case , the complex found is like this .	3.7089969721719376

So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor .	4.129378382821185

Now , this is called nowadays initiator because this is the species , which is supplying the H plus or R plus .	3.8389275454468366

This is coinitiator , coinitiator , BF 3 or AlCl 3 are , sometimes they are called this BF 3 or AlCl 3 , called catalyst and this initiator called cocatalyst .	2.4933720781289432

So , you should be careful about this nomenclature , other you called this as initiator and coinitiator or you called this as catalyst and this is the cocatalyst .	3.0110502498815697

Now , I can write generic reaction for this type of reaction .	5.561092378929431

Now , once you form this , again react with the monomer and form the initiating species , which let us write in next page .	3.5452951461105084

Similarly , you can write this similar reaction for this aluminum chloride and alkyl halide reaction .	3.696824472620481

This alkyl halide could be , say for example , R could be tertiary carbon or could be a triphenyl carbon group .	3.3489387645921624

So , this is example of alkyl halide , which is used for this cocatalyst or initiator in this reaction .	3.5202201956187404

So , I , I can write a generic equation or expression , say I , I for the initiator and YZ , this is for your coinitia , I for the coinitiator , this is for the initiator or this for catalyst and this is for the cocatalyst , giving rise to a cationic species and a counter ion .	3.1794991116190245

This is I and which then react with a monomer forming the chain initiating spices .	3.67404224821855

Now , we are writing ki for this reaction because it has been found out , that of these two reactions , this is the two reactions , consists of chain reaction , chain initiation reaction .	4.297149376715724

This , this is the step , which is rate determining step .	6.148455834950692

So , we will consider this reaction while calculating or while determining the , or looking at the kinetics of this chain polymerization .	3.28692697588382

Remember , if you compare with the radical chain polymerization , this was the first reaction compared to the step , the first step , where radical was getting generated from the initiator molecule and we considered that as a rate determining step for radical chain polymerization .	3.6609221688141593

But in this ionic chain polymerization we , this is the faster reaction step where this is the slower and rate determining step .	4.693423410017325

So , for ionic reaction monomer also participate in the chain initiation reaction where in case of radical monomer was not actually part of the chain initiating expression Now , the reaction rate also depend , depends on this YZ , which is basically a cocatalyst .	3.712029041100251

It will also influence the polymerization rate because the activity of the initiation complex depends how readily it can transfer a proton to the monomer and that in turn depends on the acidity of this cocatalyst .	3.028144615186784

For example , if I consider ionic , cationic polymerization of isobutylene by tin chloride catalyst , then the reactivity of this reaction or the rate of reaction follows Rp , follows in the order like this , nitroethane , nitroethane , phenol , water , which is basically the ranking of the acidity of this cocatalyst .	2.8017644913988877

So , basically the type of cocatalyst also influence the polymerization because the acidity of this , this complex , the activity of this complex depends on how readily it can supply this cationic species , where I say proton or in this case it is a proton or a carbocation to the monomer , and for a proton or protogen or a proton supplier , it depends on the acidity of the cocatalyst .	2.9323994369693254

So , it follows this trend and for the carbon cationic generator like RCl , like AlCl 3 plus , this reaction .	2.6340398184890814

Now , this reaction complex , the , the activity , the total polymerization rate dependence on this RCl is little complex and we will keep the discussion for this course .	2.6740208658848266

So , you should just remember that the , the structure of the cocatalyst also determines the rate of polymerization and also affect the rate of polymerization , and we will now see that .	4.184179168345183

Obviously , I , the catalyst or the coinitiator also affects the rate of polymerization .	3.677873047378483

Now , now Lewis , Lewis acid , we are talking about this reaction are the initiation , is by Lewis acids .	4.271632202912835

So , Lewis acidity of these defined metals increases with atomic number .	3.3562015549099433

We know that Lewis acidity follow this order .	3.9989885235407994

This Lewis acidity of this defined metals increases with the atomic numbers .	3.9130593701822156

So , for a single metal , say , if we consider titanium , then again the Lewis acidity increases with the oxidation number .	3.403225430196413

So , TiCl 4 have more Lewis acidity compared to , Tl , TiCl 3 than this .	2.878009056121368

So , for , if you compare with defined , different metal is basically atomic number .	3.5397674879559675

It will determine the Lewis acidity and for same , same metal is the oxidation state increases , the Lewis acidity increases and also the Lewis acidity .	3.255410857377273

For a single metal follow this trend of the ligand .	3.861778965677675

If this ligand , they follow this , so obviously , if the ligands are fluorine or chloride , they have much more Lewis acidity compared to the ligands are , this is , this is from your basic knowledge from inorganic chemistry , basic knowledge and this is , from this expression , you know , this is strongest Lewis acid and this is , not always we use this though it is a very strong Lewis acid , for all the cationic reaction .	3.468399736906995

We will not use this as a catalyst or a coinitiator because rather than other complication if the reaction , it is too fast , then the side reactions also come in the picture , the side reaction also increases .	3.371258743536399

So , though this trend is there , now while choosing the catalyst or the coinitiator , it is , it is not this general trend is always followed , you have to keep the other factors in mind as well .	2.940339939494435

So , we talked about the initiator reaction with by this reaction of the monomers with the electrophile .	4.267623189946791

Now , there are other initiation reactions , other initiation reactions , for example , halogen , halogen can be reacting with more acidic Lewis acid and gives out cation , halogen cation .	2.41268699463176

This can be initiation ; can be done by photo initiation of olium salts .	3.346841650354512

It can be done by electro initiation where cationic species is formed by electrolysis of any species present in the medium or it can be done by ionic , ionization radiation , like in the case of radical the initiation can be done by ionization .	3.453071918776248

So , these are the other possible ways of initiating a cationic polymerization .	3.6861106425015175

But as I mentioned in earlier , these are the generic examples , which we get in this page .	4.969296439910807

These are the most common example of or the most important initiation reaction .	5.106791817454964

So , energetic , we will consider this generic initiation step and also consider this initiation step , of , for the discussion because this is the most important of the initiation step we just discussed .	3.3166815961932294

So , let us now discuss the propagation step .	4.615857598780654

Propagation , we have already seen the different types of initiation possibility and as I said , we will consider the generic case , we , as I showed there .	3.794497156400395

So , this , this was the initiation reactions .	5.749689507895662

So , you have this initiator , coinitiator complex , which starts the chain initiation .	3.7752119500969124

I write this in the next page , it can react with the name and start the chain propagation reaction and I can write a generic expression of this in this way plus M kp n plus 1 M plus IZ minus .	3.6958203461879955

If Y is H , the photogens we can write H M n M plus IZ minus .	3.4771031874440235

For examples , that Ba 3 water case , I can write this is a proton donor .	5.100414972484777

So , I can write… This is the reaction of isobutylene catalysed by this reaction .	5.241923242494308

I just recall from your earlier decision , I am writing the propagating reactions here .	3.220575600231583

This , on reacting on with isobutylene , will produce the.. ... So , these are the examples of the propagating steps and sometimes this propagation reaction could be complicated and because of this one two hydride shift , but that is not very common .	3.1992212590222184

I will just give you an example when this propagating steps could be little complicated and by hydride shift or shift and that is applicable for say , propene or one alkene , one alkenes , take example .	2.670888667814523

Now , this can undergo a hydride shift and from this carbo cation .	3.711446596783051

If this happens , the reactions become very complicated and we call that sometimes isomerization polymerization as well .	3.161044803698469

The example we gave , most common propagation steps are in this page , what we just discussed now and as you can realize , that the rate of propagation will depend on the solvents .	3.7805052222825273

We discussed in length the effect of solvent polarity and if the polarity of the solvents is high , then this ion - pair will be more towards a solvated or free ion - pairs , then in the reactivity of this cationic species will be higher .	3.4659079051714454

So , the rate of polymerization will be higher .	6.266711627671845

Now , let us have , let us see some data related to convince that understanding .	3.480562116483061

Say , let us take example of styrene , polymerization of styrene by or chloric acid HClO 4 solvent is a mixture of CCl 4 and ethylene dichloride .	2.8870393405597

This is a dielectric , resulting dilating constant and this is your kp liter mole inverse second inverse .	3.2166437980811944

If you have pure CCl 4 , obviously , this is more non - polar , dielectric constant is 2.3 and the rate is low .	3.6509013586692958

When you increase the polarity by adding ethylene dichloride , dichloethane , EU , say in 40 - 60 mixture , your dielectric constant goes up , your reaction goes up .	2.574658247521044

If you consider further , 20 , 80 , 7 and this is 3.2 , 3.2 , 0 , 100 , 9.72 and this is 7 .	7.734428447426296

So , if this is the data to convince you , that if you increase the polarity , which is given by dielectric constant , the rate constant or the rate of the polymerization reaction increases .	4.6556505332876945

So , we just discussed the propagation steps , now let us talk about different possible termination steps in cationic chain polymerization and as one more time , that it cannot , termination does not happen by bimolecular reaction of the propagating species and generally , the termination happens by transfer reactions .	3.0402839633600807

For example , one beta proton transfer to either monomer or counter ion or say polymer itself , solvent or some impurities , which is present or a transfer agent , like the case of chain radical polymerization , we talk about the chain transfer is possible .	3.4743292703566975

If we consider the same examples of isobutylene polymerization by BF 3 and H 2 O , this can transfer beta proton to the monomer and can form this and plus the 2 2 beta proton , one is here and one is this hydrogen .	2.821836151679683

So , one , depending on which proton is leaving you can get actually two structures with double bond .	3.019535230810613

If this comes out , then you get a chain end with CH 2 .	5.180063598755353

If this proton goes out and if something , one of the protons goes out from there , then you get CCH and that is possible , these are possible for other monomers where this is , these two types of double bond is a possibility .	3.1896385349663876

For example , like you have alpha methane styrene in case of , say , example , the monomers like styrene , where you always get only one possible double bond because there is only one possible beta hydrogen to be eliminated .	2.9703921904133974

So , this is very common , this is very important termination process and it could be , this termination could happen to one of the , or any of the other agent as well .	4.155460548244894

We just gave an example with the monomer and what we will do in the next lecture , we will talk about the other termination possibilities and will discuss the kinetics and the energetics of the cationic polymerization , cationic chain polymerization and then also discuss the characteristics and other features of anionic chain polymerization .	3.124817639414673

We have been discussing so far the steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors .	3.045818058745446

We have discussed yesterday about the external film diffusion that is in cases where we consider nonporous matrices .	3.4192658247553136

Under steady state condition , the rate of mass transfer can be equated to the rate of biochemical reaction and then by analysis one can come under two extreme conditions ; one under high substrate concentrations we get a Lineweaver Burk profile which is analogous to ordinary soluble enzyme kinetics and in the case of low substrate concentration that is in this case ; low substrate concentration and high substrate concentration you get differences in slopes and the measurement of slope at two distinct stages of Lineweaver Burk plot gives you an estimate of the value of mass transfer coefficient .	3.147864064791436

You do film diffusion klam can be computed .	4.121133603816047

Therefore based on the observed reaction velocity in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor one can determine the value of Sb - Ss that is the substrate concentration gradient and the magnitude of this determines whether the reaction is diffusional limited or otherwise .	4.275554954744213

If the Sb - Ss is zero or very small quantity then there is no diffusional limitation .	3.936956157915392

If the magnitude is large or Sb is much , much larger than Ss in that case film diffusion is the dominant player and so the nature of Lineweaver Burk plot under the range of condition of substrate concentration can give you an idea of the mass transfer coefficient .	3.2158187719165854

We are now looking at a general approach to understand the external film diffusion .	3.5530228182927526

We determine by some experimental method or an analytical method or an empirical equation the magnitude of the mass transfer coefficient and the magnitude of mass transfer coefficient will give you the magnitude of the concentration gradient and so another alternative route to estimation of mass transfer coefficient has been from empirical relationship what we call as JD factor .	3.0377093117081233

A JD factor has been defined in the case of heterogeneous catalysis in general and which applies very well to even enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.13706128385514

JD factor is defined as a lumped parameter which takes into an account the mass transfer coefficient particularly field diffusion coefficient as well as the reactor operational parameters .	3.2112473854866788

The JD factor is JD factor = ( kL ?	4.860499423753838

/ G ) ( µ / ?	29.66920319716651

D ) 2 / 3 This is the … .	24.632081789015768

number , Nsc .	28.103256389722233

The first term in the parenthesis represents the mass transfer function ; the other is dimensional number which gives you the operational parameters and here kL is a mass transfer coefficient ; ?	3.2693586931413297

is density , G is the superficial mass velocity and µ is the viscosity ; row is again density and D is the diffusivity .	2.679916180381562

It has been shown at least empirically in a large number of experimental data that JD is equal to JD = C ( Re ) - n A very general relationship for JD factor has been given that it ’ s a function of Renault number to the power minus n and under different conditions of particle shape and the range of Renault number the magnitude of C and n varies and that can be estimated for a particular system .	2.7640023621081475

If you look at this one , you will notice that from the estimation of JD factor as a function of C , Renault number to the power minus n one can determine the value of kL .	3.2447445039378437

Because kL will be equal to kL = JD.G / ?	5.2471225118437586

.Nsc 2 / 3 If you convert this magnitude of kL is related to JD factor by JD value and also a combination of the reactor operational parameters ; superficial mass velocity , density and …. .. number .	2.883128535781791

The magnitude of kL then gives you at steady state , the reaction rate .	4.15341347999266

That is v ’ = kLam ( Sb - SS ) = rm Under steady state both the biochemical reaction and the mass transfer rate are equal .	3.3017051519642613

This v ’ can be considered as the observed reaction rate which has been monitored experimentally and therefore one can determine the magnitude of Sb - Ss and that determines whether the diffusional control is there or not and accordingly one can design the reactor .	3.095738698843515

JD can be computed from a variety of correlations as I mentioned .	4.854352015747077

One of them which have been applied is developed by McCune and Wilhelm .	3.47157794842005

For spherical particle JD is equal to JD = 1.625 ( NRe ) - 0.507 This is one of the relationships which have been proposed but a large number of such empirical correlations are known .	3.48334750230951

Once the magnitude of kL is known then one can really incorporate the value of kL into the rate constant of a reactor performance equation .	4.507429963701759

In most of the practical cases whether it is a plug flow reactor or a CSTR , the error involved in assuming the whole reaction to be under a first order regime or a zero order regime is not very large depending on initial substrate concentration .	3.4157482561316046

For example in the case of CSTR , life is much simpler ; if the fractional conversion desired is very high even at a high initial substrate concentration , the substrate concentration in the reactor will be quite low and that is the substrate concentration which is going in the outlet stream .	3.9634547326515244

So a first order approximation is not something which is invalid and as I mentioned earlier if you take certain data roughly an error of about ten percent in calculation of the space velocity is encountered .	2.8487539765218464

Similarly in the case of PFR , because the enzyme loading is very high usually in PFR , a large fraction of the reactor also experiences a low substrate concentration .	4.068823946059584

It also experiences high product concentration .	5.090351856970439

But substrate concentration keeps reducing and towards the end of the reactor , the substrate concentration will be very low and one can assume a first order kinetics .	4.959805951867689

If you consider a first order case , then the reaction velocity will be v ’ = kf amSS kf I have defined here as a pseudo first order rate constant which is based on surface area ; not volumetric rate constant ; but the surface area based rate constant just to have a dimensional homogeneity with the mass transfer correlation .	2.7565278321470417

kf is equal to a pseudo first order rate constant for enzyme catalyzed reaction which is k ’ 2E0 / K ’ m .	5.09372611782647

Therefore rate of mass transfer is rm = kLam. ( Sb - SS ) In the case of a non - porous particle the issue is to develop an expression which gives you the substrate concentration at the surface because the reaction will take place at the surface of substrate concentration .	3.763266480579485

If you equate the two that is v ’ = rm , that will imply that kf amSS = kLam. ( Sb - SS ) Therefore from this substrate concentration on the surface can be calculated as SS = kb.Sb / kf + kL or the observed rate is kL.kf.am.Sb v ’ = kf + kL Then the actual rate constant which incorporates the film diffusion coefficient is this parameter .	2.2696700569387396

kf apparent will be kL.kf.am kappf = kf + kL In your reactor design equation you can incorporate , instead of first order rate constant as this one which is based only on biochemical reaction , this rate expression .	2.623072045807339

kL can be determined either from experimental data from the Lineweaver Burk plot or from empirical equation of the JD factor .	2.8702238358864607

am is determined experimentally based on the geometry of the particle and kappf can be determined .	4.445573298685155

kappf can be used to designate the reactor performance of the first order immobilized enzyme reactor with film diffusion limitations or film diffusion control .	4.427363033872327

Another way again an empirical way to look at the film diffusion has been proposed by Satterfield .	3.7476046897341275

I must here again point out that the whole analysis of the immobilized enzyme reactor has been largely dominated by chemical engineering literature particularly with reference to heterogeneous catalysis because the systems are very identical excepting the thermal , specificity aspects which are attributed to enzymatic reactions but the catalysis part whether it is a heterogeneous catalyst in the case of chemical engineering that means a catalyst supported on a solid matrix .	2.6605460463470414

But all the analysis is identical and Satterfield also provided a single point reactor performance equation based on film diffusion control for heterogeneous catalyst .	2.665405944245106

He defined a parameter Z as equal to e NRe2 / 3.NSe2 / 3 Y1 Z = ln 1.09 av Y2 Here sigma is voidage as we are familiar ; Renault number and the semite number and av is the ratio of particle surface area to reactor volume and Y1 is the mole fraction of substrate in feed ; Y2 is equal to mole fraction of substrate in the product stream and Z is the length or the height of packed bed required for mass transfer .	2.5810444677655795

That means Z is the height of the length of the packed bed required to transfer the substrate concentration across the film as a function of Renault number and Semite number purely on the basis of mass transfer control ; no biochemical reaction is assumed here .	3.075305425335273

If the mass transfer has to be incorporated this much of length of the reactor is required under these operational conditions to have the substrate concentration equivalent to biochemical reaction .	3.673762735076195

That means to make Sb - Ss equal to zero , without any biochemical reaction this much of height of the reactor is required under these operational conditions .	2.844461012435584

Based on the operational data that means the concentration of substrate in the feed and the product stream as well as the parameters of the reactor operation and the particle size , one can determine the length of the reactor required and if this length of the reactor required is relative to the length of the reactor required for biochemical reaction , if you compare this height required , let us say this is Z1 to that of the height required Z2 based on biochemical reaction if you calculate idealized reactor performance equation and calculate the height of the reactor required and compare the two values that gives you an identification whether film diffusion is controlling or not .	3.4195704259279482

The one which is larger has to be used .	7.5687088495239285

So for example let us say if this Z is much , much smaller than the height required for biochemical reaction then you don ’ t have to worry about diffusion .	3.360519718233063

You simply design your reactor on the basis of biochemical reaction and be happy .	3.898256392836779

On the other hand if this height required is reasonably high then you forget about biochemical reactions and design the reactor based on diffusional requirements based on the mass transfer coefficients .	2.5940560947734754

This is the height of the reactor .	5.69859707674228

This is basically empirical equation depending upon the reaction operational data the height required for effecting the mass transfer across that film .	3.0626019309552555

Right ; only Z1 ; you don ’ t bother about Z2 .	4.267394172684901

You then don ’ t have to bother about the biochemical reaction because in that height reaction would have already taken place .	3.076437495126165

Yes . Exactly what we are assuming here is that there is no reaction within the pores of the particle .	4.160027949419622

All the enzymes are present on the surface and in the thin film there is no reaction taking place .	5.397517537628319

You must appreciate the difference between the internal pore diffusion and external film diffusion while in the case of internal pore diffusion during the transport of the substrate in the particle reaction is also taking place whereas here there is no reaction taking place along with the mass transfer ; its only mass transfer .	3.2760931263645565

Only difference is that between the bulk and the surface where the reaction is taking place there is concentration gradient and ideally if the diffusion control has to be out of picture in that case the concentration gradient should not be large and this concentration can be reached if you assume that there is no substrate consumption at the surface .	3.1181225347334833

Normally what is happening is that this substrate is getting transported from bulk to the surface and at the surface reaction is taking place .	3.787252498118639

It will take some time whereas if the biochemical reaction is also taking place at the substrate then that length required will be given by Z2 at substrate concentration Ss .	3.3337811229975927

One of the two , which is larger , is required to be considered .	6.1079390070561805

This is what we were talking about the external film diffusion and the other part of the whole story of the steady state analysis is related to internal pore diffusion .	4.2714184633429335

In the case of porous matrices a very large quantity of fraction of total enzyme which is immobilized is within the pores of the particle .	2.8972675835985737

The quantity of enzyme immobilized on the surface is in fact very , very small compared to total surface area in which the whole enzyme is distributed inside the pores of the reactor .	3.9378437653534646

Therefore it will become very important that we look at the concentration of substrate available for the enzymatic reaction within the pores of the reaction .	4.8052591621856

Very broadly the effect of internal pore diffusion in a very simplistic way is described for isothermal reaction incorporated in the pore diffusional effects by k ’ 2E0Ss v ’ = ?	3.378693541735083

K ’ m + Ss I mentioned Ss that means I am excluding the film diffusion .	3.0524806875129986

Whatever concentration of substrate that has reached at the surface from there to the pores of the particle we are considering .	4.0340687974690566

We will consider the case where the two parameters or rather all the three biochemical reaction , external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion are taking place .	3.475179574969371

But at the moment we are talking only of biochemical reaction and internal pore diffusion assuming that the transport through a film is fast enough and it does not create any problem .	3.076940796794973

That means there is no concentration gradient across the film .	5.40997233518116

In this case this is defined by a factor ?	5.553558437472565

which is called as effectiveness factor .	7.568359103558207

This effectiveness factor is the ratio of the rate of actual reaction in the matrix divided by the maximum reaction rate obtainable if there was no pore diffusional resistance .	4.729239217524897

That means a very physical conceptual picture of effectiveness factor can be considered .	3.9028849540435524

That is if for example you take a particle let us say of one millimeter diameter ; determine the reaction rate and then also take a particle let us say of ten microns or twenty microns diameter in which we assume that the pore length is very , very small .	3.0255901523805897

If you consider a very hypothetical condition a single pore as a part of the matrix .	3.4574226408832702

This is surface ; this is thin film .	4.3135786062691945

You have Sb here ; you reached Ss ; there is no substrate concentration gradient but then here onwards there is a gradient .	3.4699771988467183

There are two things you must appreciate in contrast to the film diffusional effects .	3.0428873298277583

One is that there is a rate of diffusion ; the substrate will take some time to reach to the different sites of the enzyme present in the pores .	5.2911522673389175

The other is the substrate is also getting consumed during the reaction .	4.6525452627367105

So therefore if suppose the bulk substrate concentration is itself very low there is likely hood that by the time the substrate reaches to the inside pores , center of the particle there is no substrate present and reaction cannot take place even if enzyme is there .	2.5847904505910737

Ultimately when you will measure the enzyme activity you will see that the enzyme activity is low because per unit enzyme loading the activity which will be expressed by the immobilized enzyme particle will be lower .	4.0820300345453955

So therefore if particle size is reduced you get an advantage that the fraction of the total particle which is receiving the substrate increases coming to one when the particle size is too small and usually in most cases as per the experimental experiences that a particle size about thirty microns in most cases of the biochemical reactions has been considered to give you an effectiveness factor of one .	2.7478303946030054

You will see from this relationship that maximum effectiveness factor can be one because that means the you have a enzyme reaction rate under the condition when the whole enzyme particle is flooded with the substrate , the same substrate concentration what is present at surface is present across the particle , at all surface at all the pores and under that condition the effectiveness factor will be one .	3.1279235162771046

That is what is the ultimate limit and the internal pore diffusion effects are described by effectiveness factor .	3.7121937204942523

There is very tricky situation ; in many cases people have also reported effectiveness factor exceeding unity ; experimental observations .	2.6963021435787304

Under what conditions the effectiveness factor should be more than one ?	5.312610865148458

The first condition will be the enzyme kinetics where substrate inhibition is very strong .	4.8964265299291965

The enzymes that are very strongly substrate inhibited may show an effectiveness factor greater than one because the reaction rate when the substrate concentration drops becomes higher than at the surface .	3.6442723246235857

If the substrate concentration is high at the surface the reaction rate is low .	6.277781527772276

When the concentration goes down , reaction rate increases and therefore the effectiveness factor is one .	4.594890383231958

The other alternative case of the effectiveness factor exceeding unity is that of a case where we experience partitioning effects particularly … .	3.6519961705198463

pH . If suppose the product of the reaction provides you a change in the micro environment ; let us say hydrogen ions are produced .	4.9882270290941895

Take a typical example of alcohol dehydrogenase .	6.149787589288795

The reaction product ends up in hydrogen ions ; there will be a pH change and that pH change enhances the enzyme activity .	3.3625881508523032

Then also we will notice the effectiveness factor to be greater than one .	5.1770084401510115

So there are two extreme cases where effectiveness factor show discrepancy from the theoretical understanding .	2.9194595677055277

In the case of strongly substrate inhibited enzymes , if the concentration of substrate at the surface is high then for substrate inhibited reaction , the reaction rate will be low and because of the pore diffusional parameter the substrate concentration across the pores is reducing .	3.903285561602105

As we saw here the substrate concentration goes down along the pores and substrate concentration going down means the react rate of reaction increases .	3.5117083272281535

When you take the whole particle in account then the bulk of the particle experiencing lower substrate concentration means higher reaction velocity and so therefore this ratio will become more than one or in other words if you take two particles one of larger diameter other is smaller diameter the reaction rate in the larger particle may be more than in the smaller particle .	3.1016976347140877

That is what it means by effectiveness factor of one and in many cases of substrate inhibitor systems this is a usual pattern which is noticed .	3.5167517601525713

No . When there is a partitioning of hydrogen ions and the conditions are such that the rate of reaction as a result of partitioning increases that is the condition .	4.838114954180811

If the partitioning creates unfavorable conditions for the reaction then it will not be more than one .	5.483538927096031

Only when the hydrogen ions are produced and the micro environment created by the reaction in the form of product .	4.294163778318502

No . The comparison will be only when we take the same reaction and in reactor performance equation in addition to internal pore diffusion you also consider partitioning effects .	3.816219467348653

Then you cannot really compare the two only by a steady state analysis or mass transfer and biochemical reaction .	3.2774253403941715

You must incorporate partitioning effects also in the steady state analysis .	4.6881217496257035

At the moment we are talking only of mass transfer and biochemical reaction .	4.047566640359032

Partitioning also can be incorporated and which can give you a real performance .	5.61360030921507

In the case of internal pore diffusion a steady state analysis can be made .	4.399113742992499

In a simplistic way we consider a pore to be a single cylindrical catalyzed pore .	3.7440512907294896

We assume in a very simplistic way that the enzyme is taking place in a cylindrical pore .	5.850292299739565

Consider a small differential element in this pore and along which the mass balance can be made .	3.0155519387229517

This is Ss , the substrate concentration on the surface and this goes down across the pore .	4.560722835866977

This is dx the length of differential element .	4.994891412833918

If you make a mass balance across this differential element at steady state you see the output of the substrate will be –pR2.D ( ds / dx ) out .	3.2001615312000484

R is the radius of the pore .	9.747511149881694

dS / dx is negative and this is output of the substrate from the pore .	6.284790682357002

Input is pR2.D ( ds / dx ) in .	4.710169031890689

The conversion as a result of biochemical reaction is v ’ ( 2pR ) dx .	5.039205186299651

At steady state : –pR2.D ( ds / dx ) out + pR2.D ( ds / dx ) in + v ’ ( 2pR ) dx This should be equal to zero as at steady state we make a mass balance of substrate across the differential element we get this .	2.66194772870511

I must again here remind one thing ; this reaction velocity is based on surface area and not volumetric reaction velocity as we are usually used to in the case of soluble enzymes .	3.4192082065635394

v ’ is based on surface area unlike in the case of soluble enzyme where we usually represent based on the volumetric reaction velocity and that ’ s why we have multiplied by 2pR .	3.3421661184337017

Here you can make modification ; if you transfer the reaction velocity in the volumetric form like for example kV = kS.S These are the two rate constants ; zero order or first order based on volumetric and surface area and in that case for a cylindrical pore the k will be equal to k = kS.S / v = 2kS / R Therefore one can write here as d2s / dx2 – v ’ = 0 as the basic second order differential equation a solution of which can give you if you substitute the reaction rate term here depending on the nature of the reaction either by assuming a first order kinetics or zero order kinetics or even Michaelis Menten kinetics and Michaelis Menten kinetics will require a numerical solution and analytical solution may be difficult and you can get the solution of the substrate concentration as a function of the distance x from the surface .	3.114098699774414

A solution of this will give you the substrate concentration profile in the pore or inside the particle .	4.781599441568957

No . Sorry diffusional coefficient will come here .	4.909652667017809

It is not going .	10.1204937033031

We have multiplied here too or v / D either way .	3.4991569500844877

This can be written for variety of cases and solved within boundary conditions so as to give you the reactor performance .	3.8780441326347246

I think we will now stop at this point .	3.9357785224736537

Welcome back to this 8 th lecture of this course in Polymer Chemistry .	3.097238905079102

And at the end , I planned to just give a summary of this module on step growth polymerization .	3.5391010691326055

And I will be telling you what is my expectation at the end of this module .	3.7169278568804316

Now , let us look at the whatever topic we covered in the last lecture .	3.647957618713707

In the last lecture we have covered the cyclization verses linear polymerization , what are the conditions which prefer linear polymerization , which are different the preferred ones .	3.039881193782595

We also discussed various way of making branched and cross linked polymers .	3.2760962415154102

And we also studied in that context that in case of branching reaction going on the molecular build up is higher for a given conversion in comparison to a linear polymerization .	3.7114507253327775

And at the end we discussed the complete list of conditions or the criteria , which one must be maintaining during the polymerization or at the beginning of the polymerization to have a successful step polymerization .	3.6858326756038364

I mean by successful , I mean a building of the molecular weight of the polymer , which is targeted and in most cases it is a high molecular weight polymers .	4.292829885432403

Now , suppose you have done everything right , whatever instruction is given to you in the this course or in any text book , you have followed everything right .	2.5606710913181936

You have taken monomers in a ratio very close to r is equal to 1 and you have done the reaction at high temperature for longer time , try to take out the condensate for you know as much as possible .	3.420860410772254

And you have done whatever I have been instructed to you have done that .	3.8425429114696583

In spite of doing that you found that at the end of the reaction your desired polymer has not formed .	3.1912017879755075

That means , you must be expecting a high molecular weight you have got a low molecular weight polymers .	4.164729957818416

Now , what does it mean it does not mean it all the instruction given to you are incorrect , you have to deep you know look into deep what might have happened .	2.6494553650228543

And I just I will give you few guide line in the deep something goes wrong in spite of doing your best possible way ; now what are the things to look for and let us look one by one .	3.026777588735808

So , there is a guide line for trouble shooting , now you must be capturing the condensate in a trap will distilling of the condensate byproduct you must be you know must be collecting that in a trap .	2.634930226938465

Now , you analyze the end of the reaction , you analyze that that material in the trap and see whether you found any monomers in there .	3.165049324196872

Now , if we find any monomer there , which means that during the polymerization one or more than one monomers has escaped by volatilization .	3.64941256799902

And that is going to imbalance your monomer ratio , you must have you might have taken one is one ratio or whatever very close to one what is your target molecular weight .	2.8268799979059294

But still , because one of the monomers might have volatile in excess than other , which will imbalance your stoichiometric ratio and which will definitely going to decrease your final molecular weight .	2.709563663573335

Now , what are the ways you can tackle this , one thing you can do if you find that their monomers are getting volatilized during the reaction .	3.1134097161517666

You can start slowly , which means that you take a you take the reaction and carry out the reaction for some time at a lower temperature and at atmospheric pressure .	4.158499651086877

And when a reaction has progressed some for some duration and then duration there is a chance that monomers might form dimer or small molecular weight , oligomers .	2.8160627711191024

Then their volatility tendency of volatility would come down as their molecule weight increases increased by this time .	2.7454845945105015

Now , if you apply the vacuum or reduce the pressure , then chances of you know vocalization of the monomers comes down .	3.5620503528608567

So , what you can do in reaction you can do in the steps , you can do the first step in a lower temperature and at higher pressure and then slowly increase the temperature and reduce the pressure .	3.7894863423695933

And at the finally , when your molecular weight the conversion is you know quite high , there are less amount of monomer present in the reaction medium , you ramp the temperature as high as possible , you know and then you reduce the pressure as much as possible .	3.3010746567347224

So , that is the one way you can reduce and the volatility of the vocalization of the monomers .	3.391464038140513

Second thing you can analyze the product , if the product is colored or if you by analyzing the reaction mixture of the end of the product at the end of the reaction we find there are new molecules .	3.899976679186393

And specially look for the chain stoppers which are mono functional molecules , if you find them which means it is as a result of degradation or a side reaction there would be either imbalance in the stoichiometry .	2.894117006546428

Or there would be generation of this mono functional chain stopper , which will which will stop your polymer chains to progress further .	3.0408209438544667

So , that will again reduce the molecular weight build up .	4.795694130778832

And what you have to do to tackle this you will understand what is going on and understand the chemistry behind this side reaction and then do whatever now your best way to minimize this side reaction unwanted reactions .	3.014985998452707

And sometimes the catalyst , which you are using in the reaction that might be one source , which might be catalyzing the side reactions as well .	3.545450137937615

So , you might consider chaining the catalyst or even reducing catalyst amount in the reaction .	3.0008671187797114

So , that your side reactions comes down as low as possible , one side reactions we can consider during polyester formations .	3.161508055803384

So , with this you can generate free acid group and a alkene group here , at this is very common by if you have a beta hydrogen present then by doing a 6 membered considered reaction , it might do a side reaction .	3.1149225284281736

And you can end up getting new functional group or new products , which might give you color in the at the end of the reaction , so that is one example .	3.5103347493031993

So , third thing you can do as I was mentioning is that you change the catalyst or sometimes catalyst a I said might accelerate the side reactions as well .	2.9999730137252603

Now , so these are the things you can try out , if your reaction goes wrong and of course , if this nothing else work with this you might have to consider changing your reaction monomer , you are changing your monomers all together .	2.9056980401433874

Now , let us go back to the last lecture , we talked about that the k rate constant for step polymerization is quite low 10 to the minus 3 liter per mole per second .	3.8333645450515004

Now , there are few exceptions , there are actually very few exception , one example is the reactions with diacid chlorides .	2.9525434625915636

For example , if you have diacid chloride , chloride plus diol forming polyester polyester , say diacid chloride plus diamine polyamide .	2.6385012724394934

Now , these diacid chloride reactions with dial or diamine there are very fast and k r of the order of 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 5 L in term of per second inverse , which means they are much fast reaction compared to the normal step polymerization reactions .	2.8136584863809286

And this first reaction are you know the has been taken that , this the fastness of these reactions has been taken .	3.596957770581092

And it has been used in making polymers by interfacial polymerization .	5.146589418278152

And I will come to the example of interfacial and polymerization .	5.257319588783226

Interfacial polymerization reactions are happened in the interface between 2 liquid phase , 2 monomers are taken in two different liquid phase and the reaction happen in the interface .	3.465079486615188

For example the polycarbonate , most of the polycarbonate major rate of the polycarbonates are synthesized by this interfacial polymerization bisphenol this is the monomer bisphenola .	4.168628558010148

And this is phosgene bisphenola is taken in the aqua sodium hydroxide solution and phosgene is passed through a organic solvent , in this case say methylene chlorideforming BPA PC or bisphenola poly carbonate .	2.579749350300723

Now , what is the mechanism , you have BPA bisphenol a present in the aqua solutions of sodium hydroxide , so you have phenolate salt .	3.32339645675401

Now , what is what is the problem here the only one thing to consider that this is a water soluble monomer , this bisphenola in a sodium hydroxide solution and this phosgene is formed through the organic medium in this case methylene chloride .	3.2950899587777234

So , when this is formed this is a methylene chloride soluble species , so this will stay in the methylene chloride solution .	3.725161760261128

To react , now if you what to if you what this to react with the bisphenola phenolate ion to form a poly carbonate species , this has to migrate to the interface , this is currently now in the organic phase and this is in the aqueous phase .	3.6831614033292825

So , the reaction the chances of reacting of this two species is low , the chances of this species reacting with this species is low .	3.827045198165547

So , this is a very slow reaction , if you do the reaction in this way this will give you a very slow reaction .	5.2374765064589175

So , what is done to tackle this problem a tri a amine is added in the organic medium , say triethylamine or trimethylamine and when this reacts with this species it is form a salt now this is water soluble .	2.5401734779323193

So , now , you have a water soluble species , again this is water soluble .	5.729902423468568

So , now , they can do reaction in the water side of the interface , so the reaction become faster .	4.136613289263087

So , you have to add this amine catalyst to facilitate the reaction and have the reaction happening in first way , no first space .	3.1230756684152716

The same thing you can do if you what to keep this in the organic medium you can add a phase transfer catalyst in the water side , which will then complex with this bisphenol a salt and bring it closer to the organic medium .	3.227082130194857

So , then the reaction of this two reacting species will be happening in the organic side of the interface .	5.080873509829231

So , either you can add trimethylamine to bring this species to closer to water side or you can add a phase transfer catalyst to bring this bisphenol a ion to the organic side to make the reaction faster .	2.7338244643454375

Bisphenol a poly carbonate is having this commercial trade names , I will be giving all this you know some of the trade names of this polymers in the next few slides as well .	3.23048271368433

Now , because reaction is very fast you saw the rate constant of the reaction is very high .	5.997562246785918

So , you do not need not to maintain a stoichiometry of say very close to one is to one like the other linear poly condensation reaction here .	2.9043552143660603

Because , the stoichiometry are the interface is always maintained at one is to one , because reaction is not happening in the valve phase of the two monomers it is happening only at the interface and because reaction happening one is to one .	2.784945592332418

So , the stoichiometry at the reaction side , which is the interface is always maintained at one is to one .	3.2559290630578945

So , you do not need make a effort to maintain the stoichiometry of the two monomers close to one is to one .	3.182499213493089

Now , the reaction is fast , so the when the monomer defuse to the interface immediately it find a chain end reactive chain end and in reacts before even can approach to the other monomer , which means that this unlike this linear poly condensation reaction , which talked about it happens in a kinetic control way and it is very fast .	2.913316044857862

So , what is the outcome that molecular build up is much easier , because the as soon as the monomers defuse from the bulk to interface it reacts with the chain end and the chain grows one after one .	3.1546425191089194

And in other case normal linear poly condensation case you have dimmer , trimer , tetramer and it go slowly one after one , but in this case the monomers comes by diffusion to the interface reacts with the chain end .	2.8811449803222717

So , the chain grows in size , so it is very you know it is comparatively much easier to build molecular weight .	3.951091858891587

And as the reactions are happening or the monomers is getting added at the end of the chain , high molecular weight even possible at low conversion .	3.952981803564245

Unlike the normal poly condensation or step polymerization process .	4.078007079071041

And because the diffusion is slower compared to the actual reaction , polymerization reaction this reaction this polymerization reaction are often diffusion controlled .	3.9268743596511446

So , what are the requirements for a successful inter polymerization interfacial polymerization you need to have a inorganic base , which you require to neutralize the produce HCl otherwise HCl with go back and hydrolyze the salt .	2.656008331024189

In this case the example I showed you polycarbonate the sodium hydroxide was present to neutralize the HCl byproduct .	2.755169251534898

And the other way also you should restrict or minimize the acid chloride hydrolysis , because if it hydrolyze and form a plane alcohol , then it will just acid chloride if it hydrolyze to form simple acid carboxylic acid .	2.670354951783159

Then the reactivity will come down the reaction rate will be much lower and it will not happen it will not take place in the temperature we are working .	5.638889930941574

Proper choice of solvent , you must be taken and you need , because this reaction is happening interface .	4.530357995180166

So , if you start well you can generate more and more interface and by doing by generating more and more interface you can make the reaction the polymerization reaction faster .	3.9540829582382355

So , what are the disadvantage in spite of all this advantages , this is not this interfacial polymerization are not practiced very frequently commercially , so there must be some disadvantages .	3.228893329612307

And the main disadvantages are that the acid chloride acid chlorides are very costly .	2.930360044738338

So , you know increasingly people are trying to avoid this root simply to avoid this use of large amount of organic solvent , which are not environmentally friendly .	2.8580068408096557

Now , also polymers if you with it is presented in a solution most and most commonly in the organic solvent .	2.930319517029252

So , you need to take out the polymerization by precipitation for example , in poly carbonate case the poly carbonate are solvable in the methylene chloride phase .	2.897650819404392

So , there are always chances of having more impurities , compared to if you are doing in a bulk condition or a in a solution pure solution and also it is a batch process it is very difficult to do it continuously and as this reaction is kinetically controlled .	3.4765474695779877

So , this byproduct as the byproduct HCl is not taking part in the reverse reaction , so this reaction is kinetically controlled .	3.241128949088037

The chances of forming cyclics are much more , because cyclics are not reacting with the byproduct and forming the linear product once again , which means once cyclics forms it will remain in the final product .	2.7414950182309177

So , chances of having more cyclics are more in this interfacial polymerization .	3.3328831232759577

So , now we move to the different polymers , in coming few slides I just wanted to give you the standard synthetic process of the common commercial step polymers .	3.0011458616183773

Starting from polyester this is not exclusive least of polymers or it is not the detailed synthetic process or all the processes , which are utilized commercially .	3.7040684573827427

I just wanted to give you a brief idea of different types of step polymers and how they are synthesized commercially , just in a very brief .	4.4321817070263005

We will start with polyester and just example we will take is the most important and most used polyester poly ethylene terephthalate .	3.2321684433676237

This is the structure we have been showing you many times , these are several ways you can see synthesis PET Poly Esters Terephthalate , you can do take a ethylene ethylene glycol and diacid terephthalate acid .	2.9353451619463846

And direct reaction you can take instead of terephthalate acid you can take dimethyl ester of terephthalate acid you can take acid chloride and acid an hydride and so on an hydride and so on .	2.918227771162259

So , you may require high temperature , so this are typical not used commercially this two reactions are not used commercially .	3.246746221189388

This case is by ester exchange it can be done either starting from dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid or from terephthalic acid itself .	3.002524332723003

It is a two stage ester exchange process , first stage dimethyl terephthalicd M T is reacted with excess of ethylene glycol at say around moderate temperature and methanol is distilled out to form this compound .	2.180781252087936

And then these are now heated to a much higher temperature and the ethylene glycol is distilled out from the reaction .	3.9520261224185687

So , between two of this molecules exchange ester exchange happen and as you take out this ethylene glycol from the system polymerization medium the polymer start growing slowly this is the .	3.6115818327541493

And another way of making the PET is instead of taking dimethyl terephthalate , you can start with terephthalicacid and make first this an then follow the same process .	2.639028552692316

So , this is the most this is the commercial root of synthesis poly and these are the names trade names , which under which under which this poly ethylene terephthalate are sold in the market .	2.9631397236857224

We will move to the next class of polymers step polymers polyamides and we have this is linear poly polymerization reactions this is aliphatic diamine with aliphatic diacid you can directly under go reaction to form linear polyamide .	2.6653762654514135

And this is you know it is known as nylon 6 6 and this is very common polymers starting from hexamethylene diamine and adipic acids .	3.5438879775209484

Now , in last slide we saw aliphatic diamine and aliphatic diacids , now we want to move to the aliphatic diamines and aliphatic diester or diacid chloride in this case .	2.703581192479991

And these this polyamides are completely formed from aromatic groups containing aromatic groups .	2.77982546106962

So , these are aromatic polyamides and commonly known as aramid polymers and because the reactivity of this nitrogen attach to the aromatic ring is much less compared to if it as a simple aliphatic aliphatic aliphatic group .	2.6847694900044687

In this case we cannot simply do the polymerization reaction with diamine and diacids you require much reactive component functional group .	2.9811999863372014

So , typically in case of aromatic polyamide synthesis , aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic diacid chloride and you get this completely aromatic polyamides .	3.2395675505829

Instead of you can use the para substituted diamine with para substitute diacids to form this linear polyamides aromatic polyamides .	2.852846752966742

And this is known as kepler as a trade name and this is nomex and these are both nomex and kepler have very high melting points .	3.4202677956443455

So , these are very high polymers which are high very high performance polymers we move to next say we have just given generic example of branching and cross linking in last lecture .	3.257439005641887

Here , we I show you a definite examples you have ethyl an hydride here and we have a glycerol , when it reacts in this to reacts it form a linear chain along with a branch coming from this hydroxyl group .	2.7187423914052937

So , this is how you can carry out a there is a one example of forming bunch you know synthesis bunch polyester .	3.5831822704538006

Move to the next one which is cross link polyester in this case one example can be taken is a maleic anhydride reaction with ethylene glycol ; and once it forms the polymerization is complete at the end you have a double bond in the polyester back bone .	3.7458067769669667

So , you have synthesized in this way a unsaturated polyester .	4.724150866081143

Now , this double bond are available to react radically or some other chain polymerization mechanism by itself alone , are you can add a another monomers like styrene or MMA methyl methacrylate and then copolymerized with and form a cross link .	2.926117289640608

So , here you first make a step polymers , by step polymerization mechanism you make a unsaturated polyester , and then by doing a chain reaction you can do a cross linking reaction to form a cross linking reaction .	3.755990275073451

These are typically you know , these are available in the fatty acid there are lots of fatty acid which are which can be unsaturated available where you have a unsaturation or double bond in a other side not necessary end , but other side .	2.9274585170409617

Now , this double bond is free to undergo chain polymerization .	4.504024387371586

So , you can first stage you do a step polymerize to syntheses this and then you can take this and do a second step of chain polymerization either by oxidizing this or no using the other methods .	3.112698344492577

So , you can cross link this polyester unsaturated polyester chains , so by doing this we can make a cross linked network .	3.294321854001234

Next set of polymers we go is polysulfones and polyketones the generic structure is this its similar to the bisphenol astructure is polycarbonate X is , but in this case X is allied instead of H and Y is either a carbonyl or SO 2 group .	2.3691083445513246

Now , typically this aromatic halides are not very reactive towards a nucleophilic substitution reaction , but because you have a strong electron withdrawing group present here CO or CO 2 , CO or SO 2 this becomes more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution .	2.75174567742946

So , you can carry out the reaction with this the salt of phenolate phenolate ion and you can make a polymers like linked this .	3.4782298675905996

So , this is poly ether ether ketone , this is polyether ketone , this is poly bisphenol a polyether sulfone and this is simply called polyether sulfone .	2.694915209402884

They are partially crystalline this PEEK and PEK poly ether ether ketone and polyether ketone they are partially crystalline polymers they have a T g around this range and they have a very high melting point .	2.9805741146957874

So , they are they are again very high performance high performing polymers , which are used at very high temperature applications ; and they can be used in a applications where the constant temperature is say around as high as 240 to 280 degree .	3.3487636721929372

So , they are very you know high performing polymers this poly sulfonesor polyether sulfones , they are amorphous in nature the T g is around one they are also very high T g 180 to 230 and they have continuous use temperature is between 150 to 200 .	2.764906178722015

So , they also used in applications where string and link requirement for high temperature .	3.043879786119138

Next set we move to poly aromatic polyimides , these are formed by reaction with diamine with dianhydridedi , an aromatic dianhydrideso aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic dianhydrides , And first this is formed then one cyclization this is this imides are formed these are again very high performing polymers they are used for applications requiring very high temperature and they are known in under the trade name of captain and .	2.4630035267282975

There are also amorphous T g is very high and their continuous use temperature is 300 to 350 degree centigrade temperature .	3.791700489911527

Now , you can always go through any detailed publications or in a detailed text book where you will find out the detail you know detail method of making this polymers .	2.871874168871233

But just for this course I am just giving you a over view of this different step polymer and just generic method of synthesizing this .	2.8133093439772967

So , we move to polyether imides again this is the process of making polyether imides and these are again very high heat polymers ; that means , this having very capability of you know they can be used in very high temperature .	3.5134548340522307

They are known in the trade name of ultem , there amorphous T g is as high as 215 degree centigrade and there are constant use temperature is between 18 170 to 180 .	3.166001696243205

So , in the if the application required that you the polymer will should be present at this high temperature .	3.350583726574708

This is another example another set of polymers is polyamide imides you take this aromatic diamines with one side poly anhydride and the carbo oxalic acid silica acids to form this amide polyamide imides .	2.391601441028438

And this is sold as a trade name as turlon , this is also very high heat polymer , this is also amorphous T g having 270 to 285 and the constant use temperature is 220 to 235 .	2.8204142842225086

So , there are this is just a to mention that there are other step polymers as well listed in this slide .	3.8545967895545252

And which you can go through any text book or any standard publications to find out , if you are interested how they are synthesized and what are their property you know basic property .	3.5075059238226927

So , what I wanted to do next to just give you idea about step copolymers , now if you have say a amino acid R COH and NS 2 R double dash COH .	2.6143785870315805

Now , obliviously it will form , now why do we put the bracket will be always next to each other should I put the bracket here and put N like this , it may not be it could be somewhere here and there could be another bracket here .	3.1788151570776164

So , these is one example of making copolymers in step by step polymerization method you take say a by functional monomers A B type .	2.7549605777214667

And if you have two different group in side then you can make a copolymer , but this has not very regularly used method from making copolymer , if you the practiced methods are normally if you say , if you are making a polyester , if you have say CH 2 CH 2 OH ethylene glycol .	3.0668324843239922

Now , if you have this along with plus if you have say terephthalic acid in the other side .	4.2997500735097045

Now , you have to make the total of these total of this diol with the ratio of this thing is close to one is to one .	3.562587421014281

So , total number of functional group of OH group is almost close to the number of groups of COH group , so that the polymers take place .	4.2413514564624935

Now , in this case you make a copolymer , which have this poly ethylene terephthalic unit and also have a polybutylene terephthalate unit .	3.6417449351284876

So , this a example of copolymers of PET and PBT polyethylene terephthalate copolybutylene terephthalate depending upon the ratio of these two you know which in which one will be higher or not .	3.343060342198359

Now , what do you except when you make this copolymer will there be alternative copolymer , that mean will you have this ethylene glycol group .	3.0539787711023774

And butylene glycol group butylene glycol group always next to each other will we expect that or will you expect that there be will random copolymers .	2.6557310790114492

Now , if you normal in the normal step polymerization reaction , because this goes through a thermodynamically control process .	3.019248232350198

That means , the byproducts also take part in the reverse reaction and the chains intermediate chains also take part reactions with exchange reaction between them .	3.0755010166694623

So , they reshuffle all the time you know during entire reaction there always reshuffling happening between the chains .	3.197923748409129

So , there is a transfer happening between the extraction is happening between two groups , which means that if the reaction proceed through thermo dynamical control , if the reaction is thermodynamically control controlled .	3.42932120183287

Then you will always land up in a completely random copolymer , you understand why , because this reaction when they are happening there is slow reaction .	3.027631565822693

So , during the reaction time the byproducts also taking part in the reverse reaction and also the intermediate chains they are also reacting with each other by exchange ester exchange .	3.6278043416727845

And by doing , so they are always reshuffling between them self at the end you always have a completely random copolymer .	3.6168318836680555

Now , if you are doing the other reaction say for example , if I go back to the polycarbonate example in this case , if I instead of taking this BPA .	4.179663143543636

If I take this BPA and bisphenol a and also some other di hydroxyl group say something else some substituted group here , instead of methyl we have ethyl group or some other group .	2.351352790454013

And you have taken that is one is to one and you are heating with phosgene .	4.911226136413183

Now , in this case reaction is kinetically controlled , which means once the polymer all as a matter of cyclics we just talked about few minutes back .	2.978293008943456

Once they are formed they are not taking part in the reshuffling reaction or reaction with the byproduct reverse reaction with the byproduct .	3.7181834850217457

Because , they very fast reaction once the product is formed the byproduct HCl is getting neutralized with sodium hydroxide , which means there is one reaction is formed .	2.9103841383472377

They are not taking part in the reshuffling reactions which means the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of this group .	3.879634235041846

Unlike the earlier case say butylene glycol and ethylene glycol even if there are were any differences in the activity between two hydroxide groups .	3.1991167473224316

Ultimately at the beginning even if they are making blocky copolymers at the end by doing reshuffling finally , you would land up in a random copolymer .	3.5799504336237424

But in this case , the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of the functional group if this functional group is same having same reactivity with the other functional group then it will form a random copolymer .	3.7967533486947596

If they are different , then the most react in a more reactive group would react faster forming a block , then the second monomer would react forming a another block .	2.760778040638

So , in this case because it is a kinetically controlled fast reaction reactivity of the reacting monomers would determine , whether its form a random copolymer or a or a block a copolymer .	3.0392335262759853

So , you understand the terminally controlled polymers would give always a statistically random copolymer whether whereas , in kinetically controlled polymerization reaction .	2.29198886627583

The nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of the functional groups of the monomers , if there are significant difference in the reactivity of the functional groups among the comonomers .	4.168510014784053

Then there will be blocky nature , in the copolymer resulting copolymers , if there is no reactivity difference then there is no .	4.916430012990234

And you have to consider what is the diffusivity ?	8.658897431113779

You know reactivity coupled with the reactivity if some monomers is diffusing first at the interface it will react faster .	2.8362625037054734

So , when I talking about the reactivity it would also include the diffusivity diffusivity aspect of the monomers is well .	3.8185454601340334

So , if the if the reaction between the one monomer with the phosgene is faster , then it will be a blocky copolymer .	4.0398531935118

So , we have come to the end of this module and what we will do now , I want to tell my expectation you know what are the learning objective in this module in the step growth polymerization ; now what I expect from a student after going through this module .	2.882262808225125

Let us , go one by one I expect that a student after going through this module should understand the mechanistic differences between step and chain copolymers , chain polymerization should which polymerization , so it should be polymerization .	2.305941650451974

So , I expect that a student should understand the mechanistic difference between chain and step polymerization , if I stop a reaction after some conversion , what you expect in the polymerization medium , how the molecular weight build up with time and so on .	2.7769756080659844

What are the functional groups you require for a step polymers or a chain polymers , so on .	4.4885745291209895

If I give you a structure of the of the polymer synthetic polymer , then you should be able to identify by which process it has been synthesized , whether it is a step polymers polymerization process or a chain polymerization process .	4.309212598538333

Just by looking at the structure you should be able to tell or you should be able to identify , what is the difference you know in which method by which method it has been synthesized .	3.6949824420883206

You should know the relationship between X n bar the number average degree of polymerization with r the stoichiometry ratio and p the conversion in a normal step polymerization process .	3.377161821786502

And you know by then this car others equation and you also should appreciate that the fact to make high polymer high molecular weight polymer you should have p value close to one .	2.869299272362424

So , you should push the reaction as much as possible and also if you want to build a high molecular weight polymer your r should be close to 1 .	3.138709029267059

And I have given few example during my lectures you should be able to calculate the M n there the number average molecular weight from X n the degree number average degrees of polymers .	3.230925753966961

And so as M W from X w you know number average with weight average molecular weight from , weight average degree of polymerization .	2.790269924508166

If you want to control the molecular weight , if have want some reason you want to target some molecular weight with both the ends having some particular functional group or no functional group .	3.317426443073147

And if you at the end to the polymer if you do not want to have any reactive functional group , then you should use mono functional chain stoppers and your molecular weight , when you use a chain stoppers , what is your target molecular weight you know the calculation hence you should be knowing the calculation .	3.480999007434301

From the kinetics of step polymerization you should understand that you know to achieve high conversion and as a result high molecular weight .	3.8675047951176484

And you must continue the reaction for long time , because the kinetics is lower and also is always preferred is always preferable to have a high equilibrium constant , which will depend upon the reactive .	3.373834526905456

So , if you design you can design highly reactive monomers , then they will have naturally high equilibrium constant .	3.1144207120391965

So , it will be easier for you to make high molecular even if you cannot remove the small molecular weight byproduct completely or quantity from the reaction medium .	3.2931474013232997

And he also should know that why in reality PDI always end up being slightly higher than two because of side reaction cyclization .	2.6166773911827845

And the same time he should or she should know , what are the ways you can minimize the cycling formation in a step polymerization .	3.049635605458449

And a student should know the condition and you know what are the what are the conditions you know what are the monomers to be used if you what a branching or cross linking .	3.8436169681132917

And if you do not what are the monomers you should not use for branching and you should also know the utility , if you what sometimes it is undesired to have branching in the polymer .	3.1627861647310582

And sometimes it is deliberately you know wanted it is deliberate somebody , who will deliberately want to include want the branching or cross linking in the polymers .	2.3975086474278813

So , what are the ways you can do that or what are the ways you can have avoid that and what are the utilities or the problem if a student being .	3.694075983683135

So , if you what to work in the lab or if you join in the industry you should be able to know what are the complete list of criteria , you know we have gone in last lecture to carry out a successful step polymerization .	3.284894777082966

And in case following all the normal process normal directions , if you do not build high molecule weight what are the first things to look for , what are the common trouble shooting ?	3.101354004395429

You should first look for that also you should by know and have a graphs in by this time .	2.9220154998700214

And in also know different what are the common step polymers , what are their property and what are the different ways of making step polymers , same polymers can be making different ways .	3.078962301889694

And one including what is the fundamental differences in interfacial polymerization they utilize the very first reaction of diacylchloride or diacylchloride .	3.070250782353391

And what are the mechanism and what are the problem in interfacial polymerization .	6.444507125742753

And finally , different commercial polymers you know student have a idea at least you should not I do not expect that a master of all the polymers , step polymers there as many step polymers .	2.695152153361691

At least I have some idea that these are the polymers are made by synthesized by step polymerization mechanism and one the most common ways of synthesized I have given examples in today ’ s lecture for quite a few .	3.442633972855492

And I also did not I could not include several others .	3.1820965193307718

So , I would expect that which are not covered in this in this lecture you please read the book or any other text to go through the common synthetic method for those polymers as well .	3.100723596309041

And you should be knowing the polymers , which I have covered in today ’ s lecture .	4.716254139549881

So , with this I conclude this module on step growth polymers and polymers and polymerization step growth polymerization mechanism .	3.725249697747217

Hello !	124.54901105960549

Today we will be talking about immobilized enzymes .	4.75498905057376

So far we have seen the structure and function of enzymes as they are available in the living cells .	4.4876851420179

We have also seen that functionally they are very efficient catalysts in the sense that they provide a very high degree of specificity , a very high degree of turn over number as far as their function is concerned .	3.1701447115685886

But the fact is that these catalysts have not found such a wide spread use as far as industry is concerned excepting in some conventional applications in foods or pharmaceuticals which are the natural processing agent in the case of industrial applications .	2.461358967921448

Bulk of the other industries has not made use of these biocatalysts at least up to the beginning of the last two decades .	3.2241654883957054

The major limitation , you also noticed during our understanding of the structure - function relationship of the enzyme , is that they are usually very unstable and that probably is one of the major limitations as far as enzymes are concerned with respect to their application .	3.5864488858646695

They cannot be used conventionally in organic solvent .	5.313306219034349

That is the perception that means their structural confirmation in which they are catalytically active is functional only in aqueous medium .	2.5825326251005483

Their activity or their function in the normal temperature range also put sometimes a disadvantageous situation in the sense that at those temperatures many of the microbial activities are also optimum and therefore they lead to contamination of products and therefore their industrial application becomes restricted .	2.365226264149059

Also a major factor in the limitations of the application of soluble enzymes in industry has also been the soluble nature of enzymes that means they have to be used in water soluble form .	3.6094289830882342

When we have to use them in water soluble form it only means that the process has to be in the batch mode .	4.668138929808681

That means you take an enzyme solution or a substrate solution , add a quantity of soluble enzyme in a batch mode , provide the optimum temperature and pH , carry out the reaction and terminate the reaction by changing one of the operational parameter either by heating it or by drastic change of pH so that the reaction is terminated and then extract the product .	3.2339633706306796

In this whole process the major problem is that one has to discard the enzyme , one has to deactivate the enzyme and the enzyme is usually not possible to be recovered at the end of the process .	3.9856355511935315

Because recovering the enzyme from reaction mixture will be as difficult or as tedious if not more as production of the original enzyme itself and in most cases enzyme being produced by living systems are usually expensive commodities and therefore their deactivation at the end of one batch operation is not a desirable feature and that has been a major limitation .	2.7208426028425925

The two issues of unstability and possibility of their use repeatedly or in a continuous mode has been the major driving force of looking at immobilization as an approach to provide a vector platform for the use of enzyme in industrial application .	2.515358304478333

A major question that will come is what do we mean by immobilization ?	3.3442696866660193

What is immobilization ?	12.214988925574968

If you look at for a very broad based and operational definition of immobilization we can say that enzymes are physically confined or localized in a defined region of a space .	2.65656380549779

The enzymes that are physically confined or localized in a defined region of a space with retention of their catalytic activity and which can be used repeatedly or continuously in a process are usually considered as the immobilization enzyme preparations .	2.525759135323966

This is basically an operational definition .	5.263582187916047

I like you to concentrate on at least three major phrases built in , in this definition .	2.844368543580202

One is physically confined or localized in a defined region of space .	2.9249028515223663

That means the enzyme molecule which is homogenously suspended in a soluble preparation has to be then localized in a narrow region of space and this is no longer uniformly , homogenously distributed in a reaction mixture .	3.4366440924202792

An analogy can be made to a heterogeneous catalysis .	4.60307912535234

In the case of chemical catalysis many of the catalyst are used in a heterogeneous phase , while the use of soluble enzyme will provide a homogenous catalysis .	3.7643215598028807

That means the distribution or composition of every species in the reaction mixture whether it is catalyst or a substrate or a product is uniform throughout the reaction mixture .	3.378256032927587

The use of immobilization enzymes will lead to a heterogeneous catalysis .	4.5169598016286505

That means while substrate and the product might be homogenously distributed the enzyme will be localized in some area of the space .	3.475677958950569

It will not be homogenously distributed at every point in the reaction mixture .	4.261651291424866

The second phrase which is very important is the retention of their catalytic activity .	3.980150268562754

That means if you do any modification so as to arrive at an immobilization enzyme preparation it should require the retention of their catalytic activity .	2.9711855979442987

Otherwise it doesn ’ t have any meaning to have immobilized enzyme preparation .	4.3680037520318

At the end of the immobilization enzyme preparation retention of catalytic activity is a major requirement .	3.8108977085744073

Retention of catalytic activity is a very relative term .	5.988630277435741

Relative in the sense that hundred percent retention of catalytic activity at the end of any processing step is not feasible .	3.5057120203844914

So when we say retention of catalytic activity you are implying that a major fraction of the activity must be retained .	3.2793518820973246

The degree of retention will vary from enzyme to enzyme ; also the more unstable the enzyme the poor will be retention or method of immobilization ; more harsher the method that means if the enzyme is subjected to more harsh treatment in terms of pH , chemicals or temperature the inactivation may be more .	2.5820895444116188

Ultimately a major portion of enzyme activity must be retained .	4.388389219744209

If the enzyme activity leads to 0 or 5 % or 10 % at the end of the immobilization I don ’ t think we should logically call it an immobilization enzyme preparation .	3.066255393268123

The third issue and which is also operationally very important is which can be used repeatedly or continuously in a process.Ultimate objective of immobilization is to use it either repeatedly in a batch mode so that the same enzyme preparation is used in repeated batches one after another or it can be used in a continuous reactor like a plug flow reactor or a continuous stir tank reactor so that you can process some substrate over a long period of time using a same amount of enzyme and therefore decreasing the cost of enzyme per unit quantity of the product produced .	2.9334286183154514

The major objective , from the industrial point of view , of immobilization enzyme would be to reduce the cost of enzyme input into any processing per unit quantity of the product to a significant level and that is what is often achieved .	3.2020577449741356

This definition takes care of the three major factors one is the localization of the enzyme or connectivity over a major substrate and such an immobilization can be achieved by different means .	3.412377673387203

There are number of methods .	7.304268088704241

If you can couple an enzyme preparation to a matrix , an insoluble matrix , which is not soluble anyway couple whereas the enzyme activity is retained and this being an insoluble matrix , a particulate matrix , one can pack it into a column or one can use it in a stirred reactor and give a feed continuously and take all the product stream continuously .	2.8533891591928593

Both the things are feasible .	6.740997923126952

Alternatively instead of coupling to a matrix it could also be feasible that you entrap the enzyme into a matrix .	3.3564712705840507

For example you take a permeable micro capsule in which the enzyme molecule can be entrapped such that the enzyme molecules cannot come out but the substrate or the product can freely diffuse in and out and such a system will also be called immobilized system .	3.5145035868100623

A very extreme situation can be considered of immobilization where we are not really having a physical preparation in the immobilized form but if you use a soluble enzyme in a membrane reactor , a typical membrane reactor , and this is a ultra filtration reactor in which the enzyme molecules are put in and this membrane is able to restrict the flow of enzyme and you can put in the substrate here , the product can go out and the enzyme can be retained in the membrane reactor .	3.588723490857673

Let us say an ultra filtration cell in which the molecular weight cut off of the membrane is such that the enzyme is not allowed to pass through and retained as the retentate whereas the unconverted substrate and the product formed is passed through a membrane and can be collected .	3.436713287080167

In such a case also as a system we will call as an immobilized enzyme system although the preparation will no longer be immobilized in the physical form , in the form of like what we considered as the bound preparation or entrapped preparation but still functional because in such a system you can use the enzyme continuously or repeatedly without loosing in the product stream .	2.7986877990640577

We often consider that if you couple a soluble enzyme molecule on to a solid matrix whether it is an inorganic matrix or an organic matrix or a gel that is the conventional form of immobilization .	3.4264299910660774

Unconventionally one can also make all these conditions feasible that means you can localize the enzyme in a defined area of space that is in an ultra filtration cell .	3.364562084764104

I presume that you understand what ultra filtration cell is .	4.2265903492271315

You have a stern vessel in which at the bottom there is a membrane with a narrow molecular weight cut off .	3.1041329179945976

That means it will allow only substances below a certain molecular weight to pass through it .	3.2751352793858746

The molecules with higher molecular weight will be retained .	5.850876004542548

In such a reactor if you use an enzyme by putting substrate in and taking out the product which are low molecular weight compounds and enzyme being high molecular weight molecule will be retained in the reactor during use .	3.2097935153559707

Such systems also will be considered as immobilized enzyme systems .	6.366420999175902

In fact although industrially such systems are not very commonly employed as far as the academic study is concerned these systems have been applied .	2.9116439757939943

One of the early systems which were applied was way back in late sixties and early seventies to hydrolysis of cellulose and starch .	2.352251519871427

Because the starch product is low molecular weight glucose similarly cellular product is also glucose .	3.0790603366721343

This comes out of the product and the enzyme and the unconverted substrate remains in the retentate .	6.221326440917229

One limitation will be that the product has to be a low molecular product .	5.68055210317044

That ’ s why it has not industrially become very attractive .	3.663531830129787

There are problems still as far as the cost of the membrane is concerned the following operational problems .	3.621782099229033

There are still problems .	8.145082853687496

Today in the literature we will find probably a few thousand methods of immobilization and not that all of them have been commercially viable , because commercially viability is an issue which is linked directly to economics , the power of economics .	2.574770640136335

So it does not restrict to but what we are talking of the basic definition of immobilized enzyme that you can do it in that matter .	4.980911455829588

As a matter of fact this is an artificial cell as you can consider let us say living cell itself .	4.008640633551467

In living cell also the enzyme is entrapped through a semi permeable membrane which does not allow the enzyme molecules to pass through and some of the product molecules from the cell also are usually ripped off .	3.7155818069507642

The cell membrane is much more specific and has quiet distinct features compared to an ordinary ultra filtration cell which only functions based on molecular weight .	2.6452168046880984

The cell membrane has still more specific functions and more elaborate functions but here the function is only based on the molecular weight cut off .	3.121821070012956

The second point is that what are the major advantages or what are the major features and why should we immobilize enzymes ?	3.855976644586424

I would like to give you a brief about the historical perspectives .	4.510295440479884

The whole concept of immobilization of enzymes started sometime in mid sixties and not before that mainly for two reasons .	2.5302473130323553

One is that the scientist wanted to apply some of the enzymes for industrial processing and obviously for industrial processing you need certain operational advantages The major disadvantages in the case of the enzymes is the restriction in the best mode of processing , the stability , some of the physico chemical properties in respect of pH optimum , temperature optimum , substrate specificity and they could all be taken care for industrial processing .	2.796273268692026

The second motivating factor was many people also wanted to study the enzymes in their natural habitat or at least as close to the natural habitat .	2.8406604254717536

When we talk about the enzyme , structure and functional aspects , we are missing one thing that whatever studies have been made in those aspects they have been made after isolating the enzyme from a cell .	2.7946716441098425

If you notice the half life of an enzyme in a living cell you can make certain indirect calculations .	4.641035787106063

You can notice that in a living cell the enzyme is not as unstable as we notice it in the laboratory or pharmaceutical applications .	4.199632768323885

The turn over of the enzyme molecule itself in a living cell is quite low .	4.8566132693239235

The cell does not synthesize because protein synthesis in a living cell is quite an energy intensive process and cells often will like to economise the energy consumption as far the protein synthesis is concerned .	2.1716949487056363

Therefore the half life of the enzyme in the living cell , the stability is much higher compared to a free state .	5.498383400843058

If they can try to bring as close to the living environment and the process which they adopted was immobilization .	2.987229725145717

Because most of the enzymes which people understood very well were the membrane bound enzymes and they noticed that in the membrane bound enzyme there was some kind of a physical coupling between the enzyme and the insoluble membrane as a matrix .	3.044362538854474

Therefore they thought that coupling of an enzyme to an insoluble matrix would be a desirable feature to study enzymes or immobilized enzymes as a model system for natural enzymes and then one can really look into the various properties in terms of their operational properties , in terms of their kinetic properties and also in terms of their substrate specificity and other aspects .	2.8821065571160687

After isolation from the cell you are trying to bring back because you see when they are in a living cell you have no means to study them excepting indirect calculation that this might be happening and this is the rate of flux .	3.2760622147773524

In fact most of the metabolic pathways although we understand qualitatively much better but still the quantitative fluxes of the individual enzyme catalysed reactions in a metabolic pathway is still a very difficult aspect .	2.5262241076940195

So the only way out left to a scientist is that one isolates and tries to mimic the conditions of a cell so that one can probably try to interpret the functioning in a cell ; how it is happening and the immobilization provided isolation of the enzyme .	2.4055570766759518

You don ’ t keep it in a cell ; you isolate but then again revert back , kind of a pseudo cell for example you entrap that into a micro capsule which is continuous semi - permeable membrane or take a very fine porous film attach an enzyme molecule to this and then this mimics as much as probably your enzyme was supported on a membrane in the living cell and study its properties .	2.628254808919693

So they were the two motivations and when we talk about the operational advantages because of our major interest we will look at enzymes as an industrial catalyst for use in industrial reactors for conversion of substrates into products .	2.6441827496139925

The immobilization offers n number of advantages and one of the major advantages which we have already talked about in the definition itself is its reusability .	3.5104198116871936

That means the cost of the enzyme per unit product is significantly reduced by the reusability .	3.988498949091032

Instead of the possibility of using only in soluble mode in a batch reactor you can use in a variety of application modes .	4.134520287209468

A variety of reactor types can be used for carrying out the transformation or reactions instead of using only a batch stirred reactor as we can afford only for a soluble enzyme .	3.175922146158445

Another major advantage is the rapid termination of reaction .	3.7070877422993522

In the case of the soluble enzyme the only means of terminating a reaction is to deactivate the enzyme either by drastic change of pH , heating , boiling in a water bath or adding some kind of chemical , irreversible inhibitors of an enzyme , which can inactivate the enzyme .	2.6298545535079336

But in the case of immobilized enzyme you can repeatedly terminate by physically separating it .	3.391249896878671

Even if you use in a batch mode by physically filtering off the enzyme preparation , the reaction is stopped .	4.368711347378968

There is no enzyme present and the reaction is stopped .	5.9617908999062434

That gives you a very great operational significance and the use of an immobilized enzyme also leads to relatively purer product .	3.602626780963043

In the case of a batch mode the enzyme is going along a product stream and in some cases the discharge of proteins into the product stream may cause purification problems .	3.293306226656058

Therefore the use of immobilized preparation in those cases will lead to a much purer product or significant convenience as far as the downstream processing of the product stream is concerned .	3.4847859228352074

In fact many of the products which have been commercialized using immobilized enzyme preparations are for application in food and food constituents .	3.5629205156429338

In the case of food constituent we don ’ t want the enzyme protein to go as a product in the product stream .	3.2327237508111697

In the case of immobilized enzyme that problem is not there because the enzyme is already separated and the product stream as it is can be used as a food constituent directly in the product form .	3.847512737694401

In most cases the immobilization has also resulted in some altered physico - chemical properties .	3.1116164731251

When I say physico - chemical properties the most important properties probably for which enzymes are considered as poor candidates are their stability .	2.6221609595437676

In most cases the stability is enhanced and therefore it becomes a desirable feature .	3.9847569861664454

The other altered physico - chemical properties are optimum pH and specificity .	3.5055111148438014

In many cases the altered optimum pH will result only on the basis of the nature of the carrier you are using .	3.765561782162724

If it is an ionizable carrier , charged carrier then only it will lead to a change in optimum pH as we will see subsequently .	3.514463279801612

But specificity also has been a factor .	6.5241239824538795

In fact even one can have an altered km for an immobilized enzyme as compared to soluble enzyme which again depending upon the same feature as optimum pH that is the matrix is charged and the substrate is also charged where the partitioning effects , the apparent km might also change .	2.97768013995735

The third motivating factor was the use of the model system for natural enzymes that we discussed and which also has been a very significant reason for immobilizing enzymes .	3.330446177619909

Now let us look at the requirements of an immobilized system .	5.083116190675319

In fact any immobilized enzyme system has three major constituents , three major players The first player is the soluble enzyme .	2.758877458114478

We have to start with a good preparation of an enzyme isolated from a living system produced by fermentation or isolated from animals or plant cells .	2.7112884277607634

You need a soluble enzyme .	7.6275056808657276

The other is carrier .	8.284229251134974

You need a matrix to which the enzyme can be immobilized in general .	4.453542951800752

There might be some methods which may be carrier free .	4.2173570706975925

But in most cases , carrier is a candidate which is required for a coupling of soluble enzyme onto an insoluble matrix .	3.6624067677911505

The third player is in method of immobilization and the total performance of immobilized enzyme preparation will depend upon the combination of the interactions between these three players .	3.83574397411114

What are the properties we look at when we choose a soluble enzyme ?	3.8824732172314302

We understand that we require a particular reaction to be catalyzed .	5.191963610632571

So the enzyme is fixed .	11.542037172171147

For the sake of convenience let us assume that we have to isomerise glucose to fructose with enzyme called glucose isomerase .	3.1993384519736097

When we talk of the enzyme for immobilization if we want to …. .. immobilized enzyme preparation what properties are important for choosing the enzyme source ?	3.894214617605446

The major factor is that we will look for an enzyme preparation which has the high specific activity .	5.177231926743491

That means per unit weight of the protein its activity is much higher .	4.7140982895358645

This will depend upon two factors one is the source of the enzyme and the purity of the enzyme .	5.264811253295763

Purer the enzyme , the better for immobilization because you can have a very highly active immobilized enzyme preparation or the source will also be important , if you can choose a source which gives you an enzyme which has a much higher specific activity .	4.394931173473965

That means processing cost can be much lesser that is you have to put a much lesser protein for achieving the same catalytic function .	2.888302699084538

One of the major constraints of operational parameters is for many processes the operational parameters required for an enzymatic catalysis should not induce any side reactions .	2.372609836435812

In addition to catalytic function by glucose enzyme , this process of glucose isomerisation can also take place in the presence of an alkali .	3.283323817459828

In such case if you can have an enzyme preparation which has either a neutral or a slightly acidic pH optimum it is desirable .	3.8535750546996383

In fact the immobilized enzyme preparation can be tailored so as to have at least minor adjustment of the operational parameters .	3.856754144236791

The third factor is stability .	6.035851115592143

In the light of specific activity , only your specific activity , again this will also depend on source of the enzyme .	3.0522526739442766

One needs to choose the enzyme and its further processing for purification so as to have the three properties which are in the positive region and we choose the soluble enzymes on that basis .	3.043956489787223

The second candidate in the case of immobilized enzyme is carriers .	5.35978877153472

In terms of the total gross weight of the product for example if you look at the total immobilized enzyme preparation almost ninety nine points will be contributed by a carrier .	4.300571567029916

In one gram of immobilized enzyme , the enzyme preparation will be probably only a fraction of milligrams or if not more than one or two milligrams .	3.8991037879591484

Bulk of the immobilization enzyme product will be in the form of carrier .	5.305123979034234

We are taking a water insoluble carrier .	5.314029781312215

One of the key parameter here is it has to be insoluble in reaction environment .	4.412803905996054

I am using a general term reaction environment mainly because while most of the reactions are to be carried out in aqueous medium today there are requirements that many of the reactions may be carried out in organic non - polar medium .	3.353243250540638

Therefore the carrier which we choose should be insoluble in the reaction environment and that is a major requirement .	4.559384474217848

It may ultimately depend upon the chemical composition of the carrier .	5.736302969887194

Logically the carrier should also be non - toxic to the enzymatic reaction and this should not act as an inhibitor or some kind of an irreversible inhibitor to the enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.541329120406353

Another very important feature is resistance to microbial , thermal or mechanical degradation because as you recall right in our definition we mentioned that it is required to be used over a long period of time .	2.8977533042754664

The use over a long period of time may involve many features which might expose the whole material to many features which may lead to microbial degradation , thermal degradation or mechanical degradation and the carrier should be resistant to them .	2.4161347874441446

Therefore carrier itself should be very stable otherwise the stability of the enzyme will not have much of meaning .	4.117647445972219

The carrier should also have a large number of sites for binding of enzyme .	4.313365515033315

The major reason is that ultimately the objective of an immobilized enzyme system will be to have a very high activity .	4.472454480478676

To have a high functional reactivity one need as much of enzyme .	3.374291744374723

The activity or the loading of the enzyme on to the carrier must be very high , the higher you can make and that will require a large number of sites for binding of the enzyme on to the carrier .	4.378327559876346

This will require many of the functional groups to be present on the carrier .	6.113042259467962

It will also depend on the porosity on the carrier .	5.153152286568076

The porosity of the carrier depends on the surface area which will also result from the porosity as well as the particle size .	4.7666052088135675

So surface area will also become quite important .	4.295285042820883

Finally if not a major scientific fact but at least the economic feature is the regenerability and cost .	2.9483944321097075

Another criterion which plays a very key role into the carrier matrix .	3.7420701267817447

Normally we will prefer a carrier which is not very expensive .	6.18808739942052

In an inexpensive carrier one may say that you may not be able to meet the other desirable properties .	3.6021848079485514

One can choose an expensive carrier provided the carrier can be regenerated at the end of the exhaustion of the enzyme .	3.2501809766059817

When I say immobilized enzyme should be used continuously or repeatedly again this means that it can be used for couple of days , couple of months , couple of years and not for ever .	2.597539530188577

In fact you will notice that in some of the industrially used immobilized enzyme preparations the low cost carriers has been rejected mainly because of some of the undesirable properties that they cannot get you a very high enzyme loading on them and many of the expensive carriers have been used but only under the condition that they can be regenerated .	3.2343461321643567

Carriers like organic ion exchange resins like D I cellulose and di Sephadex have been extensively used for immobilization of enzyme by absorption and after use when the whole enzyme is desorbed the carrier is again available for reuse .	2.3747240990450047

To take care of all these desirable features of carrier the properties that you look in a carrier are chemical composition , specific surface area that means surface area per unit weight of the carrier , particle size and ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups mainly to achieve a very high degree of loading because one has to choose all the functional group of the enzyme molecule for coupling and therefore hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups on the carrier and finally the cost .	2.699026037180291

These are the four general features of properties one has to look in the carriers .	3.9086128913001925

Large varieties of carriers have been used and are available for use fortunately and these carriers have been classified by various people in different modes , in different forms .	2.6894991622952342

A very generalized scientific approach to classify them will be on the basis of their porosity .	3.4929324569209497

Porosity is the basis for classification of carriers .	4.665041694059707

That is they can be non - porous .	7.552328020837224

The non - porous carriers will have a low specific surface area because the porous matrix will provide lot of internal surface in a matrix .	2.715221999071989

The only surface which is available is the external surface , only part .	4.0183584193297115

To get a higher surface area you have to reduce the particle size which also has a great limitation of use because of the smaller the particle size its use in a packed …… is difficult because of the high pressure drops .	3.922458529127019

Its use in CSTR is difficult mainly because of its loss through the product stream if it is too fine a particle .	3.907977094268668

Therefore non - porous matrices usually have a limitation of low surface area .	3.3168691464668574

As far as the chemical composition , ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic group or the cost is concerned it is a general feature .	4.1321662860425805

Non - porous matrix also has an advantage .	5.5105482666599555

Mainly they have been used extensively for bio medical applications where an additional desirable feature other than the ones we mentioned in the carriers is the prevention of interfacial immunological responses in the bio - medical system .	2.5520889040815677

For example when you want to use an immobilized enzyme preparation for any bio - medical application it will interact with the blood stream and any external material in contact with the blood stream will generate a very vigorous immunological response and it has been noted that the non - porous matrices or the non - porous materials are much softer as far as these responses are concerned compared to porous ones .	2.5514513651223885

The typical example of the use of the non - porous matrix in the bio - medical application has been nylon as a non - porous matrix which has been used to immobilize some of the therapeutic enzymes for use in contact with the blood stream .	3.6948372750466367

The other group of matrices is porous matrices , the most preferred kind of material that are used for industrial applications and these matrices are control pore glass , control pore titanium and variety of other synthetic tailored materials which have been produced commercially for generating a high porosity for coupling of enzymes on them .	2.2304930912312635

The third kind of material is gel structure .	4.377235662401379

They are porous in nature but they are usually flexible in the pore size or thermoelastic and the pore is flexible and the typical examples which have been used are collagen , poly acrylamide , gelatin and a large number of other gel structures have been used .	2.914348259049136

In the gel structure you can entrap the enzyme in the gel matrices and the advantage is that the enzyme can experience almost the same kind of water activity or the environment as very close to what is obtained in the case of a living cell .	3.222105020911633

Let us consider the gel matrix and the enzyme entrapped in the lattices .	4.568620871051756

The gel will not allow the enzyme to pass through but the small molecular weight substrate and product can easily be allowed to get in or come out .	3.327994603711716

Another way of classifying the carriers will be on the basis of chemical nature .	3.7854412492019476

One can have either inorganic carriers or organic carriers .	3.951690947335221

In most cases the inorganic carriers as I mentioned are the whole range of control pore glass , control pore titanium many of the clays which are naturally occurring like bentonite , animal charcoal and things like that fall under inorganic but the organic carriers are usually polysaccharides , proteins and synthetic polymers .	2.2443725406760304

Typical example of organic carriers are polysaccharides , cellulose , agarose , even cross linked dextran what we call industrially as sephadex .	2.6802901550704963

This is nothing else but cross linked dextran molecules .	4.023288632535811

Then in the case of proteins almost like what we talked about gel structure , collagen and gelatin are typical examples and there is a whole range of synthetic polymers which have been reported and used for immobilizing enzymes which are usually polystyrene based , vinyl polymers , polyacrylamide and so on.You can classify and a large variety of carriers are available for use for immobilizing enzymes and the choice will depend upon various properties that we have listed .	3.223113252593006

So , welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and in this lecture today we are continuing our discussion which is left over from last lecture on frictional properties of polymer in dilute solution .	2.7713286329455586

And then we will begin the important discussion on polymer characterization which is basically how to determine polymer molecular weight .	3.5153527748777127

We plan to give just an overview of the techniques which can be used for a polymer determination of polymer molecular weight today .	3.5859319000587293

And if time permits we will continue and discuss the method of dilute solution viscometry by which we can determine viscosity average molecular weight .	3.340931160324499

Now let us continue the discussion we are having in last lecture .	3.136211856430376

Now as we understand in last lecture that most of the chain most of the polymer chains are flexible , and when they are dissolved in solution and they are moved in solution , they actually carry the solvent molecules which are attached to the polymer coil ; they move along with the polymer coil .	4.03422239779016

So , you can imagine a equivalent sphere width which contains a polymer chain and the solvent molecules as impermeable hard sphere , and for that hard sphere we know that Einstein ’ s equation of viscosity is given by this expression where eta and eta 0 is the viscosities for the suspension and suspension medium which is basically a polymer solution and the solvating medium or the solvent .	2.928969324662709

Phi 2 is the volume fraction which is given by volume of polymer divided by total volume ; this is total volume .	4.6093302886528305

Volume of polymer is given by number of polymer molecules V h ; V h is the volume of one polymer , hydrodynamic volume of one polymer coil .	3.7450495646657433

It is basically the sphere which I showed in last one ; the polymer chain plus the solvent molecules which moves along with the polymer coil and you can imagine an equivalent sphere .	4.026439907842988

So , the V h is the volume of that sphere divide by total volume is the number of particle which is Avogadro number multiplied by moles of polymer V h by total volume N A .	3.2093527369448163

The number of polymer and the moles of polymers can be expressed by mass of the polymer divided by the molecular rate of the polymer V h by total volume .	5.764288152066921

This gives m by V N A V h by M ; m by V is the concentration , c concentration in mass per unit volume .	3.0005711738174825

So , we can write this as c by M N a V h .	3.2633793921789906

And eta s p you know if you recollect ; eta s p is eta r minus 1 , eta by eta 0 minus 1 .	3.2276550346588193

So , you can directly write this expression from this .	5.2786160291725635

Now I can rearrange it ; because increasing viscosity is given by limits c tends to 0 eta s p by c which is basically given by N A eta s p by c which is you can write from here , you divide by c and you get this expression .	3.2597582058871617

Now what does it mean ?	4.592161118776184

It means that intrinsic viscosity is proportional to V h by M ; V h by m is volume by mass of the polymer coil .	3.55497083211346

This is the volume of a polymer coil one polymer coil and this is the molecular weight ; that means mass of one polymer coil ; that means intrinsic viscosity relates inversely to the density ; it is inverse to the density of the random coil .	3.488443247098193

So denser the coil volume , the smaller the intrinsic viscosity as we have been discussing earlier that if the coil becomes more denser , then smaller is the size and smaller is the intrinsic viscosity for the same molecular weight .	3.5571933561206923

As we discussed for branched polymer if you compare between linear and a branched polymer from same molecular weight , the branch will have more compact volume .	3.7026474287302102

So , in that case intrinsic viscosity will be smaller .	4.692588542203948

Now another information this expression gives is that the term intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molecular weight is given by this which only depend up on the volume of the polymer coil in the solution .	4.447596417813826

So , intrinsic viscosity does not depend only on the volume ; it depends on inverse of the density .	3.8859928621017064

But if you have intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molecular weight , the intrinsic viscosity only this term the intrinsic viscosity multiplied M depends only on the hydrodynamic volume .	4.017838766737626

So , if there are two hydrodynamic chains having same hydrodynamic volume irrespective of the chemical and structural difference , the product of intrinsic viscosity and the molecule would be the same .	3.4385001157579076

If the two polymer coils have same hydrodynamic volume , irrespective of their chemical and structural difference , the product of intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight will be same .	3.1055064202513725

Now just the same information which we discussed we can compare between a branched chain and a linear chain .	3.581223905996995

These are the yellow ones of the branched of this linear polymer ; imagine this two have same molecular weight .	2.593418685487909

If this two have same molecular weight obviously if you have branches then it will have more compact structure .	4.651166757492017

So , hydrodynamic volume will be lower in this case .	6.65443343701989

So , molecular weight is M ; in this case molecular weight also M .	6.025986812361552

Segment density of the coil is lower ; segment density is higher .	4.130452173036153

So , intrinsic viscosity of this will be higher than the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polymer chain have the same molecular and if you divide branch by the linear , the value of the branch intrinsic viscosity of linear one you can get the extent of branching in this polymer coil .	4.3397972304424535

Now we will further treat this expression and see whether we can arrive at an expression which can help us in determining the molecular weight by dilute solution viscometry .	3.3545163743370625

We have not started discussion on molecular weight determination .	4.417691930966222

So , this title is probably inappropriate at this moment .	3.5219101268148596

So , you can just ignore this title for this moment and just concentrate on the mathematical part of this expression .	2.822467296733231

We have got this earlier .	6.344164563474781

So , this was written V h ; now we are writing you can consider this as V h .	4.006070621398906

So , I am writing this .	8.124011633809731

Now V h is the volume of the particle .	5.705483172687556

Now remember while discussing the radius of gyration , we discussed that radius of gyration is almost like the radius of that sphere .	4.033414260648426

So , this radius of gyration would be related proportional to the actual radius of this hydrodynamic polymer coil .	3.668101649882144

So , the volume V h would be proportional to the R g cube ; volume given by four - third pi r square , r is this r .	2.5436992243492083

Now this r we said it is proportional to the radius of gyration .	3.6088013673686437

If you can recollect our discussion in the definition of radius of gyration , these are very close .	4.650933466954383

So , we can write that V h is proportional ; this proportionality sign is missing here .	3.146519637073518

V h is proportional to the radius of gyration to the power 3 and radius of gyration can be written as the expansion factor and radiation gyration for the unpart of chain .	3.5124615845336695

So , we can write that intrinsic viscosity is proportional to ; the proportionality sign is also missing here is V h which is proportional to this term divide by M .	2.9539168742976303

Now , we can remove this proportionality by applying or introducing a constant ; this is a constant .	3.5428766222197807

So , we can write intrinsic viscosity is equals to this term .	5.2922982941393135

So , remember this should be h because we have mentioned h in the last lecture .	3.7401597040830166

So these are all h , V h expansion factor h .	3.7593242877935182

So , this is the expansion factor because of the polymer solvent interaction .	7.594140624696455

This is expansion happened due to because the polymer coil is in solvent .	4.118673172342841

We can rearrange this expression and write like this which is just a mathematical rearrangement ; you can write this .	4.708757752635366

Now if we recollect , this was proportional to n to the power half which is proportional to molecular into half which means three by two divide by m 3 by 2 would be some constant term because this two are proportional .	2.4797259143219863

So , what we are doing here ; this is a constant as I just discussed , this is also constant and we are clubbing these two in another constant and you have the expansion factor and molecular weight to the power half .	4.022908737382515

These expressions are Flory - Fox equation and remember as we said this expansion factor is for large expansion , it was proportional to n to the power one - tenth .	2.834260345834142

So , it is approximately proportional to n into the power 10 .	3.8157315570586507

So , you can now write ; you can express this is in terms of molecular weight and then couple those two and write k is M to power A .	3.3986691535927527

So , this expression we got from the theoretical calculation which we just carried out but it was before this theoretical expression was arrived by Flory Fox , Mark and Houwink has actually arrived to this expression semiempirically by experimentally .	2.3294790473620224

So , this expression is known as Mark - Houwink equation .	5.111673867232742

This equation later we will use for determining molecular weight by dilute solution viscometry So , please remember this expression where k is constant and a is also constant .	3.13948439098828

We will learn more about k and a , and we will discuss the solution determination of molecular in solution viscometry or you can now complete that discussion .	3.7235130212442518

So , as I said that Mark - Houwink equation derived before Flory - Fox equation as a empirical equation .	2.8933539489913263

Now k and a are constant as we just discussed while deriving the expression and t s ; that is same that is constant for a given polymer solvent temperature system .	3.128292401801616

So if you change any of these three polymer solvent and temperature , then k and a value will be changed .	3.6759547968690494

So , this is only constant if you have same polymer and solvent temperature because if you change either of them V h , the coil dimension will change and your gyration radius of the expansion factor will also change .	3.213648304654085

So , these values also will change .	5.202181777584709

Normally a lies 0.5 to 0.8 for linear chains and if your very stiff chains like rod - like , then it a can move up to 1 .	2.573931879066625

But for linear flexible chains , it will be between 0.5 to 0.8 and for theta condition what we have seen earlier for theta condition , what is the value of a s or expansion factor for theta condition efficient ?	3.701182473323221

It was for one .	9.008979412331009

S , if this is one , then for theta conditions a value would be 0.5 .	4.779288269035903

Now a increases as the coil expansion occurs in good solvent ; in good solvent the coil expands .	2.905553446860029

So , the value of expansion factor becomes more than one .	5.684847625398274

So , a value becomes more than 0.5 .	6.723084364921364

Now k increases with the value of a for flexibility ; typically you have seen it has been seen that k also increases with the increase in the value of a and it is typically around this range .	4.5707605945374095

a is more informative in polymer ; you will find that a is more probably more important than between these two constant .	3.2075606246658315

Now for branched polymer , obviously , even if even you consider theta condition and put a branched polymer , then the expansion factor will be lower than the one if you compare with a linear polymer .	3.2202466826169482

So , you are a value could be lower 0.5 .	4.419993711575727

For linear polymer it can never go down below 0.5 but if you have branched polymer it is more compact .	4.528804501090871

So , the expansion factor will be ; if you compare the expansion factor of unperturbed linear polymer chain it may go down below that below one .	3.4321944891284155

So , the intrinsic viscosity would be smaller as a becomes smaller .	3.8807423919587127

Now , this expression becomes little more complicated when you have copolymers , you are characterizing copolymers .	3.1655947253764603

As I said we will use this expression Mark - Houwink expression when we try to determine the molecular weight ; we will discuss the determination of molecular weight of polymer chain by viscosity method .	4.022025954623026

Now let us start our very important discussion how to determine the molecular weight and at the beginning what I would like to do I will just give an overview of the techniques which are available and used to determine the molecular weight .	3.2886117405217856

Actually you can divide these techniques into two types ; one is absolute molecular weight determination where we do not require any calibration curve of priority by known polymer molecular weights .	2.817019721783337

And there are relative methods where you actually require a calibration curve by known polymer molecular weight where the molecule and the molecular have been determined by these absolute techniques .	2.8452027914299043

We will discuss the principle and the other things the process while we discuss this techniques individually .	3.324632799369759

So , time being we are not spending much time on these techniques .	4.474774782846495

What we will do , again this is the continuation of the list we have and we will spend significant of time on the techniques which are used very frequently in the labs like Gel Permeation Chromatography , light scattering technique , dilute solution viscometry and end group analysis and membrane osmomtery .	2.70057495001691

These first four techniques are based on colligative property , so the principles are similar .	3.112458237483616

So , if you discuss or understand one of them , the rest will be clear to you and all this gives because colligative property is based on the number of average molecular weight .	2.9928180731678626

So , this all gives number of molecular weight .	4.422945137835527

Instead of spending more time on this table , which we will discuss in more detail when we discuss the individual techniques , let us move to the actual techniques .	3.2163162157834617

Now we have seen that this is the expression for dilute polymers , the intrinsic viscosity of polymers in dilute polymer solution and what I can find out .	4.319573933890632

This intrinsic viscosity is k by M .	6.1968920161267596

Now as the technique suggest this is using the dilute solution of viscometry .	3.376823293835859

So , the molecular weight given is M v where M v is viscosity average molecular weight .	3.6615469923391073

We will just in a minute we deduce what the expression for viscosity average molecular weight .	3.6202805118262376

You know this assumption is reasonably okay to do is one ; the eta specific viscosity is given by the summation of the specific viscosity of the individual chains .	3.373789524846035

Now as you know that radial polymer mixtures , there are numerous polymer chains having different molecular weight .	3.2318164357608383

So in intrinsic , these are the assumptions we are making that specific viscosity can be obtained by summing up the specific viscosity of the individual polymer chain .	3.293933868221417

Second , a specific viscosity of the individual chains can be obtained by this expression .	4.664761917110917

Because we know that limit c tends to 0 eta sp by c is your intrinsic viscosity .	3.50437467713616

So if the solution is very dilute , then we can write eta s p i is c i eta i .	3.7493337770823194

Third is the intrinsic viscosity of i chain is given by k M i a ; that means what we are assuming that k and a values are independent of the molecule .	3.8449622515611392

So , eta s p i is the intrinsic viscosity of n i moles of molecules having molecular weight M i present at a concentration of c i per unit volume .	3.392329484236442

So , c i can be written as n i is the number of molecule ; M i is the molecular weight of that molecule .	4.522442365972282

So , this gives you total mass of i molecule divided by volume mass .	2.998496324322285

So , this gives your concentration in terms of mass by volume .	4.380406152105118

So now , we can find out the expression for the intrinsic viscosity for the polymer sample which is the mixture of all the polymer chain which is given by limit c tends to 0 eta specific by c ; eta specific is given by summation of i c .	4.260964023277748

We can continue to write this is as summation of eta i c i by c .	3.3008268093711184

We can write the value for c i n i M i by V and c is basically summation of c i .	3.3628863233430404

So , we can write n i M i by V .	4.110740251436856

So I can write , let me write in a separate page .	3.654823465679357

n i is given by , if I can take out k outside this summation .	5.58998658945793

Now we can write ; so you get this expression .	6.613892933916079

This is for ultimately the expression for we started from this intrinsic viscosity and we did this all the steps and finally reached here .	3.2128728163531126

Now intrinsic viscosity ; if you compare this two expressions then we can write this m V is .	4.321324374661623

So , you get this expression .	6.458023434289945

If a is one which we just we discussed it is for highly elongated rod like molecule , then m V would be same as M w .	2.8945659893918454

If a one then it will be n i M i square by n i M i .	4.106425817644593

So , it will be equals to M w as a value lies between 0.5 to 0.8 ; M w will be M v , M v would be more than M n and less than M w .	3.4528293826161707

Let me write in a fresh paper .	4.609494681887143

M v is given by as a is between 0.5 to 0.8 M v would lie M n and M w and it will be much more closer towards M w if a is higher ; if the coil expand , it will be more expansion more closer to M w and for highly stiff rods where a is 1 , M v becomes equals to M w .	3.169985572506159

So now , we know k is intrinsic viscosity is M v by a .	4.339939642737366

Now we just got the expression for M v which is given here which is the expression for M v .	4.588077432090607

So , from here if you plot .	8.31871632855873

What happened if k and a are not known ?	4.7681724674108565

Then you can find , you take log eta plot with log M v ; you get log eta is log k plus a log M v .	2.812400966759748

So , if you plot log of intrinsic viscosity with log of viscosity average molecular weight , the intercept will give you log k and the slope will give you a .	4.015612867657272

So , what you need to find out ; if you know for experiment or if you from literature in the book , you are fine , you can get and determine experimentally the value for intrinsic viscosity and you can utilize this expression to get the viscosity average molecular weight .	3.6222732205046637

But if you do not know ; somebody has done it before means for unknown sample , the unknown sample this k and a are not listed .	2.9211626928062286

Then what you need to do ; you need to plot log of intrinsic viscosity with many known molecular weight and then you do you do a experimental take five to ten samples and make dilute solutions from that determine the intrinsic viscosity and plot this to get log k and a .	3.3912404475514384

Now the question is here ?	6.234909254592691

You need to plot log M v ; that is what you need to determine .	4.9865866419304625

If you are plotting here log m v , now you are again targeting M v for the unknown molecules .	2.6777281173274887

So , then you do not know the M v .	6.015353898303639

This is a calibration curve which you are getting by doing experiments of intrinsic viscosity measurement of many polymer molecular of known molecular weight .	3.224415418380367

Now known molecular weight can be either M n or M w which you already determined by the absolute techniques .	3.683446917551227

We will come back and say it again .	4.927995370920119

If k and a are not known , what you need to do ?	4.549113898380036

You make , say , 5 solutions or 5 different molecular weight ; M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , M 4 , M5 and then measure the intrinsic viscosity for these eta 1 , eta 2 , eta 3 , eta 4 , eta 5 and then plot log of eta versus log of M and get log of k .	3.007714908257266

Now actually this is supposed to M v , the expression gives you k is eta is k M v to the power a .	3.1904906757735145

So , ideally you should have M v value for all these samples which you do not have because that is what you are determining .	4.09342029875067

So , what samples you will use for calibration where M v is much closer to any of the known molecular weight , say , M n and M w .	3.0560093100358188

Now if you have very narrow dispersed polymer , then you can consider M w or M n is same as M v .	4.72002460722271

If you have very narrow dispersed polymer then M w are very close to M v .	3.650404657288337

So , you can take those M w ’ s and use here and do the calibration curve .	3.609900251465915

So if your k and a are not known , you need to have five different molecular weight of that solution where the molecular weights are known by other absolute techniques and the samples should be such that they are very narrowly dispersed .	3.3605966211438116

So , that M n and M w can be equated to the M v .	3.486533197273553

So , that is the reason it is a relative method ; it is not a absolute method .	4.869930698991449

You cannot determine M v for a unknown polymer by as such ; you need to have a calibration curve and for doing calibration curve , you need to have 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 known molecular weight narrow dispersed same polymer whose molecular weight you need to get it from the other absolute techniques like osmotic pressure or light scattering techniques .	2.9628420853563506

Then you can determine the viscosity average molecule rate of the unknown sample which k and a is not known in the literature .	4.163120398787512

So , for all this case we need ; we said that will determine the intrinsic viscosity .	5.32245806529846

Now how will you determine ?	6.839577761481876

For a given polymer sample in a solvent for a particular temperature how will you determine , how will you determine eta intrinsic viscosity ?	3.31316077507873

Eta is given by limit c tends to 0 eta s p by c .	3.7934069512339135

Now if for a dilute solution , the plot of eta s p versus c is linear only till your eta r is less than equals to 2 .	2.825114082615452

So , if your eta value of the solution is twice 2x the eta 0 maximum , then you can find out that eta s p is linearly related with the concentration term .	3.650157232528831

So , we can write the eta s p is linearly related to c concentration only till eta r is less than 2 .	2.749429131261156

So eta s p by c can be written as , this is the slope of that linear relationship between eta s p by c with c and that is only applicable till eta r is less than 2 .	3.2319113233912384

Now this k the slope depends on the molecular rate of polymer ; it is not equal for all the lengths of polymer .	4.772073484949952

So , we need to find out something else where that constant can be applied to any of the molecular rate of the polymer chains .	4.871010615144417

So , Huggins found out that k versus eta square is linear and pass through origin ; k is the slope .	3.301250751463964

So , we can write d eta s p by c by d c ; this is the slope k that is proportional linear .	3.6393363782990367

Now you can integrate this ; you integrate this , you get c is equal to eta 1 .	4.124770235492796

Now because Huggins has established this relationship , sometimes this k 1 is written as k H .	3.375442634907168

So , eta s p by c is written as plus k h eta square c .	2.9586619457568397

This is Huggins constant ; this is Huggins equations .	4.150391790034025

Now this is constant for a particular polymer solvent temperature system .	4.388469061515946

You change any of this change .	8.146936869152231

You change any of these three ; polymer solvent or temperature , it will vary ; the value of k H will vary .	3.6684084946405298

It is of course independent of M w of the polymer .	4.169293576175288

So , now you can use this for the mixture of the polymer or interpolymer distribution so that it can be useful , because it is independent of molecular weight .	5.041648799396313

Now if the concentration is little higher , we talked about this is only applicable for eta r is less than equals to two if the concentration is higher , then this expression can be expressed like the real expression where plus other constant and so on if eta c is less than much less than one , you can ignore this terms higher term c square onwards terms , then you land up getting the Huggins expression again .	2.801013968574021

So only in case of dilute solution , you can consider only up to ; these higher terms you can neglect .	3.9117979436387094

k H have value between 0.3 for good solvent to 0.5 for poor solvent .	2.995092234915097

Now in this case from this Huggins expression or Huggins equation , you only need the value of k H .	3.2763800817225417

If this is known if k H is known , then obviously you can determine intrinsic viscosity by plotting eta s p by c versus c till the c is very dilute ; you know c should not be very high .	2.826682700428905

So the solution remains very dilute , then you can keep the expression for eta from the intercept and if you know k H , then you can get the expression ; you can get the value of molecular weight directly .	4.609294312188644

If you know k H , you also will know intrinsic viscosity , then you will know from the expression you can get that molecular weight .	3.647640177364891

Now alternatively we can use the inherent viscosity which can be expressed and specific viscosity is much lower than 1 .	4.976380963659877

This expression can be written eta s p minus half eta square .	4.7446362822721735

So , this Huggins equation can now be written as directly eta r is equals to c plus .	3.629340827489465

So , this gives the similar expression like the Huggins expression but this in terms of the inherent viscosity and this expression this constant is named at the person who has given this ; this is Kramer ’ s equation where K k is k H minus half .	2.6819325990039706

So , it will be a negative quantity .	6.971242239810448

So , now we have two expressions Huggins equation and Kramer ’ s equation .	3.721074345629866

So , you can plot eta s p or this term inherent viscosity with respect to c and then from slope and the intercept , you can get the value of intrinsic viscosity .	3.6243416378087447

So , I can plot either eta reduced which is nothing but eta s p by c or we can plot eta inherent which is ln into r by c and we will get .	3.1068153006124133

In case of Kramer that constant is negative we just saw .	3.3201898824695117

In case of Kramer this is negative , so the slope will be negative .	3.919469968406921

And in case of Huggins this is positive ; the slope will be positive .	4.545829610465467

So , this will be eta reduced plot for eta reduced and the other one will be plot eta inherent .	3.626628293936517

So , from this you can get the value of the intrinsic viscosity .	6.067183199967865

So in summary if we know this Mark - Houwink equation where M v expression we just have seen .	3.4237502524746697

Now using either this Huggins equation or Kramer equation , you can plot either the reduced viscosity or the inherent viscosity with the concentration term to get experimentally the intrinsic viscosity .	2.830897192428289

So , this is in your hand .	6.516566319438869

You can make solutions of different concentration and you can measure viscosity of the solvent and viscosity of the solution and from viscosity of the solution and solvent you get relative viscosity and from there you get specific viscosity and from there you get reduced viscosity and inherent viscosity .	2.9676236836320267

So , these are all in your hand .	5.531154372459059

You can get a viscometer and typically the viscosity is measured by passing using this different viscometer where the solvent and the solution is passed through the capillary where the time is proportional to the viscosity .	3.150701589261476

So , basically if you measure the time of reflux time of the solution and the solvent from the receiver , you can get the relative viscosity and from there you can get the reduced viscosity and inherent viscosity .	3.4460672418429654

So basically you plot , you make different solution with different concentration and plot ; with this you get the intrinsic viscosity .	3.6495586107042377

So once you know this , if you know k and a , you can use this expression to find out M v .	5.419750988377291

As you have seen if you know the k H or K k the Huggins constant or the Kramer constant k H or K k , then only from one concentration itself you can get the value of intrinsic viscosity the molecular weight .	2.932399888946799

And if you do not know this k or a the k H or K k , then the process is to determine some or few or very narrowly dispersed same polymer and get the absolute molecular weight from any other techniques , and because it is suppose has to be very narrow dispersed polymer , you can take any of the M n or M w as equals to M v .	3.104834533776337

And you find out the intrinsic viscosity for this given polymer and then by plotting log intrinsic viscosity versus log molecular weight , you can get k and a value ; from that you can get this M v .	3.868952570132023

Remember whatever we are doing in this determination there are few precautions you have to take ; you have to make the solution to determine the intrinsic viscosity such that the concentrations of the solutions is very low .	3.994661033366171

It must be in dilute solution , a very dilute solution region and also you need to remember that relative number in this method , you cannot get a measurement for an unknown polymer as such .	2.8432112295343437

It is not absolute method ; it is a relative method .	5.2364584713436155

We were yesterday talking about reversible inhibition that is those inhibitor molecules which reduce the rate of an enzymatic reaction by reversible interaction with enzyme molecule and after the inhibition is over they can be physically separated and the enzyme can be recovered in its original catalytic functional form .	2.949386610707501

These reversible inhibitors are often categorized into three major classes based on certain general features and some of the general features which are used to classify them are : One is pattern of binding of the inhibitor to either the enzyme molecule or the enzyme substrate complex or in another words it leads to specific mechanistic steps which are involved in the inhibitory effect .	2.8892591325710173

That means the enzyme reaction rate is modified or rather reduced to a new state in the presence of those inhibitor molecules .	3.631964780157531

Based on that mechanism then the rate expression has evolved which also has characteristic features and for particular class of inhibitor .	3.2536262766388857

Then one looks at the effect of inhibitor on the Michaelis Menten constant and the maximum reaction velocity of reaction .	4.414605557335234

A particular class of inhibitor gives you a typical effect on the value of Km or Vm .	4.949146277271426

Then another feature is the effect on the double reciprocal plot , Lineweaver - Burk plot and the nature of Lineweaver - Burk plot which is influenced as a function of inhibitor concentration will also tell you about the class of a particular inhibitor .	3.2632481476233512

Finally the type of inhibitor also influences the ultimate degree of inhibition .	4.1847647435429485

As I mentioned earlier the degree of inhibition is defined as i = v0 - vi / vo where i is the degree of inhibition and v0 and vi are the enzyme reaction rate at concentration of inhibitor at zero and at some particular concentration i for the enzyme reaction .	3.025013606518953

Any inhibition pattern is studied on these basic lines and yesterday we had looked at competitive inhibition and to summarize the nature of competitive inhibition the basic mechanistic step was that the inhibitor combines with the enzyme in a manner that prevents substrate binding .	2.7850042360984557

It may occupy the same binding site .	5.346843490924122

Their effect on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction is just to increase the apparent Michaelis Menten constant .	5.548059897721369

The maximum reaction velocity remains unchanged .	7.974010415508356

The inhibition constant that is the reversible binding of enzyme with the inhibitor and the corresponding dissociation constant is equivalent to the concentration of inhibitor that doubles the slope of initial reaction velocity that is inverse double reciprocal plot 1 / v verses 1 / S plot .	3.91919291590765

If you recall in the case of competitive inhibition we have seen that 1 / vi = Km / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) .1 / S + 1 / Vm The Michaelis Menten constant is modified by the amount 1 + I / Ki and therefore the value of Ki is equivalent to that concentration of the inhibitor at which the slope of the double reciprocal plot is double .	4.237251194962088

That means from the initial slope , the value of slope doubles and that concentration of inhibitor gives you the magnitude of Ki .	4.57223001998943

Then degree of inhibition for the competitive inhibition also depends upon all the parameters and the expression for degree of inhibition for competitive inhibitor can be written as Km.I / Ki i = { Km ( 1 + I / Ki ) } + S The degree of inhibition depends on substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration and also on Km and Ki .	3.1927629694863766

All the parameters influence the degree of inhibition at any given inhibitor concentration for the competitive inhibitor .	3.695308687644558

This is what we had discussed yesterday .	7.373085309448423

Now if we come to the next major class of reversible inhibitor which is a non - competitive inhibitor , the classical feature of a non - competitive inhibitor in terms of binding with the enzyme or the enzyme substrate is that the inhibitor does not influence in any way the substrate binding .	4.255230983576413

Substrate as well as the inhibitor binds reversibly , randomly and independently at different sites .	4.095255150661273

That means the binding site on the enzyme molecule for the substrate is different from the binding site for the inhibitor molecule .	5.150931292507774

The enzyme molecule binds to both ; substrate as well as inhibitor and the resulting ESI complex is functionally inactive .	3.6433584745374827

Therefore one can look at the reaction mechanism as k1 k2 E + S ES E + P k - 1 A classical route involving k1 , k - 1 and k2 .	3.5168649342705725

E + S ES E + P + + I I EI + S ESI The enzyme can also bind to inhibitor giving EI and because the binding site of the substrate is different , EI can again bind to form ESI and the ES can also bind to I to give ESI .	2.7964779009753706

The enzyme substrate inhibitor complex , the triple complex , can be arrived at either from this route or from this route because the binding of substrate and inhibitor do not interfere with each other .	2.694801762127116

They can bind reversibly , randomly and independently ; there is no interaction within them .	3.7031133225879147

But only thing is that this ESI complex once formed is catalytically inactive and does not lead to product formation .	3.080662742665643

It is only ES complex which will lead to product formation .	4.045207768022965

In a simplistic mechanism we notice that we have a dissociation constant Km for the enzyme substrate binding and dissociation constant Ki for the inhibitor binding .	3.7276378739286913

Also we assume that whether the enzyme substrate complex bind to inhibitor or the free enzyme binds to the inhibitor the dissociation constant is identical Ki .	4.111726606114268

Similarly when substrate binds to EI complex , dissociation constant is Km .	3.99722460306035

There is no interference by binding of substrate or inhibitor onto the enzyme in their subsequent binding process .	3.54128024128275

Under such conditions one can write the rate expression for a non - competitive inhibitor as S .	4.51363369356933

Vm v0 = Km ( 1 + I / Ki ) + S ( 1 + I / Ki ) To simplify , to look at the effect on Km and Vm values , if we divide both the numerator and denominator by ( 1 + I / Ki ) S .	3.2436333866855485

Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) v0 = Km + S One can very clearly visualize that the effect of a non - competitive inhibitor is to influence the maximum reaction velocity and maximum reaction velocity is reduced by factor of ( 1 + I / Ki ) whereas the Km value remains unchanged .	3.2940068422577795

There is no effect on the Km value .	6.228297081427862

In contrast to the competitive inhibitor where the Km value was altered here the Vm value gets altered .	3.2817571665390854

The modified maximum reaction velocity is equal to Vm ’ = Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) If you look at into the mechanic concept the total fraction of the enzyme molecule which was originally present for catalytic function has now got distributed into ES , EI and EIS and only a part of it which is in the form of ES is catalytically functional and therefore the maximum reaction velocity which is a function of enzyme concentration is reduced .	3.352677041004792

It does not influence the K2 value , the turn over number , because as we know Vm = K2.E ’ 0 Here E0 , in the presence of non - competitive inhibitor , corresponds to that fraction of total enzyme which is in the form of ES .	3.271914342252084

The ESI complex form is functionally inactive and therefore the K2 is not altered .	3.9004827463627185

It is the E0 which is modified or reduced by a factor of 1 + I / Ki .	3.36310016020527

E0 is a fixed quantity when there is no inhibitor in the reaction .	5.214573081805273

Once the inhibitor is present the E0 will be distributed into free enzyme , E , ES , EI and ESI .	3.143467260508244

E0 is not reduced but the effective total concentration of the enzyme , E ’ 0 , which is catalytically functional is reduced and it is only the ES component which is catalytically functional .	4.028407211824951

In many cases the binding of substrate can influence the catalytic function on the substrate binding .	4.782891621824445

Binding wise it may be independent .	7.25713877418767

There are two parts in the active site .	4.317528550416734

One is the binding process which is not influenced which is elaborated by our dissociation constant .	3.9627993804764827

The binding part of the active site is demonstrated by the dissociation constant .	5.313351952754727

The second part which is demonstrated is the catalytic function which is given by K2 , the turn over number .	4.023283286478248

That can be influenced by binding of the inhibitor .	5.646864380515509

Turn over number is unaffected here .	6.8373594846264405

In the case of the non - competitive inhibition , the turn over number will be unaffected as far as the kinetic parameter is concerned .	3.6646240746669716

But it can influence the catalytic capacity of the enzyme molecule in total .	5.691819163401657

This is where the question comes that when the substrate and the inhibitor both are bound it influences the whole molecule in such a way that catalytic function is lost .	3.106976555904986

It is a dead end complex and then the binding site on the enzyme which is bound by the substrate is not able to give the product .	5.053473675300378

But when I say K2 , I am referring K2 in the sense of the original catalytic function which was present , which is retained and only in the presence of a bound inhibitor on the inhibitor binding site , the catalytic function is lost .	3.287220513015558

The double reciprocal plot in the presence of non - competitive inhibitor is given as 1 / v = Km / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) .1 / S + 1 / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) In the case of a non - competitive inhibitor both the slope as well as intercept will undergo a change and both this slope and intercept has increased by a magnitude 1 + I / Ki and therefore if you look at the pattern of the Lineweaver Burk plot you get an increasing concentration of I .	3.1319736319834934

Let us assume that this is I = 0 and some values of I as I1 and I2 .	3.8463247127552407

The slope and the intercept are both increasing by a magnitude of 1 + I / Ki .	3.6555973975531764

Therefore one can determine the value of Ki as we saw in the case of competitive inhibitor by a secondary plot .	3.806716300650797

That means either you determine slope or intercept at different inhibitor concentration and make a plot between I and slope or intercept .	2.928275668765491

You will get a straight line because slope will be equal to Slope = Km / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) Therefore one can determine the value or magnitude of Ki either by plotting the slope verses the inhibitor concentration or by intercept .	3.314428342282448

Either way one can determine and that can give you the magnitude of inhibition constant .	5.4513346276870145

The third category of the reversible inhibitor is un - competitive inhibition .	3.567861802364115

In this category of reversible inhibitors the inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme substrate complex .	3.306257130102689

It doesn ’ t have any mechanism to recognize the free enzyme .	3.7456780509831615

Only when the substrate is bound to the enzyme it can bind to the enzyme substrate complex and after binding of the inhibitor the ES complex becomes an inactive complex and the inhibitor does not bind to the free enzyme .	3.916511758763615

km k2 E + S ES E + P + I ki ESI ES can bind to inhibitor giving you ESI .	3.251990811917456

This is the dissociation constant Ki , classical Km and K2 .	4.393375104001744

The inhibitor can bind to only to the ES complex and does not bind to the free enzyme .	3.8632042795281527

Such situations are very rare as far as the unisubstrate reactions are concerned .	3.450157024814764

Very few cases , almost rare cases are there where one notices this kind of un - competitive inhibition .	2.7769265743413873

Most of these cases are usually related to bisubstrate reactions particularly because you notice here that the inhibitor binds after the substrate is bound .	3.390419704454668

So there is a sequence of binding .	7.296133421333246

In cases only where there is ordered sequence of binding of the ligands , the un - competitive inhibition is feasible .	3.3757365798754404

In cases where the binding is random , that means the inhibitor and substrate can bind randomly without any sequence , the mechanism of un - competitive inhibition is very rare .	3.529397313459518

The idea of un - competitive inhibition has been very , very useful in understanding the reaction mechanism for bi substrate reactions .	3.3769899369837417

When we look at bisubstrate reactions we notice that this inhibition pattern gives you lot of information about the sequence of binding of the substrate in the case of a bisubstrate reaction .	3.48528406772555

In the case of an un - competitive inhibition the reaction velocity can be written as S .	4.3762942131706

Vm v = Km + S ( 1 + I / Ki ) To bring it to the same format of Michaelis Menten equation , if you can divide both numerator and denominator by ( 1 + I / Ki ) S .	3.9526906464739175

Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) v = Km / ( 1 + I / Ki ) + S Km ’ = Km / ( 1 + I / Ki ) ; Vm ’ = Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) Both the parameters are reduced by a factor of ( 1 + I / Ki ) and the double reciprocal plot in the presence of un - competitive inhibitor will be 1 / v = Km / Vm.1 / S + 1 / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) Therefore you will notice that the un - competitive inhibitor does not change the slope .	3.3862274072452867

The slope remains unaltered but the intercept is increased .	3.9828918451901996

This is your intercept and the intercept 1 / Vm on the y axis is increased by a factor of ( 1 + I / Ki ) .	3.3781519429853017

The typical pattern of an un - competitive inhibitor looks like parallel lines where the slope doesn ’ t change but the intercept value 1 / Vm is changed .	2.5173586956646528

If you make a secondary plot of 1 / Km ’ verses I , 1 / Km ’ = 1 / Km + I / Km.Ki you will get the value of Ki .	4.556600595134162

One can also look at the double reciprocal equation , Lineweaver Burk equation , make a double reciprocal plot , see the nature of double reciprocal plot and identify the nature of inhibitor which we are talking about by understanding these .	3.589776805050369

In many cases we will also notice that the actual inhibitor does not follow a very typical pattern and very often we end up with a profile that intersects neither on the y - axis nor on the x - axis and intersects somewhere in the middle point .	2.582267062950861

Such a situation can be considered something away from the ideality , a kind of mixed type of inhibition .	3.5747343762269925

One of the most commonly observed mixed type of inhibition is what we call as linear mixed type inhibition .	3.344457584604893

This is a typical case of a non - competitive inhibition .	5.89918652210212

In non - competitive inhibition we considered the binding of the inhibitor to either the substrate or the free enzyme .	3.9045854639979733

In that case we assumed , one basic factor , that the dissociation constant for binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme and the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme substrate complex is identical .	3.7649269011152717

But in many cases this may not be so .	5.669586169718793

The dissociation constant for binding of inhibitor to enzyme may be different from the dissociation constant for inhibitor binding to ES complex and there might be an interaction factor of alpha .	3.4667947099599385

In such a case ES going to E plus P .	3.3074857587623936

E binds to I with the dissociation factor of Ki to form EI .	3.2773368009105868

ES binds to the inhibitor with inhibition constant of a Ki to form ESI and substrate binds to EI .	3.218915278117746

If the inhibition constant for this is Km and if the system has to come to equilibrium , then the equilibrium constant for reaching ESI from either side must be identical and this inhibitor constant will also become a Km .	3.133596982235585

km E + S ES E + P + + I I ki aki akm EI + S ESI In most cases it so happens that the inhibition constant for binding of inhibitor to the free enzyme or binding of inhibitor to the enzyme substrate complex are not identical as assumed in the non - competitive inhibition and therefore the presence of inhibitor on the enzyme changes Km also by the same factor a Km and in such cases the rate expression becomes modified .	2.988280238958988

Vm . S vi = Km / ( 1 + I / Ki ) + S ( 1 + I / a Ki ) Km ( 1 + I / Ki ) ( 1 + I / a Ki ) 1 / vi = .	4.1825276121285775

+ Vm S Vm For cases where a &gt ; 1 you will get a profile in which the double reciprocal plot of 1 / S Vs 1 / v at different inhibitor concentrations will intersect at a point on the left hand side of the y - axis .	2.881442754972614

If you consider the slopes and the intercepts of this plot , a replot of the slope will give you Ki .	3.1473674120434563

If you replot the modified intercept as a function of inhibitor concentration it will give you a Ki and therefore value of a can be determined .	3.4215583901318825

Such profiles are indicative of modification of dissociation constant as a function of substrate binding in the presence of non - competitive inhibitors .	3.7006516598234414

Such cases are very commonly found and in most of the practical cases they are not usually ideal type of inhibition patterns .	4.385727026820639

They are mixed type of inhibition patterns and mixed inhibition pattern are attributed to modification in the dissociation constant as they are obtained .	3.301983734126947

Another general feature which gives you the properties or the characteristic of any type of inhibition pattern is degree of inhibition .	3.83436568565776

If you recall from all the rate expressions that we wrote for the different types of inhibition pattern i = v0 - vi / v0 For non - competitive inhibitors , if you substitute the rate expression for the inhibitor and uninhibited reaction for the non - competitive reactions the value of I will be I / Ki + I which indicates that the degree of inhibition is independent of substrate concentration , unlike in the case of competitive inhibition where increasing substrate inhibition can significantly decrease the degree of inhibition .	2.911028446655902

That means the extent by which the rate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction is reduced by the inhibitor can be reduced by increasing the substrate concentration in relation to inhibitor concentration .	4.628369234606861

In the case of non - competitive inhibition whatever be the concentration of substrate , it does not influence the degree of inhibition and it is totally dependent on the concentration of inhibitor and the Ki .	4.281338842488041

In the case of un - competitive inhibitor the degree of inhibition is S.I / Ki ( Km + S ) .	4.16463626662318

( 1 + I / Ki ) The degree of inhibition will rise from S = 0 when there is no reaction to a limiting value of 1 + I / Ki at very high value of substrate concentration .	3.7656074903883336

When the substrate concentration becomes very high , the degree of inhibition will be 1 + I / Ki but it will depend like competitive inhibition on all the parameters , the substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration , Ki and Km .	3.462398696548061

In the case of mixed inhibition , the degree of inhibition will be largely dependent upon the magnitude of a .	3.4242157382601377

The mixed inhibition is a special case of non - competitive inhibition where otherwise substrate concentration does not influence the degree of inhibition .	3.151204527378664

Because the binding sides are different and they don ’ t interfere with each other but in the case of mixed inhibition , the magnitude of inhibition will be dependent on the ratio of dissociation constant for free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex with the inhibitor .	3.813315987035991

a will determine the magnitude of the degree of inhibition .	6.1162245828033095

So these are some of the typical categories of inhibition pattern which are commonly noted and they have a key role to play in understanding the mechanism of variety of complex reactions particularly the bi - substrate reactions .	3.098955347604119

The inhibition patterns obtained for bisubstrate reactions gives you lot of information about the binding pattern of different substrate or the sequence of binding of the different substrate in the case of a multisubstrate reaction .	3.4642181452790335

In the case of single substrate reaction , that is what we have been talking so far , the life is simple because there is only one substrate and we are concerned with the binding of the substrate .	4.022042013336645

In the case of bisubstrate reactions we have much more possibilities , much more types of mechanistic approaches that are feasible and they are taken into account .	3.1937459755253848

When we say very high substrate concentration , S &gt ; &gt ; Km and we are talking of zero order design and then the degree of inhibition at very high substrate concentration will be significantly very high because then it will reach the limiting value of 1 + I / Ki .	3.702356671088137

Km becomes K and S gets cancelled and then degree of inhibition will be I / Ki. ( 1 + I / Ki ) .	3.473955448071083

It reaches a limiting value of 1 + I / Ki .	4.416658801982515

But otherwise at low substrate concentration that will be some where in between zero and that value .	4.2454066529131556

Another way is to look at the inhibition pattern in a generalized way rather than specific cases .	3.3546096607230083

If you look at a very generalized scheme of inhibition patterns kES E + S ES E + P kEI kESI EI ESI kES If you consider each of the reversible steps , we are not here really concerned with the irreversible step because that determines the rate of the reaction , the interaction of the reversible step the dissociation constant for this step is KES , this is the KEI , this is KESI and this is also KES .	3.1190647378839493

In the three different cases that we talked about for the type of inhibition , in the case of competitive inhibition magnitude of KESI will tend to infinity .	3.9318382455927754

KES and KEI will have definite magnitude .	4.3280984441536114

That means the enzyme can bind either to inhibitor or to a substrate and KES and KEI will have definite magnitude but the KESI either will be infinity and that is the typical case of a competitive inhibitor .	3.022987367666605

In the case of a non - competitive inhibitor KESI will be equal to KEI .	3.6238596488928936

That means these two dissociation constants are identical .	3.863448220372324

In the case of mixed inhibition they are different by a factor a and in the case of un - competitive inhibition the magnitude of KEI is infinity or rather tends to infinity .	3.207183591080794

That means the inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme .	4.556722487017051

The three cases are typical examples of three extreme situations of the inhibitor binding .	3.6329515422003844

In the competitive inhibitor the binding of the inhibitor to ES complex is not feasible and the dissociation constant is infinity .	4.277950505027552

In the case of non - competitive inhibition it can bind to either E or ES and the dissociation constant is identical .	3.278633783709761

In the case of mixed inhibition they are not identical but they have a magnitude and both are related by ratio of a and which determines the degree of inhibition .	3.1788758719654284

In the case of un - competitive inhibition , the dissociation constant for the binding of inhibitor to the free enzyme approaches to infinity .	4.128686887435906

That means binding to free inhibitor is not feasible .	3.834314515455985

With that view I think we would like to look at the other bisubstrate reactions subsequently and we will stop at this point .	3.49077746974552

Welcome to this lecture fourteen of the course on polymer chemistry .	3.1578146036716164

In this fourteenth lecture I plan to you know continue the discussion we had on the thermodynamics of radical polymerization , which is valid for other chain growth polymerizations as well .	3.1043389201963767

We talk about the molecular weight distribution and we will talk about different processes , different polymerization processes for radical polymerization .	4.855169047857181

Let us just recap couple of minutes on the topics we covered in last lecture .	3.167090229439485

We talked about the dependence on temperature , dependence of rate of polymerization and molecular weight on the temperature for radical polymerization initiated by different mechanism , thermal initiator , photochemical initiator and redox initiator .	3.2469206138467155

We in summary we knew that the initiation process is more slower and had the highest activation energy for thermal process .	3.2199106903635286

And also E d for thermal was higher than E d for redox than E d or a photochemical process .	2.8676280234935976

Now , you also remember in R p term there was plus half E d term on the numerator and in case of X n there was minus half E d term in the activation energy .	2.9275548294383

So , between this three processes thermal process redox process and photochemical processes .	2.9145951730549458

Thermo , thermal process because E d is highest it was getting effected by the temperature rise .	2.8622987316194886

The increase in the rate of polymerization was much higher in case of polymerization initiated by a thermal initiator , then redox initiator and then photo chemical initiator .	3.98346432091249

In case of molecular weight , again similar order , the molecular was getting dropped or reduced with increasing temperature mostly for thermal initiated reaction then for redox reaction and for photo chemical reaction because E d is actually 0 .	2.495029865077831

It was actually going up mildly .	5.01616805746998

In case of photochemical reaction it actually gets slight increase in molecular weight with increase in temperature .	3.07930833279179

And we were talking about the T c ceiling temperature and the equilibrium concentration of free monomer and we got this two expression .	4.270532273910253

And we from this expression we know that every temperature ; typically what we do in a in lab you actually start a reaction say in a beaker or in a round bottom flask and keep in a oil bath maintained or in some other maintained in a constant temperature .	2.951778489313719

Typically we do reaction polymerization reaction as well in a isothermal condition you know .	3.945056061469577

Now , each temperature you can consider , your reaction temperature you can consider as a ceiling temperature .	4.190895998873116

The equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration at that temperature determined by this value , del H p and del S p .	3.688254183343135

So , that reaction at the temperature will continue till the free monomer concentration reach to the equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration related to that temperature .	3.5214785357800196

And typically , for the monomers which we know undergo polymerization process , this equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration is very low .	4.007473705166448

So , we consider we assume that the polymerization is easy and polymerization undergo the monomers undergo almost quantity polymerization or convert almost nearly hundred percent .	2.66492634110175

If we increase the temperature of your reaction then what happens , M e goes up .	4.152617359169536

If you do a higher reaction at higher temperature then equilibrium concentration comes goes up that means your polymerization reaction stop at a higher free monomer concentration .	3.2319269776994064

So , if you choose to do in a higher temperature then you will always land up in a higher amount of unreacted monomer even if your reaction is complete or reached equilibrium .	3.4067256605335277

And if you keep on increasing the temperature , one temperature will come where that equilibrium concentration is equals to the free monomer concentration your know pure pure monomer concentration .	3.057694472283724

That means you can never polymerize at that temperature or beyond that temperature , which is 61 degree for methyl alpha methyl styrene we just talked about .	3.2166445580105725

69 degree the free equilibrium concentration of the equilibrium concentration the free monomer alpha methyl styrene was equal to the pure monomer concentration .	4.432643230976565

So , at 61 degree or beyond 61 degree you cannot at all polymerize alpha methyl styrene .	3.0422091307004653

As we can see that the T c value depends or the relation between T c and M e depends on the values of del H and del S p .	3.335540790020804

As I discussed at the last part of my lecture last lecture that delta is between polymer and monomer is basically change in entropy due to the translation motion vibration or rotational entropies and the rotational and vibration entropies of the monomer lost due to polymerization is actually gained in polymer .	2.4927610371707045

So , they do not take part or contribute too much in the delays value of polymerization , is basically that translational entropy drop for the monomers and which practically does not depend on the monomer structure .	3.0966738440374617

So , you will see that del S value is more or less more or less same for most of the monomers .	3.9681585220670206

But del H value will change as we were discussing in last lecture and that will depend upon the amount of stabilization which could be due to resonance or inductive effective or by hyper conservation or by the inter monomer complexes .	3.329291784042378

If more stabilization means lower value of del H which means lower value of T c and the higher the strain , that means higher is the energy of the polymer again the lower is the magnitude of the del H value .	3.92856303201601

Now , let us consider or let us compare few monomers and their del S .	3.4627355759563674

Now , del S and del G 0 .	6.168262660824963

So , let us compare between this two values .	5.518818807874767

Now , del S del H in this case is for pure monomer .	4.904725946586669

Where in case of del S a one molar solution , it could be either of this two , you have to pure monomer is converted into pure polymer which is either completely crystalline or slightly amorphous , del S you can also consider from pure to pure or a one molar solution of the monomer to a one molar solution of the polymer repeat unit .	3.3523872219845505

Now , this context you can appreciate that del H value does not depend on the concentration of the monomer whereas , del S value does depend .	3.6338839130334635

del S value is dependent on the concentration of the monomer .	6.467202690147214

Now , let us compare the values between few monomers and see whether how the monomer structure contribute to the values of , now the simplest monomer is ethylene and in case of ethylene this is from a pure gas to a polymer solid polymer .	3.2159631442330507

This is 93 kilo g per mole and this is 155 , compare this with this vinyl acetate .	3.7278566255606282

Now , this value is quite high .	7.573644794884079

This will be higher from any other because he was talking about this is a gas phase reaction .	4.536609179340335

The gas gaseous monomer is getting transferred to a polymer .	5.404949170792012

So , obviously drop in entropy will be much higher , these are negative numbers .	3.7016699050564923

Sorry , so this will be much higher .	9.489767134539939

When you talk about the solution phase then this values will be similar .	4.53327390582742

This is minus 88 minus 110 , acrylonitrile minus 76 minus 109 , methyl acrylate 78 , M M A minus 56 , propane minus 84 , one butyne minus 84 , isobutylene minus 48 , two more styrene minus 73 and alpha methyl styrene minus 35 .	2.312793367247573

This is minus 100 , minus 104 , 121 .	7.884352930303421

Now , you can see that this del H more or less same .	3.9950536996879418

Now , as I said that this will be definitely higher because you are talking about a gas phase reaction or gaseous molecules is converted to a solid whereas , this case it is all liquid monomer you are talking about .	3.197566052405589

Now , let us compare between first styrene and alpha methyl styrene .	3.321253070078974

Obviously this alpha methyl styrene have a much lower del H value .	4.609878008986105

Now , that is because this polymer made from this one one substituted alkynes are going to generate when this five one this s p 2 is converted to s p 3 they are going to give lot of strain .	2.9845990076421742

If this alpha methyl styrene is converted to a polymer obviously because of this presence of this groups the polymer will be much more strained compared to the monomer which is a planer molecules .	4.396457511023506

There is no strain of these groups .	4.928908700301992

So , this happens for most of the one one substituted alkynes .	5.260305927262942

Resulting polymers is have much higher strain compared to if there was no such bulky groups .	3.497509376678632

So , as a result alpha methyl styrene has much lower del H value compared to the styrene .	4.594903595263382

The monomer stabilization is more or same between styrene and alpha methyl styrene .	3.5086327450043187

Similar case for M M A , M M A also a one one substituted and same logic can apply here because these are resulting a strain polymer the del H actually .	2.8904031255469267

The magnitude of del H comes down .	5.522117948667938

You can compare between the values between M A and M M A .	4.063951872324004

If we compare between M A and M M A they are very close .	3.98182936825142

They are close , but M M A is having much lower because in case of one one substituted the strain is much more compared to if have a only one substituted monomer .	3.362562308330713

So , a polymer resulting from M M A will be much more strained compared to a polymer from just methyl acrylate .	4.012754694710849

If you compare between say propyne and acrylonitrile propyne and acrylonitrile , so if you C H 3 and C N .	3.0893740694004475

Obviously resulting polymers which have similar strain .	5.918271323051029

So , it determine the del H value determined by the stabilization of the this double bond .	4.344388008481672

And this case presence of electron withdrawing C N group this will be more stabilized .	3.7150129178767113

So , that value of acrylonitrile polymerization will be lower , so that 76 compared to 84 .	4.555047672730947

So , anything you do to stabilize the double bond it will lower the magnitude of the del H p .	4.044709313267618

If you do anything which will increase the strain in the resulting polymer that will also reduce the decrease in the value of del H .	3.775643182945296

And as decrease in the value of del H which means thermodynamic feasibility will also comes down .	3.599079804568994

We can compare between say one butyne and one tribu butyne .	3.5959755759696583

If you if you compare between the acrylic acid and say acrylonitrile and acrylic acid .	4.171694707780653

Actually can form hydrogen bonding between the molecules which actually stabilizes the molecules lower compared to be when it get converted to polymer .	3.1897505539318045

If its compared polymers this groups cannot line up to form hydrogen bonding .	2.957116430166573

So , the hydrogen bonding in acrylic acid polymer is much lower compared to acrylic acid monomer , which means del H value will be lower for acrylic acid compared to say acrylonitrile .	3.072904695241856

So , we talked about the stabilization of the monomer due to resonance , inductive effect or by hydrogen bonding or dipro interaction between the monomers and increase in the strain behavior of the resulting polymer , which all this factors are against thermodynamic feasibility because the del H value comes down .	3.2236192386841265

Now , the values for tetrafluoroethylene is very high extremely high del H value which is is very difficult to is actually 163 , trifluoroethylene is 163 .	3.842347638393901

Now , that is very high , it is very difficult to explain .	6.455037876664678

It could be due to that resulting polymers have because because have a strong association .	3.1962368870328906

So , this actually goes down because chlorines are induced lot dipole movement .	2.9795667087357134

So , there could be a attractive interaction between the polymer molecule .	6.218574057212485

And in this case that might go down with could results in the increase in the magnetitude of the del H that is one way to explain the high value of del H of high value of magnetitude of del H in case of trifluoroethylene to poly tetrafluoroethylene tetrafluoroethylene to poly tetrafluoroethylene .	3.283223398699931

Now , this value of del H is also important because that dictate you the exothermicity of the reactions .	3.5649833362905183

And if you have some knowledge about the exothermicity then you can actually control your , you can take out the the heat generated .	3.957948688707143

If the heat is , you cannot effectively remove the heat which is getting generated by this exothermic polymer reaction then it will accumulate and it will increase the temperature local temperature .	3.2204309078360778

It will increase the reaction rate and decrease the molecular weight in a uncontrolled way .	5.193031389148622

So , having a knowledge of del H is very important for a chemical engineer .	4.45301219375386

So , that it he can design a process whereby he can effectively remove the heat generated due to the polymer reaction so that reaction remain isothermal during the polymerization process .	2.973014206665238

So , this alpha methyl styrene has a minimum of del H value .	4.444914710975416

Of course , if you go back and see this one if this is low for a given M e , this will be lower because this more or less same .	3.9981062180314217

So , if it this goes down T c also goes down .	3.6685619292442087

If you consider this as a pure monomer , if you fix this concentration pure monomer as this goes down T c goes down .	3.12964959342818

So , which means that for a pure monomer T c is much lower for alpha methyl styrene compared to a styrene which means that alpha methyl styrene cannot be polymerized .	4.480876167641956

Whereas , molecule like styrene can be easily polymerized to a very low equilibrium value of free monomer in the mixture .	4.44100779882778

Now , we have talked about that one one substituted disubstituted monomers also difficult to polymerize .	3.547197304986858

We talked about in the initial lectures when we introduced the radical polymerization about five six lectures back .	3.0327157631198425

For example , if you consider say maleic anhydride , stilbene or say one two simply one two dichloroethylene .	2.7053627568669967

Now , this this monomers have quite significant value of del H , for say for maleic anhydride this is about minus 59 kilojoule per mole , which means it is not the the fact maleic anhydride is very difficult to polymerize .	2.7634221587877694

It is not due to its magnitude its value of del H polymerization .	3.3859754461280396

Now , what is the reason that this monomers are difficult to polymerize ?	4.720756536653242

That is because of you if you have say polymer , a monomer like this where you have substituted one two substituted and you have a radical , if radical approaching this double bond which gets very restricted because of this substitutions .	3.6707548131106886

What is the radical ?	9.885665427726908

This is the radical is get generated this is the propagating radical .	5.841262686490329

Now , when this has to further take part in polymerization it has to approach this monomer .	4.340827804304524

Now , that approach becomes very sterically hindered because of presence of all this one one substitution .	3.30338433184182

And that is the reason this is very difficult and and that is why this reactions are very difficult to carry out .	6.0278715984528

Now , that so we talked about the T c and the values of del H and del S .	4.49950081048697

The R p and X n the molecular weight can be also dependent on the pressure as well , though it is not that significant as temperature .	4.528703269385171

If the change in d R p says del V star by R T , we can write similarly , activation energy in case of temperature .	3.719101116321897

You can write activation volume in case of pressure depending up on the value of this activation .	4.812722147555611

Activation volume is the change in volume from either monomer goes from monomer state to transition state .	3.295808272180561

If the volume is lower in transition state then del V will be negative .	3.0675155658339035

If the volume of the transition state is higher than the monomer volume then del V activation volume will be positive .	3.965023656152662

If this is positive then rate of polymerization will go up with temperature and if its negative if it is negative then it will go down .	4.426138418043092

You can get it from this expression and it is not very significant .	6.523865652451655

And it seldom practice the in the increase in rate of polymerization can be achieved much easily then by increasing the temperature than increasing the pressure .	3.6558791926449996

When you increased your temperature as much as possible even if you do not get a appreciable polymerization rate then people actually increase the polymerization increase the pressure to get a higher polymerization rate .	3.0926499653326873

Now , let us talk about , we will not spend too much time on the effect of the pressure on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight because it is not very significant as I said .	4.15514511158839

That effect of temperature is much more significant .	8.635262547523288

So , you can if you want to increase the polymerization rate you can do it much easier way by increasing the temperature .	4.0505433317939294

If you run out of the option of increasing temperature then people try to increase the pressure to increase the rate of polymerization .	3.490363861065667

Now , let us talk about the molecular weight distribution in case of radical polymerization .	4.596961060792647

If you recollect the value for say your X n say this is your average degrees of polymerization for a thermal initiated polymerization .	3.6615545073992894

Now , with time the value of M and I changes .	6.765555217431057

And changes means decrease , the mono monomer is converted to polymers .	3.632965796462773

The monomer consistent drops as well as the initiator concentration drop .	5.117501874903317

But the drop in initiator concentration is much more compared to drop in monomer concentration .	4.0549807973945775

So , at if you consider these expressions with time goes molecular concentration the monomer drops so as the concentration of the initiator .	3.842728803254172

Now , the drop in I is much sharper compared to drop in M concentration of M , which means that X n the average degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight increases with time .	3.5446311994075796

So , which means that the molecular distribution if you consider the entire reaction is very complicated because at any instantaneous time the the molecular weight is different .	4.067403187164475

One more fundamental difference in case of radical polymerization with the step growth polymerization , I spent some time in lecture probably couple of lecture back .	3.090778328339125

That in case , of step growth polymerization step growth polymerization the polymer is considered the entire mass .	5.220853482899748

You start with a monomer you complete the polymerization reaction .	4.869247171858204

You consider the entire reaction mixture is the polymer , which includes monomers dimmer oligomers and high polymers high molecular weight polymers .	3.642408599162469

So , that entire mixture is your polymer sample .	4.378913347713419

So , the P D I you got one plus P which is for the entire polymer which includes small molecules as well as the high molecular weights .	3.6455114867753

So , how did we get that X n bar remember X n bar was the number of molecules at t is equal to 0 and number of by divided by molecules at end of the polymerization .	3.2305989721849317

We considered all the numbers all the molecules present in at the end of the polymerization which includes monomer dimmer oligomer and everything .	3.2754293279763047

So , which which are considering the small molecules also as a part of polymers and we are getting the polydispersity of 1 plus 3 .	4.2635850572401655

We discusses that during the polymers there could be cyclic reaction formation or the side reaction for which small molecular weight generate which which result in higher P D Ivalue of higher than 2 .	2.6386544674463854

But in case if you getting a P D I value is one point less than 2 for a polymers which you have taken out from the solution which means that the low molecular samples which might have left in the solution .	3.4157049102791843

So , you are getting the polymer precipitate from your reaction mixture devoid of the small molecules .	3.03774616583002

So , basically you were narrowing your distribution .	3.9738083989103794

So , you are getting less than 2 value if you have if you have a less than 2 value .	5.367612273800918

Now , in case of radical polymerization how do we define radical polymerization how do you define the X n is the total total number of monomers reacted , I hope it is all visible this is not very sharpen , by total number of polymer molecules .	3.6415158180566194

Now , these are high molecular weight polymers these are high molecular weight polymers which you isolate after the reactions .	3.7710147558951945

So , this does not contain the unreacted monomer .	5.015083070334704

So , that is the fundamental difference between X n in case of radical polymerization and in X n in case of step growth polymerization .	3.916355293720242

Now , in in case of step growth polymers X n is considered at the end of the reaction .	4.335744760286508

So , X n will vary with the time .	4.86934629782287

What is the value of X n for radical chain polymerization ?	5.208622711165409

We will not go into very details into derivation .	3.892475391042056

Now , these are for for case if one polymer is formed from one kinetic chain which means termination by disproportionation or by transfer this is apply to this .	2.7979956333478526

Now , this case P is probability that the propagating radical will continue to propagate and build polymer .	3.1298734791945964

P is not the conversion unlike step growth P is not a conversion here .	5.126167128617911

It should be given by the ratio of rate of propagation with rate of propagation plus rate of termination plus rate of transfer .	5.153291660007824

What is the probability , is the probability given by the rates rate of propagation divided by total rates which is summation of propagation plus termination plus transfer .	3.5718516578077515

Because , it is making high polymer high molecular weight polymer that means it is undergoing more times of propagating reaction than a terminating reaction or a transfer reaction which means probability is close to 1 .	2.7294846792792926

Now , if for for a polymer getting for polymers getting terminated by combination that means one polymer is getting formed from two kinetic chain .	2.8739838794192125

Obviously , the distribution will be the narrower and the molecular weight will be higher .	5.4232424743879415

So , X n is 2 by instead of 1 by 1 P is 2 by 1 p and X w is 2 plus P 1 minus P .	3.05778795658333

So , P D I is 2 plus P by 2 .	5.865073848879253

So , this these are remember this at low conversion we are talking about reaction has just started .	3.8459536363336566

Reaction has not progressed too much so the concentration of monomer and concentration of initiator has not changed much .	3.5417869326859477

So , ration of monomer by I to the power half is this ration has not changed much , at low conversion it will not change much .	3.330442999933914

So , the molecular weight , the average number of degrees of polymerization the weight average degrees of polymerization and the P D I is given by this expressions .	4.629431265150687

I am not going in detail in derivation of this process is complicated process .	3.336466863975572

Whereas , P is given the probability of the propagation radical will continue to propagate and build polymer which is R p divided R p plus R t and are transfer , where if the polymer is terminated by combination reaction than this gives by this .	2.7673461401636623

And as I said for high molecular weight polymer P is 1 .	4.669621453383175

So , the P D I value will be between this is 1.5 to the case where we have termination by this propagation of transfer this 2 .	3.9539554736128006

Now if the reaction continues the , this value changes and is actually it is become higher because the drop in as I said drop in initiator concentration is much faster compared to drop in monomer concentration .	2.929089533341397

So , the chain length the degrees of polymerization goes up .	5.92493654579195

So , if you consider the total polymerization so obliviously , the broadness will be much higher .	3.4647654640081282

The reaction , the polymers made at the begin will be lower molecular weight comparatively lower molecular weight .	3.3419681643222976

And have if you increase the temperature .	7.259950010630703

So , you have a much more broader polymer distribution .	5.852970022933807

So , if you at the end of the polymerization if you consider the M w by M n value will be quite high and its typically between 2 to 5 .	3.991735227834594

You understand that a low conversion it is , it was between 1.52 to 2 , but at the temperature as the time goes up the polymer molecular weights increases increases .	3.858837629144854

So , that distribution actually goes up .	5.246956381223284

Starting from low molecular weight at the beginning to high molecular weights at the at the end thE distribution goes up .	3.7102568538000837

So , you typically the value of P D I comes around 2 to 5 .	4.816098372399154

And if there are gel effect effect like gel effect and all this things were molecular weight shoots up at the end because the reason we talked about in the last class it could end up a P D I value of 5 to 10 .	2.999576753679827

If there are gel effect then what happen you know that branching might happened and if branching happen between or the which results from chain transfer two polymer .	2.6316079172996902

If intermolecular chain transfer happen then the P D I goes up further .	3.6937337120458777

For inter intra polymer chain transfer there is no change in molecular weight or molecular weight distribution either .	4.311562982380162

So , if the there are branching happening because of inter molecular chain transfer as gel effect then P D I goes up and it could be as high as 20 to 50 .	3.047707813897533

Basically , these are not the polymers you want you want polymers which are as narrower as possible .	4.171654037790267

So , that is why you would like to avoid this gel effect and and branching and and so on .	3.2813542945486147

So , that you can get narrower and this is the most typical values of P D I you get from a normal polymerization radical polymerization reaction .	3.9883293449461563

Now , what , I will talk about that we talked about the effect of temperature , thermodynamics of polymer , different molecular weight distribution .	4.759775696472414

Now , talked about how the polymers are done you know .	5.596070446032021

We talked about all the theory and principle behind molecular weights rates and all this .	2.8814095980344923

Now , the practical part how the monomers are usually polymerized in a in a industry scenario or in the lab .	3.567509799150764

There could be several processes .	5.884734272556536

You can do the polymerization only with a monomer and we call it a bulk polymerization .	5.155389857494451

You can dissolve the monomer in a solvent and do the polymerization then it is named as solution polymerization .	4.394875738092105

You can disperse the monomers in aqueous phase and do the polymerization , you call this suspension polymerization .	4.004172384047664

We call that as a dispersion polymerization .	6.2402605053909275

And you can do the polymerization in emulsion as well .	5.475138515059466

We talk about of each of this brief .	5.622130665795651

We will spend most time on emulsion polymerization and so let us start about the bulk polymerization .	3.7492480576163305

As I said is the most simple or the simplest polymerization .	3.960685242098523

So , you take the monomer you dissolve the initiator and heat the monomer to start the or to initiate the reaction .	3.5622587409276387

And obviously , what is advantage here ?	5.111097174058252

Advantage is that we have seen that the reaction polymer polymer reaction rate as well as the molecular weight goes up with increase in monomer concentration , which is not true for increasing initiator concentration for initiator increase in initiator concentration rate goes up , but the molecular weight comes down .	4.034193042078175

If you remember that discussion we had just few few minutes .	3.6248092370367666

But monomer actually , if you increase the monomer both the reaction rate and the molecular weight goes up and this is the maximum concentration you can do .	5.851702055441899

You can get maximum concentration monomer if you do in a pure state , so monomer concentration is high .	4.056716997564661

And that can be applied in optical applications like C D E and you know other things where you require very clean polymers .	3.103858146748769

Obviously , this has lot of disadvantages .	5.9672100220693896

For example , because your concentration is very high even at low concentration even at low conversion the viscosity goes up because the medium viscous if the polymer is viscosity goes up .	3.5316554792650003

And as the viscosity goes up you cannot start the reaction medium very effectively and if you cannot start you cannot dissipate the heat generated due to exothermic polymerization .	3.3155123123437797

And as a result what happened , you there is a local heat generation which actually can degrade your polymers which actually can degrade the polymer molecules and can generate coloration in your polymers .	3.0949965925477345

So , viscosity becomes high and stirring become difficult .	3.927602013382633

And at the end of the polymer also polymerization also , if the viscosity of the resulting you are your final polymer is very high then processing also becomes very difficult .	3.5514400035888034

So , heat generation is high rate and as a result local heat formation takes place coloration and degradation takes place .	3.144137704322827

So , what is done it is still done ?	4.651772559403902

It is still utilized for say making styrene , poly styrene , poly methyl acrylate , poly vinyl chloride .	2.7182613306959187

Typically , what is done you start the reaction and keep it at low conversion so that build up is not too high not unmanageable .	3.735099751187787

Then stop the reaction take out the polymer and restart the reaction again .	5.681752002750264

So , that you can get high molecular weight , high rate of polymerization without building very high viscosity .	5.107977300635927

So , you have to do actually stop starts stop start stop reaction where you start the reactions stop at low conversion and then you stop and take the polymer out .	3.112371042712879

Another strategy is taken for making sheets and all this things that you make a pre - polymer which is not very high molecular weight .	3.886955110102412

You make a p polymer so the viscosity is not high and then that pre - polymer is poured into a mold in this case sheet .	2.970836007810941

And then you you want to get the polymer in a final form of a sheet .	5.772192357653638

So , you pour that pre - polymer into the sheet and then without starting you do the reaction .	2.803926620039182

So , the reaction rate will be faster and high molecular weight produced and it will you do not need to process it .	4.4388935895462955

It will , it will become like a sheet .	6.2060477208956355

So , you do not you are not aiming for processing this thing or you are not aiming for for heat management all this things .	2.805324214006412

You are not targeting that .	6.17241019832629

You are taking this pre - polymer putting in a sheet type mold and then finishing the polymerization .	2.4939646066420207

You actually , gel effect is a beneficial for this thing .	3.8304181853693677

So , these are the things these are strategies are applied for in industry for using bulk polymerization .	2.791458968648294

We move to solution polymerization where you have require monomer solvent and a soluble solvent soluble initiator .	3.2753844461271497

In this case , you require initiator to be in the solvent and free radical kinetic normal can be applied .	3.9351446651504025

It could be homogeneous , if the polymer formed remain in in the solution it will be heterogeneous .	5.230714856034088

If the polymer is insoluble and precipitate out once it forms and once it precipitate outs it can form powder or granular .	2.9268815530407886

So , sometimes this this polymerization is called powder or granular polymerization .	3.7554365170630684

For example , acrylonitrile in bulk or acrylonitrile in water in this case , it should be water .	4.455754827551446

If you start polymerization acrylonitrile in water , poly acrylonitrile is not solvable in water , so its precipitated out you get acrylonitrile powder or granular .	2.247910265133991

Obviously , advantage the advantage disadvantage which we had for your bulk polymerization .	3.3137571969921646

In this case , you do not have those problems because you are doing in a solution then heat heat transfer can takes place efficiently because it is solution viscosity does not build up .	3.204169625099433

So , there is no question of local heat formation , local spot formation , hot spot formation and degradation of molecules and thermal control becomes easier .	2.598731632022015

Now , what is disadvantage obviously you are doing a solutions of monomer concentration goes down which means rate of polymerization becomes lower and molecular weight becomes lower .	3.642476932814257

And unless if you do not choose the solvent very carefully the solvent can participate in chain transfer reaction , reduce your molecular weight further , so you have to be very careful .	3.9216176144920087

Now of course , sometimes is very difficult to remove the solvent quantitatively from the polymer no matter how much vacuum you applied it is very difficult some times because solvents stick to the polymer .	2.774609426290218

So , it is sometimes very difficult to take out all the solvents from the polymer quantitively .	4.183369231631237

And that is very detrimental for the properties of the you know final polymers , you do not want solvent to be contaminating your polymers .	3.209861617966765

Now of course , you cannot throughout all the solvents unit solvent recovery and recyclic which is a very hazardous for this .	3.0958533445072582

We are talking about organic solvent , so it is not very environmental friendly and the person scientist finally either .	3.815168142904563

You know we not want somebody working in the lab with the huge amount of organic solvent that is health hazardous well as the environmental hazardous .	2.6912500189602455

These are the disadvantage for a solution polymerization , but still use for making polyethylene poly acrylonitrile or polyethylene acetate .	2.613376107479704

There is a third type of polymerization we talking about where is a heterogeneous polymerization it could be suspension or dispersion .	3.880096260470029

In case of , suspension monomer and monomer soluble water suspension polymers are nothing but bulk polymerization done in in small volumes .	2.794874904881858

You make this small volumes of bulk polymers distributed in a or dispersed in a aqueous solution .	2.829700637732571

So , all the disadvantage of the bulk polymers should not be present here because you are doing in a small small volumes and small droplets and because its present in a in a surrounded by aqueous medium .	3.0993519781072134

So , heat dispersion heat dissipation is easy , viscosity is does not build up its not a problem .	2.9074012201442536

What you do , you dissolve take your monomer dissolve the initiator in the monomer and then on that you add your dispersing medium which is already heated in the temperature you want to do your reaction .	3.358922815529337

So , you take the monomer along with your initiator you add the preheated dispersing medium and then reversely start .	2.9631317708458775

Once , you start this monomers containing the initiator will form droplets .	3.494350074151736

And it will remain dispersed because you have added in that reaction medium and dispersions which are typically water soluble polymers like polyethylene glycol or some inorganic particles which actually get absorbed on this particles and prevent them to coulis .	2.718043237920083

So , that they remain in the as a dispersion form because you have this soluble water soluble polymers or the ionic particles which actually act as a stabilizer for this droplets .	3.296774765432155

So , what you do initially , you initiate is dissolved in the monomer and then preheated dispersing minimum added .	3.55870889751658

And vigorous starting converts the monomer containing initiator into strong small droplets of 100 to 500 microns , and because dispersant presence which are very small amount 0.1 weight percent .	2.64101112537853

And because you are continually stirring this actually stabilized the suspension , so the poly .	3.134131992736871

Now , you have the monomer droplets along with the initiator molecules has a small droplets which are dispersed in the aqueous solution .	4.169683069755076

Now , you are doing the bulk polymerization in the small droplets .	6.060904093430441

So , all the advantages of bulk polymerization is remain still intact high polymerization rate , high molecular weight , very pure monomers .	2.969809818732856

And once the polymerization is complete you can just filter out and get the final polymers in a beads form .	3.8732768109905966

That is why some times it call as a bead or a pearl polymerization .	3.1272308291923467

So , you can remain maintain all the advantages of the high polymer bulk polymerization and you can get the polymers by filtration as a beads .	3.2746727656961103

Now , these beads should not stick which other .	3.86456163073454

It should be rigid if you want to isolate these polymers as a bead then it should be rigid and it should not stick to each other .	3.461798065515826

The temperature you are taking out if your glass transition temperature your polymer is close to that room temperature or little higher than the polymer will be soft .	4.190562145899279

So , this methods is typically applied for the polymers which have the high glass transition temperature like methyl methacrylate and all this things .	4.084901282245074

So , we will start from this point and talk about the dispersion polymerization and emulsion polymerization in the next lecture .	3.8712326281433223

Today we shall discuss the performance of enzyme catalyzed reactors , the reactors in which enzyme catalyzed reactions are supposed to take place.You will recall earlier we had discussed some of the salient features of different reactor types ranging from batch reactors , batch stirred tank reactors to continuous stirred tank reactor or plug flow reactors and fluidized bed reactors .	2.714990822148136

In fact some of the unusual reactor configurations which have been proposed to catalyze to be used for carrying out enzyme catalyzed reaction like hollow fiber reactors also arbitrarily fall into one of those categories of plug flow or CSTR which were discussed .	2.8703738465886337

We had also seen earlier the factors that affect the choice of different reactor types and to recall some of the factors that we had talked about the most important ones are listed here like form of the enzyme .	3.55855528760734

That is soluble , fibrous or particulate .	4.738366953447586

The nature of the substrate whether it is soluble , particulate or colloidal , operational requirements ; the control of pH in case an acid is produced or consumed in the reaction , reaction kinetics , carrier loading capacity , catalytic surface to reactor volume ratio , mass transfer characteristics , ease of catalyst replacement and regeneration , reactor cost and ease of fabrication .	2.5252959619931716

All these factors that I have listed here can be considered mainly under two categories .	3.7631415627367173

One category contains the factor which becomes fixed once an immobilized enzyme is prepared .	3.873527092524147

That means the factors that are dictated by the immobilization enzyme preparation itself .	4.292523480120732

For example form of the enzyme ; the nature of the substrate is also fixed .	7.206270992206362

Once the enzymatic reaction is defined the nature of substrate is fixed .	5.860987873246012

The operational requirement is also fixed depending upon the nature of the enzyme catalyzed reaction whether an acid is produced or consumed and pH control is a requirement .	3.3511074513098453

Similarly the catalytic surface to volume ratio is also fixed once an immobilized enzyme preparation is available .	3.4976533939513335

The carrier loading capacity also depends on the bulk density of the immobilized enzyme preparation and things like that .	3.9553692820965987

Ease of catalyst replacement and reactor cost and ease of fabrication are the factors which are dependent on the type of enzyme reactor .	3.3759562521527773

But the two important class of factors which I wanted to point out here is one is reaction kinetics and mass transfer characteristics .	2.931383700023779

I would once again point out that we have knowingly ignored heat transfer requirements assuming that for most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction the rate of reaction is very , very small and so heat transfer during the reaction is not a major critical factor .	3.700836273663026

In certain cases if it is so , the heat transfer characteristics also must be taken into account .	3.3906574462309322

Last time I was taking we had also considered certain idealized reactor design parameter .	2.975873677420336

That means for design of a particular type of reactor what kind of design parameters are important and you will recall that we had also hypothesized certain conditions or assumptions which define an idealized enzyme reactor system and the assumptions were that isothermal operation , ?	2.5906765230518025

H is very small , uniform enzyme distribution , plug flow behavior or completely back mix behavior , that means you have one of the extreme fluid dynamics in the reactor system .	3.828212312082673

Either it is a plug flow motion or it is a completely back mix and nothing in between .	5.310523665983983

That is what we have assumed and there are no mass transfer limitations and no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase .	3.3865454634974843

These are the basic assumptions which define our ideal enzyme reactor and the reactor design parameters .	4.291488048246004

That means the parameter which we should define initially before we go on to design any particular reactor was “tau ” , the space time in the reactor ; initial substrate concentration , enzyme loading , E0 .	3.1686249930705603

In the case of continuous operation , the information about the deactivation rate constant is also required , kd .	3.8996027886553186

Then the temperature of operation , pH control and these are the reaction conditions .	4.8027875781288385

Other design parameters are fractional conversion and productivity and reactor capacity .	3.9967965150887586

That is the maximum reaction capacity assuming that the enzyme reaction follows a maximum reaction velocity , that is zero order profile and the productivity of that kind of the reactor will be your reaction capacity .	3.982853524652331

Ultimately the performance will be dictated very heavily by enzyme kinetics .	3.649666092282286

If we consider …. .. enzyme reactor we can safely say that Michaelis Menten kinetics provides us a basis for carrying out a universally accepted kinetics for enzyme catalyzed reactions and so therefore we will assume in most cases v is equal to v = k2E0S / Km + S Wherever we are talking of immobilized enzyme we must also clearly understand that these two terms k2 and Km are denoted by prime indicating only that they are immobilized enzyme parameters and not the soluble parameters .	2.811131128191887

The first and probably the most simplest reactors is the batch reactors .	3.2869759682395343

The substrate concentration drops and ultimately depending upon the extent of conversion which we require , the product concentration increases .	3.8235179813434015

A typical profile ; it can change from reaction to reaction .	3.879787686659513

If the reaction is very strongly inhibited by products or strongly inhibited by substrates the profile might undergo a change .	3.1283005034054043

One of the probably very general features of analyzing the reactor performance as you may be aware is material balance across the reactor .	3.321594707615714

You take material balance for one of the reaction species say substrate and make a material balance ; simplify it .	4.253981999964286

Do mathematical steps and you will arrive at the reactor performance equations which will give you the performance of reactor .	4.757592916166686

When I say performance of reactor I mean the extent of conversion as a function of space time or in a batch reactor with the reaction time .	3.889181027749094

In the case of a batch reactor the reactor performance can be just simplified integrated form of the reaction equation and that is - ds / dt = k2.E0 Km / S + 1 Typical Michaelis Menten equation .	4.08484349594227

Even when we write integrated form of equation we can assume that this is also valid if you make a material balance across the batch reactor because the classical material balance equation requires that input minus output minus conversion should be equal to accumulation .	2.976840063669581

Here in the case of a batch reactor the accumulation is volume multiplied by rate of change of substrate concentration that is –v.ds / dt .	4.027990428683418

Only initially we feed the reactor and at the end of the reaction time the output is taken out .	3.9539529845931627

There is no continuous output or input in the system and the conversion is given by the rate of reaction .	4.461067976014794

So v into rate of reaction is the total accumulation and the conversion factor and by canceling the volume term from both the sides you can arrive at the integrated form of the equation and this equation if you integrate , it will lead to the reactor performance equation .	3.3728666645877885

If you just simplify it , you will get Km ln S0 / S + S0 - S = k2.E0.t Again I like to repeat that in case if we are using a batch reactor for immobilized enzymes we should replace Km and k2 by prime terms .	3.382836643419125

This is equation 1 and this is equation 2 .	8.828577860512521

If you want to describe the equations in terms of reactor performance then X is equal to S0 - S X = = 1 - S / S0 ; S / S0 = 1 - X S0 So if you substitute all these parameters you get in terms of reactor performance equation for a batch reactor in the form of fractional conversion that is XS0 + K ’ mln 1 / 1 - X = k ’ 2E0t The reaction performance equation for a batch reactor if we want in the terms of product concentration , product concentration is nothing else but P = S0 - S assuming that its a unimolecular reaction .	3.336313107043256

If in case you are handling with a different kind of a reaction scheme let us say one mole of substrates goes into two moles of products then accordingly one has to make a change in the definition of X as well as P .	3.623138201555218

This will be equal to P = S0 - S = XS0 Therefore you can also write in terms of product concentration KmlnS0 / S0 + P = k ’ 2E0t If you look at these equations you can use the reactor performance data of a batch reactor .	4.1773925732119706

That means you take a single batch performance data ; take the maximum conversion at different times of reaction .	2.9123047946628073

You can write down the expression ln S0 / S 1 k ’ 2E0t + = S0 - S Km K ’ m ( S0 - S ) From the equation two if you just simplify you get a straight line equation which can give the values of Km and vm .	3.4980136387051157

If you plot let us say ln ( S0 - S ) / S0 - S and t / S0 - S , you get the slope of k ’ 2E0 / K ’ m and with the intercept as - 1 / K ’ m Sorry .	4.579203135500267

X - axis is lnS0 / S .	8.340603501564715

This provides you one of the simple methods .	6.8500291156844995

When we immobilize enzymes if we monitor the kinetics parameters Km and vm , the simple way to measure the kinetic constants for an immobilized enzyme reaction will be to carry out the reaction in a batch stirred reactor .	3.4143385026974586

Monitor the substrate concentration or fraction of conversion with reference to time and determine the parameters by a single reactor performance data .	3.888826652284437

That provides us a simple tool , batch reactor for small scale laboratory experiments to determine the kinetic parameters both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme .	3.4064411977680615

Here I must again put a caution .	5.180859981152024

When we used the Michaelis Menten equation you will recall that we had made certain assumptions and the assumptions were that we are talking of the initial reaction rate .	3.079265844340897

That means at a time equal to zero .	4.960994627978167

Whereas when we integrate the equation from zero to time t let us say to a conversion factor of 90 % or 95 % or 99 % , the reaction rate is not likely to remain the same as that of the initial time .	3.216327143215343

So here we are violating some of the basic assumptions of the Michaelis Menten equation .	4.495704604752576

But still it gives you a very approximate situation for designing a reactor or making some design calculations to work out reactor size or the capacity of the reactor , accepting that and even compare between soluble enzyme and immobilized enzyme but otherwise under idealistic conditions , the assumptions in the Michaelis Menten equation that of the initial reaction rate , absence of product division is not met here .	2.4397070756442485

So when we apply the integrated Michaelis Menten equation for looking at the performance of an immobilized enzyme reactor in the batch mode we must keep in mind that it only gives you an approximate situation just to tell the sizing of the vessels required for a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction and to compare the soluble enzyme with that of immobilized enzyme performance .	3.3126323331947125

Even while looking at the kinetics of the soluble enzyme we always look at the situations when it comes to extreme substrate conditions .	3.680510893242728

That means either when the substrate concentration is much , much smaller than Km or when it is much higher than Km .	3.873943782765156

That means it ranges from first order to zero order regime .	3.4290036920903137

How the reactor performance will change ?	9.240141719453835

For example when substrate concentration is much , much smaller than K ’ m , reactor performance becomes - K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0t When S0 is much , much greater than K ’ m that is zero order regime .	2.825535604103088

XS0 = k ’ 2E0t If suppose you approximate an enzyme reactor to follow either a zero order or a first order regime , knowing the values of Km and k2 the error involved in that will be determined by the ratio of Km / S0 .	3.4581701894918395

If the ratio of Km / S0 is very , very small you will hardly incur any error if you assume it to be a first order .	3.8073117133821497

When we go on to consider along with the reaction kinetics we consider mass transfer and all more complications we will tend to approximate our reactor performance in either zero order or first order regime rather than making it a Michaelis Menten equation which might make the solution of the expressions more difficult or it can be done by any numerical methods .	2.8939126356825944

But analytical solutions may be difficult .	5.900154393973816

We make an assumption depending upon the range in which our substrate concentration exists in relation to Km value .	3.1180739431877273

The error involved will increase if you increase the ratio of Km to S0 and you assume a first order because then both will go towards the zero order kinetics .	3.2466008321095505

If the Km to S0 ratio increases and you assume a first order kinetics error will keep on increasing .	3.1051191672903555

Km is much , much larger than the S0 in the first order .	5.179584665424759

So the value of Km / S0 will be larger .	5.808226543776491

In fact one can make a hypothetical computation and then we take up an assignment to design an enzyme reactor or for that matter any process equipment .	3.135658340518151

If you are going to measure let us say the value of Km or vm , you need an accurate value .	4.1831067764214165

But when you want to go for design , let us say a reaction capacity ; what is the volume of the reactor required to carry out this conversion ?	4.521522177475491

You are not going to be very specific that this is the volume required .	7.4415234489311795

You will add on to that about 10 % open added space or for various purposes .	3.0939056329212082

So if let us say the error involved is less than 10 % , I think there is no harm in making an assumption of zero order or first order .	3.393721024415899

If the error involved is much larger then our assumptions will be slightly hazardous .	3.249316286280902

The next simple form of reactor system which is commonly employed is a continuous stirred tank reactor .	3.4109110663106974

In the continuous stirred tank reactor one is a continuous flow reactor .	4.284262734993857

That means the feed rate of the substrate is same as the output rate of the product stream .	6.426815863248329

So if the feed is added at the flow rate of “F ” let us say litres or moles per unit time , what ever unit you follow , the volume remains the constant .	2.779292340280196

Substrate concentration S0 , changes at the exit .	5.598195916150749

But one of the characteristic features is that all the parameters at the exit stream are same as in the reactor itself .	5.225723600482391

That means the reaction will take place under conditions of S , P or X which exist at the exit stream .	3.1249959504215634

Therefore if you just write a material balance for such a reactor system you can write accumulation as V.ds / dt = FS0 –FS – v.V FS0 is the input ; S is the substrate concentration in the outlet and v is the reaction velocity that is the conversion due to the reaction and V is the reactor volume .	3.9739072762511336

Consider that after a certain period of time the reactor comes under steady state situation .	3.724900508498277

When we say steady state situation it means that the concentration of any species does not change with time in the outlet stream .	4.090863350051301

Under that condition the accumulation term will tend to be zero because whatever material is coming in , either it is getting converted to do reaction or it is going out of the reactor .	3.1393805146364966

There is no accumulation of any species in the system and therefore one can write k ’ 2E0S v = D ( S0 - S ) = K ’ m + S D is the term here what we understand as dilution rate or F / V or in other words V / F is the resistance time , inverse of space time .	3.0411385694916855

So this D is the term and you can also write k ’ 2E0S S0 - S = K ’ m + S ?	4.55490563561274

That is your space time that was defined in the earlier expressions .	3.853417524282876

Solving these equations you can also get k ’ 2E0 ?	6.831620249058994

= S0X + K ’ m ( X / 1 - X ) That gives you a reactor performance for a CSTR and from the substrate concentration if you make a substitution for X , you arrive at detector performance for CSTR .	3.6786810947274646

Similarly here also if you make assumptions of zero order or first order situation when K ’ m is much , much smaller than S0 , that is a zero order system ?	3.2967065563697218

= XS0 / k ’ 2S0 For first order system where K ’ m is much , much greater than S0 , you have K ’ m ( X / 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 ?	2.7207530530197404

. Second expression is ?	8.209275033085094

= XS0 / k ’ 2E0 .	8.83658174255064

So you get the two expressions for CSTR the general reactor performance expression and also under conditions of zero order and first order scenario .	3.033446362185999

The expressions are very simple and if you have the data available for any reactor performance for S0 , fraction of conversion required , you can determine the volume of the reactor required or the feed rate required depending on the tau and one can make computation to define the reactor performance under given conditions .	3.7222094954523586

The other idealized reactor or which is what we understand as the plug flow is slightly typical in the sense that unlike in the case of a CSTR , the concentration of the substrate or the product vary along the length of the reactor .	3.3251880598568184

So making a material balance across the reactor you cannot choose any concentration term because the concentration term for substrate changes with the length of the reactor and the concentration of the substrate or product is not constant throughout the reactor .	3.529681188014033

It varies ; that means if you consider along the length of the reactor , kind of a batch reactor with different reaction times but to arrive at the reactor performance what we can do is we can make a material balance across a differential element of the plug flow reactor and if we consider differential element of volume d v you can make your material balance say under same conditions like the feed flow rate as “F ” , the conversion changes from X to X + ?	3.0080789632976717

X at the inlet X is equal to zero at the outlet X has some value .	3.8109617868911165

If you consider here input to the system is F.S and this input I am writing at the entry of the differential element and output , not at the entry of the reactor , is equal to F ( S + dS ) and the disappearance of the substrate by the reaction will be the continuation of the reaction to the disappearance of the substrate is –v. ( dV ) Under these conditions one can write the material balance under steady state assuming that the accumulation is zero .	3.1977611675889723

F.S = F ( S + dS ) + ( - v ) .dV One can simplify it to get F.dS = v.dV Here for the fraction of conversion X = S0 - S / S0 ; dS = - S0dX F.S0.dX = - v.dV You can integrate this and the integrated form will give you the zero to v dv / FS0 which will be equal to zero to X dX / - v or V / FS0 because feed rate is constant , substrate concentration is constant and so the definite integral will come to V / FS0 and that is ?	2.739574526035753

/ S0 which is equal to zero to X dX / - v .	4.651119258923447

If you look at the performance of a plug flow reactor you ultimately arrive at or transfer the S0 to here so tau is equal to S0.dX / - v .	2.7768294561924405

That is the reaction rate .	10.405118919522495

So the performance will be almost identical to that of a batch reactor excepting with the difference that the reaction time here is replaced by the space time and the reactor performance therefore on the same lines you can write as S0X – K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 e ?	3.4189225244493047

Epsilon , while in the case of a stirred bed reactor , is taken to be one .	4.093833319993828

I was just trying to define the term what I introduced here as epsilon .	3.3808259424403686

In the case of a batch stirred reactor we have not considered epsilon because the quantity of enzyme or the volume of enzyme in the reactor is negligible compared to the total volume of the reactor .	3.8797831933462272

A very small fraction of the total volume is occupied by the enzyme preparation .	6.264334047216778

On the other hand in the case of a packed bed reactor a significant fraction of the volume of the reactor is occupied by the packed bed and the volume occupied by the fluid or the feed substrate is only the wide volume of the reactor and therefore the volume occupied by the feed in the reactor is considered as the actual reactor volume .	3.5859811381482807

This tau term has been defined earlier as V / F ; in the case of a packed bed reactor we define tau as eV / F .	3.2101876606676245

That is for CSTR or for a stirred batch reactor the magnitude of epsilon is one .	4.027368381513238

So this gives you the reactor performance for a plug flow reactor following Michaelis Menten kinetics .	4.316390766328615

The same analysis as we did earlier if you consider for zero order kinetics the tau is equal to ?	3.7329156853027565

= XS0 / k ’ 2E0e For first order , tau is equal to ?	3.928649716508047

= - K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) / k ’ 2E0e A very important feature which I like to recall is the relative performance equations for zero order regime for both CSTR as well as for PFR , which are identical .	3.542405783751866

If you look at the equation number two here for the CSTR and the equation for the zero order regime here in the case of the PFR , they are identical .	3.38142981933722

That means the fluid dynamics in the reactor whether it is a back mix system or its a plug flow system does not influence the reactor performance as long as the reaction is in the zero order regime or the concentration of the substrate is much , much higher than the Km value and you must appreciate that if it is in our limits we will always like to use a very high substrate concentration .	3.943687851491072

If the system doesn ’ t undergo substrate inhibition that is if it undergoes inhibition , we have no choice other than to using a lower substrate concentration .	2.5256313175206735

There are two things one will always like to have a high substrate concentration for a reaction ; for commercial purposes also we like to have a very high fraction of conversion and one would like to carry out the reaction almost to conversion levels of ninety five percent plus so as to achieve a complete conversion of substrate as much as possible so that the recovery and the purification stages are simplified or the product stream can be used as it is for end applications .	3.066521501430159

So the only difference lies in the case of reactor performance of plug flow reactor .	5.121804805935844

Consider a first order regime where K ’ m is much , much greater than S0 .	4.185191162746897

In the case of CSTR , you have the reactor performance as K ’ m ( X / 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 ?	4.218454682292496

In the case of PFR , the expression changes to K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 e ?	3.055065710749317

Our interest will always be to have a high fractional conversion .	4.967127739687676

If we want to compare the performance of both CSTR and PFR as I mentioned in the case of zero order regime there is no change and the performance remains identical .	4.239557610252284

But if you consider the first order regime the performance are quite different and if you compare the relative performance , relative quantity of the enzyme required that is ECSTR , the quantity of enzyme required in CSTR and PFR relative quantities or we can define this term as Erel will be equal to ECSTR / EPFR = Erel = - X e / ( 1 - X ) ln ( 1 - X ) The relative quantity of enzyme required in the case of CSTR and PFR under first order regime can be given by this expression .	3.0010452429100685

You notice in this expression that higher the required conversion level , higher the relative amount of the enzyme required in the CSTR .	3.767754401519858

You can just hypothetically put some values of let us say a safe value for epsilon for a typical packed bed reactor varies from between 0.4 to0.5 .	2.6817338177681664

You take a simple value of 0.5 and if you make calculation for X = 0.90 , the Erel required will be equal to 4.5 .	3.885826867185229

That means the enzyme required for the same fractional conversion that is 90 % in the case of a CSTR will be 4.5 times more than that required in the PFR for the same conversion .	4.045972364742031

The same enzyme , the same reaction , the same conversion factor but the quantity of enzyme required in CSTR will be much , much higher compared to PFR .	3.6655113430070427

The inference I want to arrive at is that higher the fractional conversion required for a particular reaction under first order regime , the relative quantity of the enzyme required in the CSTR will drastically increase .	3.8567919313264256

That means even for certain reasons if you want to use CSTR pH control is a requirement and we are obliged to use CSTR , then it is always advisable only to use if the fraction of conversion required is not very high .	3.183878103364679

You can have facility for pH control with some inconvenience ; may be some more additional equipments has to be added but still that will be better because the quantity of the enzyme required will be much less and that gives us a significant advantage for using immobilized enzyme in PFR and that is one of the reasons why you will notice in the literature that almost about 70 - 80 % of the total reports which appear on the use of the immobilized enzymes are in a plug flow reactors and the advantage lies in the quantity of the enzyme required and this advantage will keep on reducing .	3.213921458553339

That is the relative quantity will keep on reducing if the shift is from first order to zero order ultimately it will reach to same quantity .	2.7883823238953322

If we take the value of Km / S0 from a very high value to a very low value , the relative quantity of the enzyme will also keep on reducing and it will become equal to the relative enzyme value , Erel and will become one .	3.9252328364408906

Then the value of S0 is much , much higher than Km .	6.15689558246008

A typical profile for relative quantity required is shown here .	4.149304036070482

As you notice here what ever I mentioned , it signifies the same thing .	3.2350658238508294

There are two things to be looked at .	4.398003968272669

One is the relative quantity of substrate to Km .	5.384961908928437

Here instead of Km / S0 I plotted S0 / Km .	5.768127936484607

The top profile , the first profile indicates a very low value of S0 / Km which means a first order regime .	3.800913298212357

That means as the fractional conversion increases , the relative quantity required also increases and towards the final stages of the fractional conversion , the quantity very significantly goes up .	3.0247195448130513

On the other hand you also see when you come to S0 / Km as hundred approaching towards zero order regime the quantities remain almost equal all through , till you arrive at 90 plus or more than 95 % fractional conversion .	2.4306688386068083

One can have such a profile and when one wants to analyze the reactor performance for any given immobilized enzyme system , one must really characterize a system with reference to such kind of profiles so that one can get a feel of the substrate concentration required and the fractional conversion required , one can choose where to bank upon .	2.7737971987708954

For example in the earlier phases let us say up to 90 % , there is no major gain in using PFR .	3.7392246213519638

But if you want to use a fraction of conversion much higher than 90 % then the PFR becomes more and more matter of choice .	4.314357475705816

Then the immobilization will be identical .	5.984202338904406

Your choice should depend upon the operational convenience .	5.720862718147353

For example if the pH control is required CSTR is preferable and then the nature of the substrate , the nature of the enzyme and the form of the enzyme .	4.995510194643122

If suppose your substrate is colloidal , we will prefer to use CSTR rather than the PFR ; it will choke .	2.9189296013494346

The pressure drop will continuously keep on increasing .	4.604552484556162

If suppose the enzyme particles are in the form of fibers or spherical beads , it is easier to pack them rather than putting in the CSTR where there might be abrasion .	2.858645474824425

The kinetics will not be dictating .	9.20990455752275

So far we have not considered the inhibition patterns .	4.686418002710623

We have not considered the behaviour of the reactor performance if the enzyme undergoes inhibition kinetics .	4.2057905881348905

That means either a substrate inhibition or a product inhibition or a third inhibitor an external inhibitor available in that .	2.798635707098705

All these parameters particularly the inhibitors , rather their inhibition pattern , their deactivation pattern , the mass transfer requirements , the mass transfer limitations and the non - ideal flow behavior ; these are the four things .	3.150986824842578

So far we have been talking assuming that the enzyme reactors are ideal in performance and they are following Michaelis Menten type of kinetics .	3.4334459982429766

At best the extremes of those cases under zero and first order but we have not considered the inhibition pattern , we have not considered the deactivation kinetics , mass transfer limitations and non - ideal flow behavior .	2.768970908065875

That is we are considering only either a PFR or CSTR which is an ideal flow dynamics in the reactor .	3.486465962053183

In many cases practical reactors may not be an ideal CSTR or ideal PFR .	3.4268221204523703

They might be some kind of deviation from the ideality because of the packing characteristics or some channeling taking place or in laboratory you can very easily maintain a good plug flow reactor .	2.9795165299780377

But in a large system it is always difficult to maintain and it is always desirable to identify or characterize your reactor with reference to flow behavior and then make a correction factor when the design part comes into .	3.074800044194412

So all these issues we will take individually rather than compounding all of them because not that all the issues will be applied in a particular reactor system we will have to identify the issues which are important .	3.280863443132825

For example we identify let us say the mass transfer limitations are the most acute .	4.281533523919434

The system is mass transfer limited .	5.203314889457478

There is point to consider reaction kinetics ; you design your reactor system based on mass transfer diffusional requirements .	2.685708461519701

Similarly if you consider that the flow behavior is drastically non - ideal there is a full channeling ; then corrections are to be applied to the design expression to get the reactor performance .	3.8068509206707946

Welcome to this course on Polymer Chemistry , I am Dibakar Dhara .	3.5044097296520857

I belong to the Department of Chemistry of IIT , Kharagpur .	2.988962500825799

In this course I planned to cover the following topics .	4.064131500731211

At the start I will be giving you a thorough introduction about the polymers which includes the classification , nomenclature and perspective of molecular of polymer molecules .	2.9113814028050697

Then I plan to cover in details various polymerization processes .	3.8941278196345834

I talk about , I will talk about the kinetics and the mechanism of different polymer processes which includes step growth and chain growth polymerization .	4.041670220485315

I also will cover copolymerization specially the kinetics of free radical copolymerization , and then I will also cover other important polymerization techniques such as ring opening polymerization , and coordination polymers .	2.702473850777082

And then I will cover polymer , important polymer properties and how the structure of polymer molecules correlates to these properties .	3.618352986167789

I will also cover both the chemical structure as well as physical structure of the polymers and how it relates to the polymer properties .	4.776874226716768

Now , after learning what are the topics , we planned to cover in this course , let us introduce polymer to you , what are polymers ?	3.3395330310262152

We we listen everywhere about the polymers , but what are polymers ?	3.554381406551129

In a very simple term , in a single sentence polymers can be defined that they are large molecules that is why sometimes they call macromolecules synonymously .	3.7584467565847706

They consist of many repeating structural units , the term polymers derived from Greek words poly and meros , poly means many and meros means part .	2.1250283706671977

If I want to just show you pictorially or schematically this is the representation of polymers , you have this structure units monomers and on polymerization its gives you a linkage between the polymers making a large molecules .	3.143060635027383

So , you get a polymer for example you have ethylene here and in this side after polymerization you have polyethylene .	4.178403154244514

Polymers can be made from more than one monomers as well , different monomers which is showed in pictorial in two colors and in that case you get a polymers consist of two different structural units , you and we call them as copolymers .	3.252962287908943

To just give you a example of copolymers I have a say I have a molecule like styrene and I also have a molecule like methyl methacrylate .	4.404208337373626

Now , this two can be polymerized to give you a poly styrene co MMA , this is a copolymer of poly styrene and methyl methacrylate .	4.1081683832997

Now , this term copolymers are used generally when you have a polymers which are synthesized from two different monomers where the monomers can be polymerized independently , which means in this case styrene as well as the MMA can be polymerized to , individually can aim to polystyrene and poly methyl methacrylate .	3.3844515352994433

There is other type of polymers which are also synthesized from two different monomers .	5.463548302269986

For example , if I take a example of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol , I have n molecules of this , n molecules of this which on polymerization gives you a polymers which is known as polyethylene terephthalate .	3.0447415148315535

We get this pet bottles they are this , they are made of this polyethylene terephthalate .	3.6304782334125445

So , in this case this polymer pet is also made from two different monomers terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and we make a polymer , but generally generally we do not call this polymer as a copolymer whenever , because as I said earlier this monomer terephthalic acid or this ethylene glycol cannot be polymerized independently by all or individually , this terephthalic acid cannot be made polymers by itself or a ethylene glycol cannot be made polymer by this process .	2.546712983232744

If if we have say more than one diol in this case ethylene glycol and say butylene glycol , that case we will have a mixture of two structure unit where you have terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and also a terephthalic acid and butylene glycol in this , that case we call this or we name this polymers as a copolymers .	3.573020793546599

To just repeat about this copolymers generally , we use the term copolymers where the polymer is synthesized form to different monomers where the monomers are or can be polymer individually .	2.9661630224317324

There is another case where polymer is made from two different monomers , but in this case we do not call this as a copolymers , because the constituents monomer usually cannot be homo polymerized independently by the same process .	3.0191739315618675

And when you make polymerization polymers , we invariably land up in distribution of molecular weight while a polymer is a high molecular weight , but it also gives you a distribution of molecular weight that means it has several length , the polymer mixture is consist of different molecular weight chains and this is , this high molecular weight of polymer which gives you or which enables a polymer to have this useful properties where , for which the polymer is known for for example , it gives you high tensile strength impact resistant , toughness , melt viscosity and and so on .	3.224492624615732

Now , you might ask me why and what is the reason this high molecular weight help in giving the , a polymer this superior properties compared to this small molecules .	3.12961557428834

Let us look at this cartoon , if you compare as collection of small molecules or short molecules like a sugar and a long molecules which is a polymer sample .	3.7238928742434805

This is individual colors ; individual chains represent a individual molecules in this case as well .	3.544366280157217

Now , this is a case where the individual molecules are small in size , they are not entangled with each other .	4.012507337914142

So , given a stress from outside they can be separated easily , in other word these small molecules behave independently .	3.243937090273218

If I just give you a example of real life , say I have taken a bowl of rice and you want to take out rice with a spoon , you can easily take out because each individual rice units behave independently .	2.956711687367257

So , you can easily take out rice from a bowl by a spoon .	3.0926516085575773

Whereas in case of polymers because of the large size and its flexibility they are present in a mixture in a entangled well .	3.967093984066123

That means the polymer chains are entangled to each other and as they are entangled they cannot be moved independently with each other for example , real life example if I have a bowl of noodles and I ask you to take a spoon , no , one spoon of noodles , you cannot independently take out as a noodles to the spoon because they are entangled .	2.6704744385359818

So , chains come together so when you take out a noodles you get a junk of polymer or no no pieces of noodles which you take out .	3.2940963320738144

So , in this case where it was very easy to deform or set up small , mixture of small molecules in this case because of the large molecules it is difficult to deform a polymer molecules which gives you high viscosity , which gives you the high strength of the polymer molecules , high impact resistant , toughness and all other good properties of molecular polymer samples and that is why polymers is so popular now a days .	3.0751262369209504

Okay , coming to the more definitions relevant to our course of polymer chemistry as such .	3.0190715137991297

Monomers are molecules from which polymers are made .	6.070086712984621

They must have at least or functionality of two to that means they can be , no , reacted at least from two sides for example , we talked about styrene molecules or ethylene molecules which means they can be extended from two sides .	3.177374436180224

So , for making a polymers you require monomers which have at least two functionality in them .	3.624806804524424

Repeating units it is a structure , a a polymer is formed from repeating units which means that when you write a polymer structures , the repeating unit is the unit which gets repeated .	3.866240182150492

For examples I talked about the ethylene molecule in or say simple example of say polystyrene molecule .	3.781333714542742

This is styrene and when it polymerized its gives you polystyrene .	3.6725620230429348

In this case this is the unit which is repeated which means and this is called , this is the repeat unit for polystyrene case .	4.803364939037714

Now , if I go back the example I gave in the few minutes back , in this case for example , for polyethylene terephthalate this is the unit which is represented in the bracket .	3.7415941262138404

It is subscript of n , this is the units which gets repeated .	4.50310077186478

So , if I want to write a structure of PET then I can take these units and put one after one to build the polymer units or the polymer molecules .	2.987130365089018

So , just to clarify one more time , in case of styrene we have the styrene unit as as a repeat unit and in case of PET you have this unit away with a repeating unit .	3.6484031223378333

We talk about oligomers .	8.013291386700752

Oligomers are you know during the process of polymer synthesis , you get the small chain units which are consist of 2 monomers , 3 monomers , 4 monomers and so on , dimer , trimer , tetramers and these are called or termed as oligomers .	3.095053301800772

Now , you can ask me till when , till what time we call a molecule as a polymer or oligomer ?	2.9196575000654064

Whether it is after 10 , 11 , 12 , 20 , 50 , 100 you know after how many repeat units , you call a polymer as a polymer and before that you call as a oligomer .	3.2740881746245933

Now , it depends it depends upon different polymers , the easiest way to think a molecule , a long molecule as a polymer not a oligomer if you add another unit repeating unit or you take out another unit and by doing this addition of one unit or taking out all unit , if the property of the polymer or the molecule does not change you call it as a polymer , but if change significantly then you still call it as a oligomer and that will depend on the chemical structure of the polymer .	2.7717831383814495

So , some cases if you increase from a repeat unit number from 20 to 21 or decrease from 20 to 19 you might see there is a change in the property , you cannot call that chain as a polymer you have to call that as a oligomer , whereas in some cases some some cases you do not see any changes say after 20 to make 20 to 21 and 20 to 19 then you call that as a polymer .	3.1543195998986038

Define degree of polymers , its , it is the number of structural units present in a polymer molecule .	5.601563905034835

What is structure units ?	8.511059665470828

Let us talk about the example I just showed you before .	5.062522416645491

So , in this case this unit is coming from a single monomer of styrene which where double bound is replaced by a single molecules .	2.826199600597294

So , in this case number of repeating units RU repeating units is same as number of structural units SU is structural units .	2.96786937712487

Whereas , in this case , case of polyethylene terephthalate individual monomers which are coming here and making the polymer they are called structural units .	3.7176964284997265

So , in this case if n is number of repeat units then it each unit consist of two structure units because in this repeat units is derived from two monomers , one terephthalic acid unit , one ethylene glycol units .	2.506992065489095

So , whereas in earlier case the number of repeating units were same as number of structural units .	3.7813779897470137

In this case number of repeat units is actually half of the number of structural units .	4.15662636161303

So , in this case if the molecular weight of of each styrene , molecular styrene is m and you have a polymer with n number of repeat units same as structural units then molecular weight of this polymer would be m multiplied by n .	3.2669704783287163

Now , what happened in this case ?	8.134371699781388

For example , if I take the molecular weight of this as m 1 and this as m 2 then how do you get the polymer molecular weight ?	3.7325756871613582

How do you define ?	9.851821243582313

How did you define the degree of polymerization is the number of structure unit .	5.531746337744599

So , in this case the polymer molecular weight will be degree of polymerization multiplied by the average of these two monomers minus the water molecules which have been eliminated , I will show you a example , real example in coming pages .	3.564430049513425

So , that it will get clear little bit more , if it is not clear already .	4.3105692064080525

So , let us see whether it get clarified to you in this cartoon .	3.55536788816987

You know in this case of styrene you have polystyrene in this case .	5.096080999484972

So , structural units is same as repeat units and in this case whether you have a say example of poly terephthalic acid PET terephthalate PET to it is the polymer is derived from two different units then the repeat units is this whereas , this consists of two structural units .	3.4727020203196255

So , if I take this this part then it this consist of four structural units , but only two repeat units and as I said degree of polymers is number of structural units , and the molecular weight of polymer molecules is degree of polymerization that means number of structural units multiplied by the average structure unit .	3.363145623491152

Now , before going forward let us clarify one thing in a more often or not you know in commonly polymers are referred as plastics .	2.592500618333396

People ask for banning plastics , plastic bag , plastic shoes , plastics bottle everything you know , most of the applications of polymers are referred to as a application of plastics .	2.8608616250184546

Now , there is certain difference between the term plastics and polymer .	3.7315582205838953

Polymers are the molecules which we synthesize from the monomer , they are individual molecules or a mixture of molecules , but we do not use when you synthesize a polymer from , in the lab or in a plant we do not use , in a seldom use as the polymers as synthesized .	3.2741985563795555

In most cases what happened we add some additives like pigment , stabilizers and then process that polymer mixture , you know polymer with the mixture to turn this polymer into a practical product .	2.2747776994824775

So , if I talk about pet bottle when you synthesize pet in the lab and that is not a plastic material or when you take a pet molecule poly terephthalate molecule in the plant and then mix with the stabilizer and other things and form that bottle , that is called plastics .	3.109633802708978

Plastics has also more , have more scientific definitions which we come later , but at at this point you must remember that plastics are made of polymers , but not all polymers are plastics like there are several other applications where polymers are not used as plastics .	2.709208984377547

So , that is this common term that is why this common term is appearing .	3.6687110053656977

Just one more time plastics are polymers , but not all polymers are plastics .	3.6853311446186177

Now , this knowing , what are polymers , what are plastics and what brings the good properties in polymers ?	2.9771163154424682

Now , why why you are , you will ask me why you are , why you need to study polymers , why we should be interested in studying polymer or polymer chemistry .	3.0296532859521887

If you think yourself or if you read magazines and talk to the older people then you will find that in last century whatever new material development has happened polymers will rank as one of the top .	2.6413601185479254

So , in last century polymer is one of the biggest success in terms of new material development and as a results more and more applications are existing or coming up where this polymers are replacing the conventional materials like metals , glass , wood and so on for example , I am wearing a spec .	2.767156744006496

Now , earlier , few years back for a decade back or so this spec was used to be made from glass , but now a days you will hardly find any spec is made up of glass , they are all made up of either polycarbonates or the cheaper ones are formed acrylics .	2.221772558119777

First thing comes into mind is a polymer and more often not a polymer becomes very often the material of choice for new applications .	3.0998930905277255

So , I have , hope you are convinced that polymers are you know a useful material and replacing the conventional materials .	2.815973856330279

If you are still not convinced , if you think what you do once you wake up from bed you take a brush which is made up of plastic material , you use the toothpaste which contain polymer molecules , you take food , foods are also having natural polymers , the container sometimes we use , disposable plastics and you wear shirts , clothes which are made of polyesters , cottons these are all examples of polymers .	2.3209184805805614

Then you come to office by a car or a bus or a cycle .	2.825573152626196

There are hundreds of polymer goes in those applications .	4.157809057729364

You name , you know wear shoes , everything .	4.2196153716139

Now , you can argue me that these are very common common materials and these are no need for main development work for this .	3.016932039722195

So , you do not need to study polymer because the knowledge or technical knowledge for this common applications are well established , but if you think about examples of polymer like a artificial valve which is made of polyethylene .	2.527239825979661

Talk about a oxygenator which is used during a heart , open heart surgery or talk about applications in car head lamp , aircraft windows and and several high end applications like very high capacity DVDs .	2.1343305577748795

Now , these are also application of polymers which it does not come to your mind immediately , but like this there are hundreds of very high end applications of polymers .	2.9808726698794845

For examples polymers are used in medicine , as a drug delivery vehicle , as a conservation with drugs , molecules and so many .	2.8592206994232177

So , in this case you require a definitive knowledge about polymers which will enable you to develop or innovate new polymer molecules or new polymer applications .	2.683101402709543

Now , why why people use polymer compared to this conventional materials or traditional materials ?	3.198666133531918

There are definitive , there are some definitive advantages for example , I just gave you example of the spec .	3.4448482744670814

Now , because of the lighter of weights polymers used heavily in transportations like car automotive , in trains and all these things because the light you travel that will consume less fuel .	2.2259516213731896

This is one of the most important advantages of using polymers which gives you excellent strength to weight ratio .	3.662050658530802

It gives you design flexibility , you know there are and also various you know the option of giving you modern styling you know .	2.6579625326337473

You buy a cheap processing you can make , take the polymers which is comes in after from the lab or in a plant and you can do the polymer processing , do a process and make or give that polymer a very nice shapes of your choice and give good style which is not possible with the traditional materials like glass and metals .	2.7358368881619164

Polymers are most cases thermal insulator which makes it or enables polymers to use in electronic industry and unlike the conventional materials like wood , metal they are optically clear which enables application of polymers in media , and optical devices and one more important that there are so many polymers available in market that you can choose a definite polymer for your particular applications .	2.2938724001740605

So , that you have , you do not have to limit it with number of polymers available , there are so many polymers available now in market .	3.388105730961314

So , it gives you the option of choosing a definite polymer or particular polymers for your choice of applications and of course , you know not more often and not it comes with a lower cost .	2.7296171341641804

Some polymers are of course , very costly , that gives you very good performance , but more often not the polymers gives you , comes with a lower cost .	2.5701053304803088

Now , before I come to the introduction of polymers or polymer chemistry , I just want to give you a big picture , a view on the top , a bird ’ s eye view from how you look at polymers .	2.847101461699011

You know different stages , life stages of polymers and how it get transformed where they induce of polymers .	2.859327881397328

So , you have a polymer molecule which you synthesized in the lab .	4.743474837763853

Now , when you synthesized you get it in solution or in a bulk .	4.118069792386628

So , you have a polymer which is prepared in the plant which is coming either in solution or in a bulk .	3.6867591356274536

Sometimes , it come other form as well like in emulsions .	3.712333597211693

So , if it is solution you have to take out the polymers from the solution in a powder form and if it is in a bulk or in a melt form you can use as such and if it is in emulsion cases like some cases it is in emulsion .	4.262285616070569

So , you can use the emulsion as such .	5.231248801310318

Now , where how do you get these polymers ?	6.3940157171769965

There are some polymers or few polymers which comes from natural sources like polysaccharide cellulose and more often not these natural polymers , the polymers which comes from natural source are very useful .	2.6597951886064677

So , in most cases to find a polymer , these polymers are synthesized in a plant from raw materials which are monomers by the process , which are termed as polymerization .	3.234592316470849

So , you have polymers which you can get from natural source , but in majority of places a polymer is synthesized from raw materials , monomer by process called polymerization .	3.2339767625900584

How , where from do you get this monomers or the raw material ?	4.704143723104684

Most cases you get from petroleum resources , ultimately from a crude oil or in some cases you also get a monomers from renewable resources or bio resources .	2.628066173879605

As I said most cases synthetic polymers are prepared or synthesized from monomers which are derived from petroleum resources .	2.896082094205934

So , now we have know where from a polymer is made .	4.733475622489652

Now , you have to take the polymers towards application side .	4.963907416657745

There are minority of polymers are taken to the applications where polymers are used along with the other ingredients like in detergents .	4.36135957906717

In a detergent formulation you have surfactant polymers and other ingredients .	3.0691528817308145

If you talk about say eye drop you have polymer in aqueous solutions with salt and other ingredients .	2.847456078410791

So , in this case this are the applications which are which are where the minor , there is a minor fraction of polymers going , where polymers are used in a mixture in a solution or some other form whether polymers is either a you know active ingredient or is just act as a support role like enhancing the viscosity enhancer and so on .	2.639500136578781

You can have the other ingredients along with the polymer like a stabilizer fillers or pigments , but it is the polymers which is the major ingredient and other additives acts as a support which either enable the polymer to have you know better performance .	3.732569584949788

So , in that case what is done the polymers as comes out from plant is taken to a step , taken through a step , a polymer processing step which are commonly called compound where the polymer either in a melt form or in powder form is mixed with the required additives or property enhanced enhancing fillers or sometimes with other polymers as well to make polymer blends and you get a intermediate product , is like pellets .	2.4685654933417323

We call this as resins ; you might have seen this granules or pellets yourself in sometimes in the market and if the final applications is does not require very complicated geometry then in this process itself you can make the final product for example , like sheets film where in this processing step itself , the polymers are taken and the additives or fillers are added and it is given a shape of the final products like sheets and film etcetera , but this is not the major application this is the minor applications .	3.1474053581070924

In most cases the polymer manufacturer makes this as a intermediate products and they sell this to its customer who makes the final product .	2.8188244446978445

And once the polymer and this pellets are supplied to the equipment manufacturer , they do a processing steps to give you or to give the final shape , design fabrication step or in a finishing shape and you get the final products which gives you the , which goes into the final applications .	3.1767153477646684

I will give examples which will clarify these points more in , once the final application is done the , this life cycle of the polymers does not end .	3.0315105465968504

Once the application of over polymers become a waste and its very important is as important as the earlier steps that we have a very good waste management system by which we can either , we use or recycle the polymers and if you cannot recycle or reuse the polymers then this waste of the polymer , the polymer waste has to be handled very carefully .	3.0631376968201556

So , that it does not pollute the environment .	5.31775729511741

So , if I repeat this life stages and various transformation step you have a monomer which most often we get from petroleum products and from monomers by doing a step called polymerization we get the polymers in the plant or in a lab either in solution or in bulk or in some cases in emulsion form .	3.0283261331318063

If it is a solution you have to take out the polymers as a powder form .	5.735276048176201

So , you have now the polymers .	5.663742128866199

In minority of application this polymers are taken and added to other ingredients like the examples I gave in detergents , but in major cases the polymer is mixed with the other ingredients like additives , pigments , stabilizers and it is by a process called polymer processing , compounding and you , it is transformed with granules or flakes or pellets to form intermediate product .	2.408917222518024

These intermediate products are taken by the equipment manufacturer and by doing another processing step for example , injection molding they give the proper shape of the final applications where this polymer goes in .	2.6228890204679987

How this , how the polymer industry works ?	4.691679526865555

They get the monomers from other source or they might make themselves as well and they , after making the polymers in the plant they also do this steps themselves , from this intermediate product .	2.750591655415407

And then sell it to some original equipment manufacturer which do this processing step , molding step to make the final product , which goes into the final applications .	2.6753128579368584

Now , let us come to a specific example .	5.497514235865761

For example if I take a car head lamp cover , the cover of the car head lamp is nowadays made from polycarbonate material .	2.3907305669810017

Polycarbonate is synthesized from two monomers this phenol A and phosgene to give you polycarbonate .	4.000377095088116

Now , how do you get , how this this is produced ?	5.096322249232158

This BPA molecule , this is produced from phenol and acetone and this is produced from coke getting oxidized to carbon monoxide which one react to it chlorine gives you phosgene .	2.5522586219771797

Where from this phenol comes from ?	5.414361819259764

It comes from cumin plus acetone .	4.950722937440492

Where from this cumin comes from ?	5.174374845157904

This comes from petroleum products , which is eventually coming from crude oil .	3.283316289692808

You take this polycarbonate as synthesized in a plant or in lab , add these additives , pigments etcetera and we are compounding strips and you get PC pellets .	2.774456436466985

You you sell this PC plates to a cumin manufacturer which will make say injection molding and make the head lamp cover at OEM which will be sold to the car manufacture .	2.385643248625987

Let us just go back to earlier page and repeat this .	4.243690298250049

Now , a company which makes polycarbonate , which sells polycarbonate like say Bayer or SABIC .	2.539766126652765

They can source the monomer at any stage , they can buy BPA and phosgene , they can buy phenol and make BPA them self or they can buy a cumin and they make and they can phenol from which they can make BPA and and then PC .	2.3659849993940534

They also do this step , this step compounding step them self .	3.453763182988934

Now , after making these pellet they sell it to original equipment manufacturer .	3.358300713547246

This original equipment manufacturer buy this pellets , polycarbonate pellets from any of these big companies and they mold it to , they mold it to give a form of a head lamp cover which they then supply and sell it to a car manufacturer who assemble these head lamp along with other things and have this product in the market .	2.293634218582967

So , this gives you idea about a different stages of polymers and how the industry work .	3.8910496845388565

There are some smaller industries which make custom polymer products .	3.0542063980062673

Now , what is the present focus of in a polymer research ?	4.834558244514869

If I go back to the earlier slide as I said that most of the current synthetic polymers are made up from monomers which are ultimately sourced from petroleum products as there is a increasing interested interest to make polymer from the monomers which are not source from petroleum products , because on using the polymers or making polymers from petroleum , there is a fear of you know depletion of petroleum resources .	3.127309394473691

So , current focus in polymer research is to make monomer and subsequent polymers from a natural sources , which could be a bio source or a source which can be renewed or the source by by renewal resources .	2.6427224280286787

There is a focus also make this polymerization process green and environmental friendly where you avoid use of this toxic chemicals and gases like solvents and other things .	2.21651236817526

There is also emphasis of making new polymers of complicated structures which will find applications in newer especially in medicines and also this this is a continued research interest where you take existing polymers and add additive fillers , new additive fillers or different processing step , now improve processing include polymer processing where you you make this different improved application of or newer applications of the existing polymer .	2.100393432530338

And of course , there is a very highly important you know the more importance given specially from the government side about the waste management of polymers specially recycling of polymers and find the ways where you can we use the polymers and of course , the there is a need for research how to properly manage the polymer waste .	2.982908668247972

With this I we will stop this class .	5.405471717809604

In the coming class I will start with classifications of polymer .	4.108703885505823

Just to repeat what what I covered in this class , we talked about the definition of what are polymers ?	3.794459381494053

Polymers are large molecules , which is made from repetition of structural units .	4.709966029555411

We also learned why we should study polymers , polymers as you by now convinced that find applications in conventional applications as well as very newer applications , very high end applications and we also learned why nowadays polymer is used more and more applications , what are the good properties of polymers and why polymers are different , you know why polymers are get what what are the structural features of polymer gives you this is improved properties and then we also learned big picture .	2.766992917815498

Now , what are the different stages of polymers and then how the polymers are transformed from one stage to another and ultimately where how the polymer industry works and then we talked about finally about what are the important research areas in currently researcher focusing in polymer chemistry .	2.658432831229816

We will start in next class , continue the introduction and we start from the classification of polymers .	2.960130830140989

So far we have been talking about the kinetics of single substrate enzyme catalyzedreactions and as we all know that in the living cells a large variety of enzymes interact with the multiple substrates .	3.745335049397221

In fact most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction that do take place in a living cell involves two substrates in most cases .	3.7170645039522947

We have also seen that under certain set of conditions the classical Michaelis Menten kinetics which has been proposed for single substrate enzymatic reactions can also be applied to bi - substrate reactions .	3.160830757003431

Certain conditions apply but those conditions are by and large extreme conditions .	3.451363476435735

That is you have to have one of the substrate in a very large excess concentration .	6.657189186348748

Those situations may not really exist in a living cell .	3.7066905494498483

In a living cell the concentration of the two substrates that are to interact with the enzyme may be almost in an equal or near by concentration levels .	3.902630017379561

They may not be extremely different and therefore it is necessary to look at the actual effect of the bi - substrate reactions on the reaction rate .	4.222195832643349

Two of the examples which I have chosen here are one on alcohol dehydrogenase which oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde involving a co - enzyme NAD and the other is hexokinase catalyzed phosphorylation of glucose or any other hexose to the corresponding phosphorylated sugar .	2.476341068781324

Bulk of the bi - substrate reactions do fall in the category of either oxidoreductases or transferases or lipases .	2.850206801191807

Most of the hydrolytic enzymes isomerizes or often can be analyzed using classical Michaelis Menten kinetics .	2.844624173068606

The oxidoreductases represented by the first reaction or a transferase represented by hexokinase or in many cases the lipases are the real true bi - substrate reactions which in general should not be treated or analyzed with the Michaelis Menten kinetics .	2.607874462653882

To account for the rate of reaction for such reactions taking example of a typical bi - substrate reaction as I have shown here in general I have left certain dots in between , in between the substrate as well as the product stream .	3.3491975706733377

Basically that signifies that the dynamics of the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate molecule may be quite varied unlike in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics where you have a single substrate and it has to bind on the active site of the enzyme molecule and form an enzyme substrate complex .	4.2324381744090696

Here because the substrates are more than one there are many possibilities for interaction between the substrate and the enzyme molecules and so therefore these dotted figures indicate a variety of interactions that are involved .	3.8796286845795005

But in general the action of enzymes on a reaction involving two substrates A and B giving rise to products X and Y is expressed here .	3.0340101690051333

A generalized rate expression for this was proposed by Alberty based on steady state hypothesis .	4.251567400041166

Again similar considerations as we talked about in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics .	4.7015994610890495

He proposed the initial reaction rate for such a reaction can be given by an expression given here .	5.026692446021715

Let us say this is expression one .	4.953359204929864

That is V0 = Vm.A.B Vm is the maximum reaction velocity where both the substrates A and B are in saturating concentrations .	3.395630979941254

That means both the substrates are in large quantity and they are able to saturate the enzyme which in concentration terms is much , much smaller than the A or B .	3.4898217031555525

The concentration of enzyme is much , much smaller than either A or B .	4.286971515427819

Almost the same assumptions that we made in case of Michaelis Menten kinetics and the A and B can be to a saturating level providing a maximum reaction velocity .	3.3996066923217145

The denominator term gives you another three kinetic parameters ; K ’ A is the dissociation constant of binding of E to A giving EA .	3.0017615997329896

That means when we talk of KB , KB is that concentration of B at which the reaction velocity V is half of that of Vm at a saturating concentration of A .	3.1255934187708028

Similarly for K that concentration of A at which the reaction velocity is half that of Vm at a saturating concentration of B .	3.4689932724861396

Or in other words we are analogous to our classical Michaelis Menten constant for the substrate .	3.851872927021839

That means you can consider that KB is the Michaelis Menten constant with respect to B at saturating concentration of A .	3.413262982231868

There might be some confusion about KA and K ’ A .	3.667799384264154

K ’ A is the dissociation constant for binding of A to the enzyme .	4.891843435744374

KA is the corresponding Michaelis Menten constant with respect to A .	5.248783325723003

In most cases this dissociation constant is different than the apparent Michaelis Menten constant unlike in the case of single substrate reaction where the two are almost identical .	3.9388275889952826

You will notice that the apparent Michaelis Menten constant will depend upon the concentration of the other substrate also and this dissociation does not depend upon the other substrate .	4.29237134363877

Out of the several mechanisms , in one of the mechanisms this K ’ A may be equal to K and the rate expression will accordingly get modified .	3.663515981425656

Under those conditions if you take the first expression you will notice that this can also be considered almost like as you mentioned earlier while looking at the validity of Michaelis Menten kinetics for bi - substrate reactions that if we put one of the substrate concentration in excess the expression can represent the bi - substrate reaction kinetically with respect to other substrate .	3.534351481980743

So therefore if let us say B is very large , B tends to infinity then V0 = Vm.A / KA + A Both from numerator and denominator divide by V some of the terms will be cancelled and you will end up with a simple expression like Michaelis Menten .	2.6533344522846116

Similarly when A tends to infinity analogous expression will emerge V0 = Vm.B / KB + B So you get a similar expression in the case of excess concentration of or large concentration of one of the reactants and that was also the understanding we had when we discussed Michaelis Menten kinetics .	2.9412405267338086

You can rearrange this general expression by taking certain factors and divide both and you can end up at the constant concentration of B .	3.131015871564221

If you consider B as a constant at some value of B the expression will turn out to be analogous to Michaelis Menten constant .	3.1797393203651136

If this becomes a constant parameter , at constant B you can write Vm.A.B / ( KB + B ) V0 = ( K ’ A.KB + KA.B ) / ( KB + B ) + A We have rearranged the general equation in the form of Michaelis Menten expression .	2.809872699114774

So therefore at any constant value of B you can consider that the apparent value of Km for A KA is K ’ A.KB + KA.B KAapp = KB + B This is the apparent Km with respect to A by rearranging this general equation .	3.0030043033448743

You notice the relationship between the apparent Km for A and K ’ A .	4.049577355384597

Although they are related it also involves the concentration term of the other substrate which is B and a similar relationship like this when you consider constant concentration of A and the apparent Km for B .	3.191975954218637

Or in other words in a special case when K ’ A = KA ; Kmapp = KA The relationship between these two terms implies that when they are same as the Michaelis Menten constant with respect to A it does not interfere and K ’ A = KA .	3.4376328131204836

It has no effect on the binding of B and so it is independent of concentration of B in the reaction mixture .	5.657821082938969

Similar situation will apply if you consider K ’ A.KB + KB.A Kmapp for B = KA + A Again here also similarly you will notice K ’ A = KA ; Kmapp for B KB This here also K ’ A = KA .	2.551391734686172

It is with respect to first substrate binding .	5.659701120634173

Under this condition I am trying to give you an analogy or an explanation as to how KA and K ’ A are related .	3.0093626673479927

If you consider the single substrate reaction the dissociation constant of substrate with the enzyme is analogous to Km value , whereas in the case of bi - substrate reaction that situation is not true .	4.194603778792518

That is only a special case of a bi - substrate reaction under which the Km apparent for B will become equal to KB when these two become equal .	3.1509430270442906

Otherwise this value will be this magnitude although they will have a relationship but they will be a function of other substrate concentration .	4.752573230010308

The other substrate concentration will influence the magnitude of Kappm in the case of a bi - substrate reaction whereas in the case of a single substrate reaction the Km value was almost analogous under the assumption that the term turn over number that is K2 term is not very , very small .	3.5105739370544105

Otherwise if it is very small they have a difference but if it is not very small the two are analogous .	6.048127776610401

In the first case this should be KA .	5.751318559901425

You can also look at these expressions in a graphical mode and to have a better visualization .	3.9502238643997214

In the first case when we are talking of constant B your profile will be something like this .	3.58646271806512

This is your maximum reaction velocity and your half Vm will be this one where KA apparent with respect to substrate A will be K ’ A.KB + KA.B KAapp = KB + B Similarly here this situation will become V0 when the value of B is saturating .	2.6122007239577862

It will be Vm when the value of B is saturating .	4.611198751871684

At any other V value of B the rate profile will be a hyperbolic profile analogous to that of Michaelis Menten constant .	3.733816003555786

Similarly in the case of A constant you will have another Km value K ’ A.KB + KB.A Kmapp = KA + A Here also this is your constant A .	2.9303893939004046

This will be a maximum reaction velocity when A becomes saturating .	5.511155871625017

Such a situation can be conceived as a simplification of Michaelis Menten system .	3.5153926258925825

Another way to look at this kinetic expression is , just like we have been looking under all the cases of single substrate reaction , double reciprocal plots which will also give us the magnitude of all the kinetic parameters that are involved .	3.9749053047490985

What will be the kind of the double reciprocal plot ?	6.679975705996699

In the case of a generalized rate expression one can just write 1 / V0 = ( 1 + KA / A + KB / B + K ’ A.KB / AB ) / Vm That is the double reciprocal plot if we divide both the numerator and denominator by A into B you will get rate expression .	2.82567160937197

If you plot this at a constant value of V just like in the first case when we take constant value of V , you will get a profile with B increasing at different constant value of V .	3.1830275051888437

If B increases you will get a slope of KA + K ’ A.KB / B Vm The intercept on this factor will be 1 + KB / B Vm So you will notice that both slope as well as intercept of the profiles will decrease as you increase the value of B and ultimately when this B become saturating it will be a typical K value for the substrate A .	3.2645650317377632

Experimentally the magnitude of KA , KB , K ’ A and Vm can be determined by double reciprocal plot analysis .	3.730689163681618

If you recall what we did in the case of the inhibition patterns , we took the double reciprocal plots and then took slopes and intercept and made secondary plot .	2.875211476475703

Similarly here if you plot 1 / B versus the magnitude of slope you will get again a straight line with the slope equal to K ’ A.KB / Vm and intercept of KA / Vm .	3.8014026968493226

In the case of intercept the slope will be KB / Vm and intercept of 1 / Vm .	3.8786697390467015

Therefore by a double reciprocal plot at different concentrations of B and plotting the 1 / B versus the slope and intercept one can determine the values of the four kinetic parameters that are involved in a bi - substrate reaction that is KA , KB , K ’ A and Vm .	2.9943879117856578

These are the four kinetic parameters unlike in the case of a single substrate reaction where we are concerned only with two kinetic parameters Km and Vm .	3.5263711273968594

One can determine experimentally , the various kinetic parameters in the case of a bi - substrate reaction .	3.858026839149259

You will notice that while looking at the generalized expression of the bi - substrate reaction rate expression we have not really bothered about the dynamics of enzyme substrate interaction .	3.6314558551510507

We have just kept it in a black box some interaction takes place by which the products are formed and some general rate expression have been arrived at which involves certain kinetic parameters which have been considered in analogy to single substrate reaction because the kinetic analysis of enzyme catalyzed reactions have been so much dominated by Michaelis Menten kinetics that any new mechanism or any proposed mechanism must be interpreted in the light of those Km and Vm as parameters and that is what we have done .	2.663149191993136

We must also look at the possible kind of interactions that are likely to take place and almost all the interactions between enzyme and substrate for bi - substrate reactions have been classified into some general forms .	3.0904718615477234

The first form , the first complex formation can be considered as the random ternary complex formation .	3.6964453744152244

When we are talking of enzyme and two substrates there is a quite logical choice that we might end up instead of binary complex , a ternary complex where E , A and B all the three are combined together before a product formation takes place .	2.782628313371688

In the case of random ternary complex formation the enzyme can form binary complex EA and EB to start with and also the ternary complex EAB with no restriction on the order in which A and B bind to the enzyme .	3.0922448496837065

It can start by binding first with the A and then B will hook on to that or it can start with EB and then A will hook on to that or in other words that you will notice just like in the case of the non competitive inhibition the A and B both have separate binding sites on the enzyme molecule and therefore they don ’ t interfere with each other and randomly they can bind and once the ternary complex formation has taken place the product formation will begin .	2.9199009930699114

You can express it in a mechanistic way the enzyme going to EA or EB and EAB and this four this will go in cyclic form .	2.693252371402026

EAB then goes to form your E plus X plus Y .	3.4504646804047807

E k1 k4 k - 1k - 4 EA EB k - 2 k - 3 k2 EAB E + X + Y There will be rate constant at this state k1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 , k - 3 , k4 and k - 4 .	3.248544673996692

Either reaction can go in this direction or in this direction there is no constraint on the order of the ternary complex formation .	4.160399618001867

Typical example is yeast alcohol dehydrogenase which follows such a kind of mechanism .	3.9105305346280983

Another typical feature is that the kinetic parameters of the same enzyme which catalyses the same reaction from two different sources are different .	4.316751542638935

For example yeast alcohol dehydrogenase follows a random ternary complex formation as a part of the dynamics of their enzyme substrate interaction whereas the same enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase from the mammalian cells doesn ’ t follow this kind of mechanism ; it follows an ordered mechanism where it can bind only to one of the substrate first before the second substrate can bind and that ’ s why the kinetic parameter will automatically turn out to be different .	2.712093156926542

One of the reasons in such cases is based on the different reaction mechanisms that are involved .	4.381026856280028

Similarly yeast hexokinase also follows this kind of mechanism where the ternary complex formation is obtained .	3.502281771289102

They may be equal to in some cases or they may not be equal to because ultimately the multiplication of the two dissociation constant in reaching to EAB will be same .	3.812133324898929

In specific cases they may be equal also .	5.746391359804417

But we have just put the different rate constants .	5.249424642496963

The second case again with respect to ternary complex formation is ordered ternary complex formation .	3.757257351311026

Here the ternary complex EAB can be formed from only one of the complex EA .	5.048866358128382

I have taken hypothetically EA it could be EB also and only one of the binary complex has to trigger the enzyme substrate interaction and then the other substrate will interact with the EA complex .	3.895724106300477

The reaction cannot proceed in this direction that is B cannot bind to the free E and the reaction has to proceed in an anticlockwise fashion that means after E has bound to A , B will bind to EA , EAB will be formed and ultimately this will form EY releasing one of the products let us say X and then this will release another product Y and they will be let us say k3 , k4 .	2.8942822470440555

But the product formation will take place only after the ternary complex formation has begun .	4.037719927827547

The process in this direction is not feasible .	5.770066730162098

A typical example of the ordered ternary complex formation as I mentioned is liver alcohol dehydrogenase which is obtained in the mammalian systems and also lactate dehydrogenase is another example of ordered ternary complex formation .	2.8245497348939894

You can see that the same alcohol dehydrogenase can follow different mechanisms .	3.7395964441224527

A special case of ordered ternary complex formation is Thorell and Chance mechanism because in many of the enzyme catalyzed reactions , Thorell and Chance observed that ternary complex is not a very stable entity and it exists only for a short period of time .	2.960763216607396

A special case of ordered ternary complex formation when B reacts with EA ; the order is important .	2.876488150843492

We can only react with enzyme only when A has bound to it to form and one of the products is released and the modified enzyme substrate complex is generated .	3.230171625218175

That means a modified enzyme substrate complex is generated and a first product has been released without the formation of a stable ternary complex of kinetic significance .	2.766533603832597

That means the half life of the ternary complex is very , very small in this scheme .	3.585482853565444

Although they never said that the ternary complex formation doesn ’ t take place , they agreed that ternary complex formation is taking place but the half life of the ternary complex is very small and before that the second substrate can interact with the EA to form the first product .	3.234310671346892

Or in other words you can have E again going to EA and then this EA can then convert into EY releasing a product X and then this EY can give you back E releasing another product Y and you can have k1 , k - 1 , k2 and k3 .	2.877435294308556

Such a kind of a system where although the second substrate B reacts with EA to give you the first product and the ternary complex is not a very stable entity is classified into the Thorell and Chance mechanism .	3.3257753858558643

A typical example of such a reaction is glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase which you also come across in the case of glycolysis .	4.0294585084849075

But it is only a special case of an ordered mechanism where ordered ternary complex formation is not denied .	3.822273176596191

One can also consider either as a special case of ternary complex formation or a special case of binary complex formation .	3.7463119942164416

But binary complex cannot lead to a product .	5.652035854363711

The second substrate has to interact with the binary complex before the first product can arrive at but the stable intermediates are only EA and EY .	2.8603806034294075

The fourth mechanism which represents the binary complex formation is Ping - Pong mechanism .	4.085111710337233

You will also notice that in many books it is written as Ping - Pong bi - bi mechanism .	3.195804749934216

The term bi - bi refers to substrate and product .	4.0397297676663095

Bi - bi means two substrates and two products .	4.1641199417657635

In case of many of the ligases the situation may be bi - uni .	3.460003465562271

That means the product may be one the substrates may be two .	3.4643050092832492

All those cases are clubbed under Ping - Pong mechanism and in this case of Ping - Pong mechanism the basic hypothesis is that no ternary complex is formed .	2.881199966118591

As soon as the first substrate binds to the enzyme it can react to form the B to form a product or it can split off to a product E .	3.9962680568734603

You will notice that the two things like Thorell and Chance mechanism and the Ping - Pong mechanism in some way might show analogy .	3.0048906334773346

That means as soon as the EA of the first binary complex is formed the interaction with the second substrate forms a product , first product or it splits off to a product and a modified enzyme substrate complex which then reacts with B to form Y .	2.896253423568456

Therefore E reacts with A to form EA with k1 and k - 1 .	3.0566044087231607

Right at this stage itself the product will be formed which is X and this will be EA ’ and this is k2 .	4.367703783602512

EA ’ then interacts with B to give you EA ’ B and then this gives you a product again which is Y with k3 and k4 .	3.575576617241361

As soon as the first binary subjects complex is formed one of the product is released .	4.941778372211703

Then the next substrate interacts and the next product is released .	3.5276788036150606

So that is what happens in such cases and a large number of transferases , most of the bulk of tranferases fall in the category of ping pong reaction mechanism excepting those of the yeast source and most of the mammalian hexokinases form under the category of ping pong .	2.8639835737183663

They lead to the classification of ping pong mechanism .	5.450108923280719

When we look into these mechanisms and develop steady state rate expressions specifically you will end up in quite complex situations .	2.9768024238365927

EA ’ is hypothetical in the sense it may not be a binary complex .	5.271158962856103

It will be more clear it is E ’ , the enzyme in the modified form .	4.362252927578322

The first substrate has reacted and released the product .	3.708786145124593

Enzyme is modified and second substrate attacks and then releases another product .	3.04575965968117

That would be a better interpretation .	5.964931329002275

Whereas in the case of Thorell and Chance mechanism this will be a binary complex , this will not be a modified enzyme .	4.228597014527801

When we look at these reaction mechanisms with the increased order of complexity between the dynamics of enzyme substrate interaction , the rate expression will also be quite complex if you put them in terms of individual rate constants .	3.4858648780400996

Each of the reaction mechanism involves particularly the random ternary complex formation will involve nine rate constants four reversible and one irreversible step , nine rate constant and the expression will be quite complex .	3.045047507281351

In practice to derive expression may be quite complex and we are talking only a binary substrate complex formation that might be enzymatic reaction which may involve three substrates and system will be still more complex .	2.9585518805671485

Before I go to give you the rate expression for these different mechanisms I like to introduce you to a simplified methodology for writing a rate expression under a steady state hypothesis .	3.477835371947083

Of course the steady state hypothesis is valid .	5.030680682719054

They analyzed number of reaction mechanisms and using matrix algebra they wrote down rate expression for different kinetic mechanisms and all steady state expressions can be solved out .	2.44014613014287

Ultimately making some generalizations from those matrix algebra , Wong and Hans in 1962 proposed certain set of simplified rules almost like empirical rules .	2.217171181705736

Although they are based on hard core mathematics matrix algebra he generalized certain rules so that by observation of the reaction mechanism as long as you can write a reaction mechanism one can arrive at a rate expression in a simplistic way .	3.5360684796332422

I will try to introduce you with that kind of a system taking a simple example so that , that can be applied to our complex binding substrate system to arrive at the actual rate expressions .	3.114684053751315

The kind of system we will take for simplicity will be a two enzyme substrate complex formation ES going to ET going to E plus P .	3.3121561818272482

k1 k2 k3 E + S ES ET E + P k - 1 k - 2 k - 3 We can take a reversible system k1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 , k - 3 .	4.3289118071542445

To illustrate the procedure followed I chose this reaction mechanism .	3.238704542515343

The very first step in such a procedure as proposed by Wong and Hans is that we need to write any reaction mechanism in a cyclic form .	3.506450746022076

Cyclic form means you will have inter conversions of the enzyme substrate complexes .	5.525526780069241

For example here as you notice enzyme species can exist in the form of E , ES and ET in three forms .	3.224611007120683

So the whole reaction mechanism can be interpreted in the form of a triangle with three vertices , each vertex representing one of the enzyme species .	3.4120150999614847

Therefore you can write such a reaction mechanism as E , ES and ET .	5.336644798101143

Now show the inter convention of each of the enzyme species say for example E ES , ES ET and ET E .	3.6150734531539768

ES E ET Let us say this is your Sk1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 and pk - 3 .	4.50789832147353

We write the rate constant for all these steps in the cyclic form making them in the kind of a first order rate constant .	4.389550204926375

For example wherever there is substrate involved in binding over enzyme the rate constant can be written as Sk1 .	3.489167964256042

Where there is no substrate involved only simple rate constant can be written and similarly wherever ET is going to form the product in the reverse direction , the product concentration will be incorporated The inter conversions of the enzyme forms involved in each step must be described by a term called Kappa .	2.941231677691953

The conversion of the rate constant or interpreting each of these steps in terms of first order rate constant term is called Kappa .	4.463380594922254

Then we consider each enzyme species in sequence .	4.3609821705391445

For example we take E and consider all the possible pathways by which E is formed in this cyclic manner .	2.9082306304544954

E can be formed by all the possible pathway involving n - 1 steps .	4.2614774652915095

That means if there are three enzyme species number of species are n and n - 1 steps will be involved in each pathway .	3.095904190885946

We identify that E can be formed by this and this .	4.673450580644842

Similarly you can form this and this .	7.168761229394236

Write all the possible pathways which are feasible to form and this is for E .	4.55176462493508

What I am trying to explain is that for each of the enzyme species write down all the path ways involving n - 1 steps .	3.1167479171129417

One of the considerations in such a system is that all the path ways that converges at a particular enzyme species are permissible .	3.8437956268185545

But the path way which leaves the enzyme species in both directions is not permissible .	3.4706394702408296

That is a system like this will not be permissible if it happens .	3.7560037879036257

Are you clear ?	12.999316384750239

For each of the enzyme species we work out the path way by which these species may be synthesized .	3.5911621556201134

Each path way must consist of n - 1 steps where n is the number of enzyme species present and the product of the kappas of the steps in each pathway is determined .	3.2509916855105407

You can write the kappas here and you can have the kappa product .	5.301962336699114

For example what is the kappa product for this pathway ?	5.261930613810791

pk - 1 , k - 3 .	27.02284371855562

So the product of this Kappa is this .	5.3553511840145065

In this case it is k - 2 and k - 1of this one and the third path way will be pk2 k - 3 .	3.8054631595221533

We are talking of E .	8.674447572631134

In this expression we are writing for the formation of the enzyme species E .	6.9935730953982596

sk1 form ES .	12.821885893306234

k - 2 forms E by ES .	6.231620319755757

What we mentioned is that we are considering only pathways which have two steps n - 1 steps and any steps which lead to formation of E involving two steps will be considered .	3.046076317411241

First pathway involves two steps this one and this one .	4.546248126593101

They are only the steps which are involved in formation of E .	4.777763708279344

They are just generalized rules .	6.045848901787301

Otherwise you have to go to the matrix algebra to solve the simultaneous equations and you will arrive at the same thing .	4.619463892789704

Wong and Hans simplified the whole matrix algebra did by King and Altmen and formed certain rules .	2.4996196397270807

He said that you form a cyclic reaction mechanism and write down the pathway for each of the enzyme species or for example we can take any simpler case let us take probably the simplest case E plus P .	3.2283429780681656

E + S ES E + P k1 , k - 1 and k2 .	4.377635999873908

For such simple system writing by observation will look to be more difficult than solving the steady state equation but if you have let us say more than one enzyme substrate complex it may look to be simpler to write by observation .	3.2496921912583754

‘ n ’ represents the number of enzyme species involved in the mechanism , whereas in the case of what I showed we have three enzyme species E , ES and ET .	3.712657918218541

This is how you define a pathway .	5.437753012706852

It ’ s not a pathway in the sense of metabolic pathway .	3.813043932289027

It ’ s the number of steps involved in formation of that each having n - 1 step .	3.787711355314347

So I think we will stop at this point .	3.6363878738171245

Welcome to this 12th lecture of course in Polymer Chemistry .	3.8147925238756573

And in this lecture I plan to continue the discussion on chain transfer reaction and their implications .	4.757581891263446

And then we talk about the inhibition and retardation reactions , we talk about how to determine or what is the procedure of determination of different reaction rates , rate of initiation , rate of termination rate of polymerization .	3.8408805164491686

And we talk about and discuss now how to determine the rate constant different rate constant , and we will discuss about their magnitudes and we go next to the auto acceleration gel effect .	3.596543041807315

And then finally we will talk about effect of temperature and polymerization rate and as well as effect of temperature and molecular weight of polymers .	4.9421358884677975

In last lecture we introduced different types of chain reactions possible and we also convince our self that if there is a chain transfer reaction , expect if the chain transfer is by the reaction with a polymer chain dead polymer chain .	4.071473660131688

In all other cases the chain transfer happens then molecular weight will come down .	4.506222723605387

And how we can determine the number of residual initiator residues per chain and how that is related to the number of degrees of polymerization .	4.6725731677631055

Now , let us continue the discussion having the last lecture on the chain transfer reaction .	4.302551159857889

Now , we had discussed this , these molecules and their reactivity , now as we are discussing that if the more stable radical will have a tendency to react or undergo transfer reaction compared to the less stable one .	3.3578584680850136

Now , let us look at the values of this solvents C s is the chain transfer constant for the solvent .	5.02363848924355

So , the higher the value the higher is the tendency for that solvent to undergo transfer reaction .	4.126662265404589

Now , we have listed here the values for two monomers , polymerization two monomers polymerization styrene and polymerization of vinyl acetate .	3.14165889766699

And look at the value , you will know that this is the more stable radical then this secondary radical then this one then this and in this case because again this is a primary radical .	4.847644454430896

So , look at the number again benzene cyclohexane toluene if you increase go toluene to ethyl benzene isopropyl benzene the tendency of transfer reaction goes up .	3.0027427839380785

And again we go to tarsalbutyl benzene , because again it is a primary radical , we are talking about if the tendency of transfer reaction goes down .	3.707359938189631

Now , this happens to vinyl acetate as well , but look at the comparison between vinyl acetatestyrene , vinyl acetates are the numbers for vinyl acetate are R , so higher .	2.6905137454920225

So , tendency of the solvents for transfer reaction for vinyl acetate is higher compared to a polymer reaction of styrene .	4.0700737268847265

Now , what could be reason between the difference in this tendency of the solvent towards different monomers , again as we discussed in the last lecture if this propagating radical is very reactive .	3.2238629786999717

Then obviously , it will react for both the monomer as well as the solvent in this case if it is less reactive then it will choose the most feasible root .	4.530813077328636

So , this will react much more to with the solvent molecule in this case .	4.420386441539362

So , that is the reason this is this transfer constant as much higher value compared to styrene .	3.881937116912369

So , if we want to list or rank between different monomers , the rank of the reactivity would be something like this it is vinyl chloride higher than vinyl acetate , acrylo nitrile methyl acrylate , methyl methacrylate styrene and so on .	2.3746355499634637

So , you can yourself from your knowledge from organic chemistry you can justify this ranking , because this is the most reactive radical generates from vinyl chloride will be much reactive compared to the other ones .	3.3831152801235937

This lacks any significant stabilization mechanism either by resonance or by inductive effect , whereas , a styrene will have stabilization radical generated from styrene will have the stabilization by resonance .	2.331857293831694

So , the reactivity of that radical will come down .	5.30365941284738

Now , this is this ranking does not hold always there are cases where there is a specific interaction or putting a affinity between monomer molecule plus solvent , there is specific affinity between this .	2.704620654503715

If for example , if the monomer is electron donor it will have more tendency to react with a solvent which is electron acceptor , whereas if the monomer is a electron acceptor it will have a tendency to react with electron donating solvent , for let us compare between two monomer and two solvent and see whether , we can justify or we can have this verified from the experimental data .	3.4923771812931848

Now , I consider tri ethyl amine as a solvent now it is electron reach , so electron and c c l 4 which is electron acceptor solvent .	2.4930253853104234

Now , I compare between acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate , now acrylonitrile is a electron accepting monomer , where this is electron .	3.3574737224748605

So , obliviously this will have more tendency for react or undergoing transfer reaction with c c l 4 than trim ethylamine .	2.970499403035576

And between this two monomers acrylonitrile have more tendency to undergoing transfer reaction with amine compared to vinyl acetate .	3.2008051034512954

So , if you compare the values and put a third monomer M M a methyl methacrylate which is again a electron accepting monomer and let us see whether it is more generic .	3.167501069447192

So , acrylonitrile will prefer reacting with this as a transfer reaction compared to this whereas , vinyl acetate will be reacting more with this than this .	3.3622019453125582

So , compare vinyl acetate it has more tendency to transfer reaction with C C L 4 , but the acrylonitrile has more tendencyto undergoing tri methylamine .	2.4610793089707825

Now , between then comes a competition for same solvent two monomers because this is donor it will have more reacting transfer reaction tendency with acrylonitrile .	2.6922193160850703

So , you can justify the values for methyl methacrylate , which is again a electron accepting monomer .	3.4913429091463244

So , in what is the utility of transfer reaction or what is what it can help you in this learning on transfer reaction if .	3.980497897948354

Say if you are your trying to polymerize a monomer and then at the end you are not able to get the H high enough molecular weight which you planned from your experiment .	4.094205231886457

Then what are the possibilities it could happen if it does not build molecular weight ; that means , and you know that from the monomer structure that it is it is polymerizable by say radical polymerization root .	4.0398556883090295

Then it there could be transfer reactions happening it could be happening with monomer initiator or solvent or they could be impurities present in the reaction medium .	3.415512667888908

Now , if you can remove you can do the reaction once again remembering all the impurities and still if you can get or you do not get the higher molecular weight , then what you need to look for is the structure for initiator and the monomers solvent .	3.9392575928061

Whether they can take part in the transfer reactions and you have to rule out the possibilities , if you rule out all the possibilities have the transfer reactions by appropriate choosing the initiator and the solvent .	3.313376066116741

Then you can you can built the moleculate if it is the transfer reaction is because the monomer then then there is no other alternative we have choose different monomer al together .	3.6718427136365412

If there is a transfer reaction is happening with the monomer .	6.429118527353255

Then they is other way you can build them monomer molecular weight , because you have use the monomers to meet the polymer .	3.483406924586594

Now , if you found in the reaction they is high very high molecular weight , which you do not what then what you can do you can use this chain transfer agents which we have .	4.430271393058704

Now , what would be the chain good transfer agent which can easy participate in chain transfer reactions and those does molecules like S S N thiol , now containing S S N thiol .	2.509304249168854

For example , if I look the values for one butane thiol this number is very high , because in this case this is a very week bound .	4.400783868713763

So , easy this hydrogen can be very easy accept by the propo vinyl acetate radicals , why using this type of chain transfer tri ethyl are butane thiol compounds the compounds you can reduce are control your molecular weight much to of your choose or if your target .	2.3907099631588533

Now , if you look at this solvents carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra boride they are also have very high chain transfer constant .	3.1926609044307717

The reason for this monomers are the solvents to participate in chain transfer reaction is because of there stability of stabilization of the resulting irons .	3.485712115570619

So , if I have for example , I talk about one participating transfer reaction it produce this radical .	3.7244728499503594

Now , this is can be easy stabilized by all this roaming molecular , which can participation the reguise instructed .	2.4361330029065518

So , this that is the reason that this type of solvent carbon tetra chloride and in specially carbon tetra boride participation the chain transfer reaction very much high extent .	3.3770035997598686

So , always avoid in this type of solvent for alginated only in that sense because alginated solvent will always breezily it can be easily acceptable .	3.2426702818979933

Now , always its try to avoid these acrylonitrile solvent specially for this carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra boride type solvents .	2.4376128460135953

Now , if I look at that transfer reaction one more time , so if I take a mu , so YB inter x a am writing YB and now it is producing M n Y plus B dot , k z is the red constant for reaction .	2.451717083532368

Now , if this b dot which is this radical is very stable that it is does not take part in further reaction , further chain in reaction , it might degrade or it may react with itself forming non radical sphere .	2.8214128664813076

But , it does not react with the monomers to initiate he chain molecules a new chain or if it is at all reactive with monomer the rate is very , very small which means practically in this reaction transfer reaction you are producing a death chain .	3.1823406926978

In this case what happen if k z is much higher then k p which means that this reactions this happening at much higher extent compare to the normal propagation reaction then you will not have a polymer at all , because as soon as this chain initiate it will react with this and form a death chain .	3.4681049061365443

So , we will not have at all any polymers , so polymer is get inhibited .	3.8066413579367864

So , it is a inhibition reaction and this YB is a inhibitor if k z is little higher or may be comparable with k p , then are even part of the M n is under going this reaction and part of the M n is undergoing normal propagation reaction .	2.892785311283186

So , what happen your rate of polymerization it become slower , so this is retardation and the molecule called retardence .	3.444064335423994

For example , if I talk about a self initiated thermal polymerization , polymerization of benzene styrene a 100 degree centigrade this is percentage of conversation and this is time , is normally have reaction rate of reaction like this by time more propagation happenings .	2.602438302412574

So , more monomer is undergoing polymerization reaction , so higher is the conversation .	3.989618182711818

If I had this is 0 percent any external molecule there is no external molecule in this case , if it is 0 percent 0.1 percent benzoquinone , benzoquinone this is benzoquinone .	3.5122027113910246

So , what happen for some time there is no polymerization reaction at all the monomers is not consuming at all , which means as soon as radical is form it is reacting with your benzoquinone present .	3.1214402159395926

So , there is no polymer no monomer is converting in to polymer once this benzoquinone is over then the polymerization reaction start normally .	2.9437723345969915

Now , this is a typical example how this common monomers are shift or store , because most monomers when there are shift from between different countries are locally there are stabilized with small amount of this inviters .	2.4715349978988135

For example , hydroquinone or benzoquinone , because there should not self polymerizes either by little bit of heat oil from the binateor or by self initiation reaction .	2.261178434170702

So , when you do reaction base to s to disallowed that benzoquinone hydroquinone stabilizer or inviter or you can add little excess initiator compensating the inviter molecule .	2.483909806659105

So , that we do the reaction till all the benzoquinone and hydroquinone gets consume after that normal reaction happens .	2.740882845868375

There is a third possibility is like this 0.5 percent nitrobenzene nitro benzene in this case reactions starts from beginning , but with the much smaller rate .	2.874655533374133

So , it is a example of a retardation there would be four possible , which is a combination of inhibition and retardation something like this a starts at a sometimes as well as the reaction is slower , this happens if we add 0.2 percent nitro benzene .	3.595525374873457

So , this as a the reaction possible with different types of this is the typical or happen if your inhibitor or retardation or a combination of both of that and examples of inhibitors again this is when this radicals is very stable .	3.2783688663571056

For example , if I have a butyl butylated hydroxy toluene , when this forms a radical where from a hydrogen you can am not writing you can imagine that the dot will come here .	2.415576451897395

And which is extremely stable radical which does not participate in the nutrition reaction it might degrade or react with self , but it does not participate example of a inhibitor .	3.045491885225359

The other example is like 2 2 Di Phanyl Picryl Hydrazyl DPPH , when it reacts with this this is extremely it does not react with any monomer it reacts with the only radicals and form a non radical specious this benzo hydroquinone can react with a propagating radical .	2.942534067504306

And from either this or this radical both of the , which her resitable radical .	3.070075150443269

So , that is a reason there act as a inhibitor molecule .	4.4085272790768615

Another very common inhibitor which we come across at always is oxygen .	3.529186569065885

So , that is the reason , that the transfer coefficient or or the transfer constant is very high for the reaction that is the tendency of oxygen molecule to undergo this reaction is very extremely high .	3.9165280836654786

So , which means that when you do reactions chain polymerization reaction , radical chain polymerization reaction is must remove the oxygen molecule from the reaction medium as much as possible .	3.553117568199954

To avoid this killing of the radical propagating radical by which it will stop the reaction and also reduce the molecular weight .	4.124846617739565

So , we have now learnt transfer reaction and inhibitor inhibition relation and retardation reaction as well ; now let us talk about how one determine this different rates experimentally by experiment .	2.7178480760982016

Now , R p which is the disappears of the monomer or reaction of monomer from the reaction medium , you can directly determined the monomers consideration by talking a alicot from the reaction medium .	3.473050978073305

And precipitating the polymer and then waying the polymer to find out the healed , which means waste is the monomer , so by which you can know what is the monomer present or how much monomer is reacted directly do at from a solution .	3.493650695486348

So , direct aligcot can be taken at different time M and the polymer can be fastigiated out from the reaction ; second you can directly measure the concentration either by spectroscopic technique or any chemical techniques .	2.981759372895037

Now , it can be applied not only for radical polymerization these experiments can be done for step polymerization as well .	4.2331076965942405

Where you can stop the reaction in between and find out the functional group , in case of step polymerization by in case of these is the conservation monomer molecule , so from this you can get the value of R p .	4.452406245703367

Now , we get it once s more time this the expression for k p is just for your reminder that this is this .	3.8784834533095642

So , we know this now from the experiment and we can find out the concentration of aim as well , so this k p and M dot are the two unknown quantities .	3.83971331762726

Now , this M dot in in theory or in principle can be found out directly from a sides measurements which get the total initiator concentration specially at that stage , this stage .	2.4049207929213146

For because the life time or the life time of this radicals are very small is normal user technique is not very accurate to find out the concentration or M M dot the valve of M dot .	3.186542221266391

So , a sides does not give a very accurate results of the M dot value .	4.011032257488054

Now , we know R I is minus d I by d t .	4.0085643882103446

So , we can find out the I initiator molecule concentration of time , so we know we know the value of R I .	4.264042694487139

So , we know the value of f k d this known now this is known this is known , so you know this is for thermal thermal polymerization .	4.145954857461532

So , you we can write the expression one more time for the rate of polymerization for thermal polymerization is k d I by k t to the power half .	3.9125400970075264

Now , in this expression e e know this , we know this we know this , we know this , we know this , this is all known .	3.140066876867432

So , what is unknown is k p by k t by half , so this is unknown quality , rest of the things we know from experiment .	3.581225872202815

So , now , this can be we can put this value of R p here , so we can get k p M by twice k t R p at steady state , so if you know tau s we know k p by R p .	3.8336033858120437

So , from the value of tau s we know k p by k t this is known this is known , so this by this as to be unknown this is unknown .	3.170833519865113

So , we know this , so we know this we know this if we both are known then obviously k t is known and k t is known k p is also known , so this is the logic .	3.6102011004808556

Now , how do you determine this there two establish method , one is rotating sector method and second is PLPSEC , which is Pals Laser Polymerization Size Exclusion Comotography plases lesere polymerization size exsultion conmoetrgraphi .	1.8044549771005907

Now , am not going in to detain about this method how there how there use to determine the value of tau s , but because this is not the scope of the courses , but if for your knowledge that this are the method are applied to get the value of tau s .	3.20484478791797

And now once you know the value of tau s we know this and we know from this expression this , so we know k p k t .	5.3996338269574835

So , now we know that by experimentally we can know the rates the individual rates we know R I , we know R p , we know R t and we also know k d , k p , k t we know all this from experiments .	3.0965368461685814

Now , what is the typical values of this what are the typical values for radical polymerization R I is twice f k d I k d is 10 to the power minus 6 10 to the power 4 second typically used .	3.523410402640496

So , R t comes around similarly r P M M dot M dot value typically is between 10 to the power minus 9 to the 10 to the power minus 7 hole square liter , k p is 10 to the power 2 10 to the power 4 liter mole inverse second inverse so R p value is R p value is minus 4 by minus 6 mole detain inverse .	2.7755447639114528

And R t is twice k t M dot square M dot value is listed here , k t his 10 to the power 6 10 to the power 8 liter whole inverse second inverse .	2.8305373391483033

See , if you compare the values typical this are the typical values now the values would be different for different monomers and solvent choices .	3.3668448863961222

And also it would vary on depend it would vary on various methods , we have utilized to determine this values .	2.693013363719253

So , depends on the method depends on the monomers and the choice of solvent , but this are the typical values of the different rate constant and rates .	5.04752164034037

Now , look at this number k d is very small where k p is much higher compare to k d .	4.471383365352756

So , the destination are the initiation reaction is very slow k p is first .	5.070702471946722

So , the propagation reaction is fast and termination reaction is much faster .	5.880540885405065

But , it does mean the rate all rate of termination is faster because the concentration of M dot his very low rate constant is very high the intrinsic the reaction his intrinsic very fast but because the concentration of the radically specious is very low the rate of termination is also low and that actually enables is to reach a steady state .	3.164525055265465

So , again just for one more time that the initiation rate constant his much lower compare to a propagation chain propagation which is much faster reaction very termaist much faster even faster reaction .	2.8029777834802365

But , at this state there rate of rate of inhibition and rate of termination becomes 12 because the concentration of M dot is much lower it is about 10 to the power minus 8 moles per liter .	3.9838236184266247

Now , what are the assumption if did use this expression R p his k p a M , what are the assumption we made one was that initiation was slow , propagation his fast and termination was even faster .	2.4373278947987687

We had convinced our self now with the values of individual rate constant that our assumption was not , not in accurate assumption was accurate .	2.7393674349232033

We also assume that the individual rate constant for the propagation steps where equal .	4.818453920964861

That means , the reactivity of a propagating radical towards a monomer does not depend among the length of the polymer chain at the end of which the radical is present .	4.040481327458771

Now , once the H O thermic reaction happen , if we do not have arrangements to take out that heat which his evolve chain the reaction , then there will be change in temperature .	3.2841855754070224

If we cannot take out that heat which his generated by the exothermic reaction giving the polymerization process why effectively , then the temperature is raise and once the temperature we raise all this red constant will also vary .	2.694854170380353

So , the rate of polymerization is also vary , if we cannot take out this the heat which is generated due to polymerization reaction that we did not consider did using at this steady state kinetics .	3.0246081886214595

Now , if I consider this then how this rate will look like .	3.825819093599842

So let us plot R p verses conversation for a bulk polymerization ; that means , 100 percent polymerization again , remember R p is k p M M dot .	3.0263068186086968

Now , initially before the steady state happened M dot increase slowly before it steady state happen .	2.9776104998362043

So , with very low conversation to take little time to , so that his the transient non steady state , before the steady state happen .	2.567285686514576

This transient happen this is the transient is is transient it does in take much longer time , does not take too much conversation to achieve that .	3.040550870241111

Now , once this steady state reached R t will be all most constant , but with time what happen to concentration aim , monomer consideration decreases steady state means the concentration of M dot is fixed the time .	2.698292226856422

So , no change in the concentration of M dot this is constant and steady state , but with more and more reaction happening , more and more conversion is happening .	3.8197950038908313

M n M should put down concentration monomer should go down , so R p go down slowly , so it go down slowly .	2.7523152730162264

Now , if at this movement the the medium viscosity is quite high what happened if the if the medium viscosity as become very high , so that the chains are not diffusing at the same rate when the viscosity was lower .	3.289673735564522

Now , we know to termination to happen termination is a by molecular reaction between say to to propagate radical , we know termination would be by add a coupling or by this propagation reaction .	2.321693198348623

Now , if this two cannot defuse fasten off to find each other and react then obviously the termination rate will come down , it will become diffusion control ; that means , the intrinsic is very fast .	3.1333138244892726

But , the rate at which this two radical his finding each other is determined the diffusivity of the this molecules .	3.152224672161106

So , the termination reaction becomes diffusion control the higher is the diffusion higher is the termination reaction , but because the medium viscosity is quit high , so diffusion rate is low .	3.279297673867297

So , the termination reaction his low now once the termination reaction his low steady state is lost .	3.198197005782764

So , more and more radicals are not terminated now because here the termination his come down , so the concentration of M dot increase .	3.1962014328766832

Because , the viscosity is very high if the reaction the termination reaction his become diffusion control it is difficult that the propagating radical finding difficult to by other propagating propagating radicals to undergo a by molecular termination reaction .	3.2184396995562308

So , the reaction the concentration of the radical the propagating radical goes up .	5.585787900720494

Now , once this concentration goes up what happen to the rate if this goes up rates goes up rates goes up now we know del H is negative exothermic reaction , once rate goes up goes up more and more heat involved and more heat involved means will know in a minute that of if we increase the temperature the medium rate of polymerization even goes up .	2.8163455020126245

So , whatever if there auto acceleration is happening because rates goes up rate of polymerization goes up more heat is generated more heat is generated we cannot take out effectively that because the medium is high .	2.7445580168459194

So , temperature goes up as a temperature goes up rate of polymerization again goes up , as a rate of polymerization goes up more and more heat is generated .	4.271089705526687

So , basically there is auto acceleration the rates zooms the rate of polymerization becomes to much accelerated as a results you get a gel at the end .	3.2817775860499814

So , you get a gel is very high viscous material , so it is a gel effect this called gel effect , this is gel effect or is called effect , this is steady state .	3.4499651293065945

Now , for a bulk polymerization this rates comes down rustically at the end will come and discuss why in a minute from now .	3.307485442852896

If you are doing reaction in the solution then if you are concentration in the monomer in the solution is slower , then viscosity does in go up that much and because the polymers are forming in a solution the heat management is very good .	4.318674233329341

So , there is not heat acumination as a low increase in temperature , so the gel effect does not happen .	3.193458642541405

So , we plot a methyl methylacrylate polymerization at 50 degree centigrade in benzene by benzoquinone polyoxide initiator it is look like this time percentage conversion .	2.6067927825212145

It is basically gives the rate of the polymerization times verses conversion gives you rate of polymerization .	4.026917376776872

If you do it in a little higher say about 40 percent you get like this if you say 60 percent is the 60 percent monomer in the solution , you gel effect 80 percent you get even before the this 100 , 100 percent conversion , this is bulk .	2.842190880276782

This conversion verses time gives you rate of polymerization if you do it at a 10 percent concentration then the rate goes down slowly , but no gel effect happen if does in happen for 40 percent as well .	2.7880308936899274

What if the concentration of the monomer is very high 60 percent , then there is a gel effect .	6.68297134177619

If it is even higher the viscosity for the medium becomes very high even at low conversion at lower time .	3.3851320721943057

At 80 percent at gel effect initiates as much lower conversation at lower time or even for bulk which is 100 percent monomer it happens even before that .	2.4441011931883136

All the monomers present in the medium there have not polymerized , now what would be the reason now we know glass transition temperature I have not discussed in this till now will discussed in later .	3.033100573725766

But , time being glass transition is a temperature at which a polymer becomes soft below which polymer become glassy .	3.0915982138007747

So , the mobility of the polymer chains becomes very low below the glass transition temperature the mobility of the polymer segments is very low and they have no translation emotion there is no translation movement of the polymer molecules .	3.9424124980801523

Now if you do the reaction at the temperature which is below T g now T g for polymethyl methyl acrylate is little excess then 100 is close to 100 .	3.3171122656184844

So , if you do a reaction say at 50 degree centigrade or 60 degree centigrade that his below the T g glass transition temperature .	3.9862939809849975

Now , T g of the polymer also becomes slower in presences of solvent in this case M M a as a monomer , which is called plasticization which is basically the reduction of T g in presences of any solvent in this case solvent is the monomer itself .	4.1707633984093535

So , it is Tg is drops down as long as reaction temperature is below above T g of the polymer in that condition the chains or mobility .	3.5451100146758265

So , the kinetic chains have mobility .	5.251858980313643

So , there can react with the monomer and participate in a polymerization reaction the movement the reaction temperature becomes below of the T g of the polymers in that medium the polymers lose all the mobility .	3.456642128172881

So , reaction stops the polymers becomes classy , so no low reactions can happen .	2.910346962019168

And this reduction of T g from original 100 degree for polymethyl methyl acryculate we be lower reduction means the T g value will becoming down more and more if you have more and more monomer in the medium .	3.222356001110127

So , if I this is temperature and this is 100 degree centigrade is your T g for t n M a in this case this is mole friction of the polymer , if this monomer mole fraction of the polymer is one then the T g would be 100 degree centigrade for the pure polymer .	3.9012832448619466

If you have little amount of monomer then T g will come down plasticization will happen more monomer more plasticization .	3.183321729775541

So , you if you draw T g with mole fraction you are going to get like this , so this your glassy part .	3.1032220545764786

So , in the bulk polymerization as this is the point where the T g as become lower T g of that polymer present in this case as become higher then the reaction temperature if the reaction temperature is 60 degree in this case 50 degree .	5.084220401511503

So , reaction m is 50 degree for T g this polymers as become higher than 50 degree , so no more conversation can happen ; at this conversation T g of this polymer present T g of the polymethyl methyl acrylate present here at become higher then 50 degree which is the reaction medium .	2.853560657517901

So , once the polymer become glassy then the polymer chain the kinetic chain are not participate for the reaction and cannot take the cannot make new polymers .	3.755427367022728

So , in this glassy region the polymer cannot the temperature is below the glass transition it cannot make any more further any more it can take up participate in further polymerization .	2.605297482604001

So , what we going to do in the next lecture is we what to find out the effect of temperature in the polymerization rate .	4.351038875939327

And also the effect of temperature on the molecular weight of the resulting polymer and will talk about thermodynamics of the chain radical chain polymerization in the next lecture .	4.384788825366414

We will continue today our discussion on enzymatic catalysis and particularly the ways in which the enzyme can lower the free energy of activation of a chemical reaction it catalysis .	3.480837121132197

In our earlier lecture we have noted that enzymes can lower the free energy of activation of a reaction very effectively as compared to chemical catalyst .	3.1538802521709504

However this catalytic efficiency is attributed to two major molecular strategies that we had discussed earlier and they are binding of the substrates to the enzyme on the active site mainly the major play ground here is active site present on the enzyme molecule .	3.3050936778820432

On the other hand the stabilization of the transition state of the chemical reaction which is the desired reaction which you want to catalyze .	4.916465620564728

Here I like to draw your attention about active site .	3.948449593860917

You see in both cases the active site on the enzyme molecule play a very key role in the variety of functions or variety of mechanisms that we will discuss today .	4.078213237406045

Before we go in to main mechanism I like to summarize some of the characteristic features of enzyme active sites at least the major one which may be of interest in today ’ s lecture .	3.1471510702328986

The enzyme active sites determines the catalytic properties and specificity of the enzyme and these properties are determined by the chemical groups attributed by the amino acids present on the particular small region what we understand as active site .	3.152115311228751

This region , the so called active site may constitute less than 5 % of the total surface area present on the enzyme protein .	3.4899112896383158

It ’ s a very small area on the total enzyme surface and rest of the enzyme surface either in its proximity provides some favorable reactions or very often it may be considered as only a sort of building framework structural feature which creates the active site .	2.8810089078087664

The creation of active site on the surface of an enzyme molecule is brought about by tertiary folding of the enzyme protein .	4.265388141148206

All the enzymes we talk about are all globular proteins , structural proteins are not involved in catalysis and therefore the rest of the amino acids by virtue of their folding pattern creates certain niches , certain crevices , cleft on the surface of the molecule which acts as active site and the functional groups attributed by the amino acids in that cleft take key role in binding as well as catalytic process .	2.9876460616994986

The active site is usually located in a cleft or crevice .	3.432384617087547

Active site although present on the surface has its own three dimensional entity .	3.996115404634349

It has two distinct functions binding of the substrates and catalysis and both the functions are a result of the amino acid residues present there primarily and then the shape , which is brought about by the conformation .	3.1800579085200185

The enzymes exhibit remarkable specificity because of their precise fit between their binding sites and their substrate .	3.0136863654392734

Considering the active site it is a combination of two functional entities : one is the binding site , substrate binding site plus the catalytic site .	4.746484223139415

Enzyme protein , as some of you may be aware , has enough number of ligand binding sites .	2.984115879030965

Substrate binding sites are one of them .	7.443666463148287

The active site consists of the substrate binding site plus catalytic site .	4.818029908507242

It does not catalyze the reaction it will only remain as a ligand binding site .	3.5157835588089745

That is the order of magnitude which the binding energy goes in the binding of the substrate .	4.5582874175216315

Another feature is that not all the twenty amino acids that are present in protein are involved in active sites .	3.744649956924092

Just by observation of the variety of enzymes which have been studied so far , it is noted that only a few amino acids usually polar in nature they participate directly in catalysis - cystein , histidine , serine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid and lysine .	2.5154575063190245

You can see that all of them are polar in nature and these are the usual amino acids which constitute the primary functional groups on the active sites .	3.6247135492132574

In some cases the terminal carboxylic and amino groups are also involved whenever by tertiary folding they come in the proximity of the active site .	2.878155838350874

Not that on the terminal side if they are far away from active site they will play a role .	3.244463482379736

Once by folding process if they come and become a part of the active site , the amino and carboxylic groups are also important in the catalytic function but again they are also polar in nature .	3.1828936245637314

By meaning that they participate directly in the catalysis I mean that they are present at the active site .	4.444645457002446

The involvement of certain amino acids at the active site is a result of the whole folding process in which all amino acids are involved .	3.7200342637928068

So while we say that these are amino acids that are present on the active site and they participate in the catalysis does not mean that the other amino acids which are playing a role in the folding process have no relevance .	3.386954786248255

If one of the amino acids is transferred or removed the whole folding will change and primarily involved means those which are physically present on the active site .	3.0935629983907043

But their presence in the active site may result from the whole composition of the protein as well as the folding process .	4.371450887213713

Another feature which we need to keep in mind is that certain enzymes require cofactors .	3.7631347110329245

The precise reason for that is amino acid side chains cannot catalyze all the chemical reactions .	3.106461850104491

That is one of limitations although the protein design or the enzyme design has been so beautifully evolved that a large variety of reactions can be catalyzed but still there are limitations .	2.648502442881163

One of that is that the available twenty amino acids are not able to catalyze all the reactions .	4.7041757391500765

The limitation is on the electron acceptors .	6.015309421564142

None of the amino acids are good electron acceptors and many reactions which are primarily based on electron acceptors require additional input in the form of cofactors .	3.3457652684170665

For example the cofactors like NAD , NADP , they are all ideal electron acceptors and they participate in the catalytic process simply by oxidation , reduction or whatever mechanism is involved .	2.465066615318314

Therefore small organic molecules or even metal ions provide electron acceptor or some other chemical potentialities in addition to proteins for catalytic function .	2.775427995277229

So that is one limitation that while most of the reactions can be catalyzed by the amino acids present on the active site , certain reactions which are not possible to be catalyzed by this can be carried out by cofactors and that provides a key role for catalytic function .	3.5587312245621883

Just to recall our earlier discussion on the previous day we mentioned that the energy of activation E * can be broken down into two components that is your enthalpy contribution as well as entropic contribution .	3.0570682286081072

We can break down the reaction and the classical Arrhenius equation , the expression for rate constant can be written as k = RT / Nh exp ( ?	4.299614714913789

S * / R ) exp ( - ?	14.182466357112967

H * / RT ) The rate enhancement process consists of two different components or the energy of activation consists of enthalpic as well as entropic contribution .	3.2457209016754347

So by any means if the enzyme can either reduce the enthalpic contribution to the free energy of activation or entropic contribution , the net result will be a catalytic function .	3.8456186276766746

While considering the various ways we will consider the lowering of energy of activation through each of the contributions and first we will see lowering of energy of activation through entropic contributions .	3.3097293547739297

Consider a bimolecular reaction in which A and B participate to from AB * as a transition state .	3.0999577256331383

The entropy of these molecules will consist of translational as well as rotational degrees of freedom .	4.110330984446238

Three degrees of translational freedom and three rotational for each of the molecule A and B .	3.6729442691958867

The two molecules will have six degrees of freedom .	4.4191382405957285

Once the reactants A and B bind to an enzyme molecule at the active site there are only half of the their degree of freedom that means they become one entity and they lose six of their degrees of freedom and thereby there is a loss of rotational and translational entropy and the transition state will have only three degrees of rotational and three degrees of the translational freedom each .	2.699723169468676

You must understand that the net result of binding of the two reactants to the active site involves in reducing the degrees of freedom of the two reactant molecules and therefore there is a loss of entropy .	4.12446892184586

In the case of A and B acting in the absence of any catalyst , in our case we are considering enzyme as catalyst , when the transition state compound is formed there is a loss of entropy .	3.5896666692432015

Now this loss of entropy is accounted for in the energy of activation .	3.2961923016436074

Whereas in the case of enzymatic catalysis the loss of entropy as a result of combining into one entity is attributed in the binding process which are already taking place in the binding process .	3.455379312633611

When the enzyme substrate complex forms a transition state there is no loss of entropy affecting and the loss of entropy as a result of enzyme binding compensates for the reduction in the free energy of activation .	3.765908008358963

This binding energy can be of the order of about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 at 25ºc and if you take the two reactants at one molar concentration , the computation will tell that it will be about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 .	3.4755959045508087

Simply by entropic contribution of binding the enzyme can reduce the energy of activation by about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 .	3.7115103074096667

Just to repeat , we should consider two different cases .	4.074954271501839

In one case A and B are present in a solution in which there is no catalyst .	5.683739778813304

Ultimately for the reaction to take place they have to pass through a transition state .	4.787853336192184

It will lead to loss of entropy and this loss of entropy will then be accounted for in the energy of activation .	3.1467495841799833

This loss of entropy has to be provided in terms of the energy of activation .	5.685874238130499

But when you talk about enzymatic catalysis this loss of entropy is compensated by binding process .	3.431710936594209

That means whatever loss of entropy is there in the binding process that is not to be provided in the energy of activation .	3.7269480463915765

There will be loss of entropy but that will result in the range of energy during binding process .	3.58424269268128

Whereas from the bound enzyme substrate complex to go to the transition state there will be no loss of entropy and that entropy gain will account for advantage in the entropic contribution to the energy of activation and this is one of the major contribution in reduction and activation energy as a result of substrate binding .	3.558255322169515

One point must be kept in mind that such an advantage due to entropic contributions for the energy of activation will be more pronounced if they are multi substrate reactions .	2.9328882434295487

If suppose there is a unimolecular reaction one may say that there is hardly any advantage .	4.279103848448511

There are hardly any unimolecular reactions as far as an enzyme is concerned expecting certain isomerases because most of the reactions are bi or trimolecular .	3.381871556003421

There are some , but not many in numbers .	3.8818568602089494

In the case of unimolecular reactions this entropic contribution will not be very significant .	3.99925671458669

There will be another mechanism which will play a role .	3.872827550708833

The reduction in the activation energy is not through one mechanism .	5.2796355783630515

There are various mechanisms and the net gain is sum total of the kind of mechanism that are involved in specific enzymes and in case of unimolecular reactions the entropic contribution may be quite insignificant .	3.327946105028965

The binding of the substrate to the enzyme molecule is not a process which is within the purview of activation or transition state .	4.532447326228766

The enzyme substrate complex must not be confused with a part in the transition state complex .	4.424195578264518

It is a totally different process which , particularly the enzyme substrate complex is a result of a large number of non covalent interactions between enzyme and substrate , hydrogen bonding or Vander Waal ’ s forces .	3.0023347557236324

Whereas from the enzyme substrate complex to transition state is a totally different phenomenon and the energy required to go from an enzyme substrate complex to transition state is the amount of activation energy required for the reaction .	3.740425392161817

The binding energy is a totally different game and therefore that should not be confused .	3.9583276995844328

Very often we might make a judgement that the energy which has gone into enzyme substrate binding is not a part of activation energy , is not required for catalytic process , for activation energy to be equalized .	3.1110855806328095

This effect of entropic contribution to the energy of activation is called approximation effect or propinquity effect .	3.271821534017649

You bring the reactants into to a close box so that they act as one and they function .	3.4432317859659793

As a result of this approximation one can also consider another feature .	4.376106505708167

When the substrates are bound on the active site the effective local concentration of the two reactants in the active site will also be much larger than the concentration in the free solution .	4.341946346015727

The substrate is now localized for the reaction at the active site whatever is the volume of active site in a given enzyme molecule .	4.586433904636022

This concentration of the reactant at the active site will be many fold higher compared to the actual concentration in the bulk phase in the aqueous medium in which the substrates are dissolved .	4.69892723601656

The higher concentration of the substrate at the active site means that the enzyme provides a new micro environment in which the substrate concentrations are much higher than in the bulk and you get the net effect of higher substrate concentration on the reaction rate .	4.314168825943722

Whatever mechanisms you can use to increase the frequency of collision , it could be the increase in reactant concentration , it could be temperature change , they will all result in increased reaction rate .	3.60792992421924

The net result of substrate binding to the active site which will lead by the approximation or propinquity effect into to a higher substrate concentration will also lead to an increased catalytic rate .	3.294198451121768

The approximation or propinquity effect will lead to benefit in the reaction rate , one by a reduction of energy of activation as a result of entropic contribution and the other is as a result of apparent higher concentration at the active site .	3.6686490600436765

Here also the same situation will apply that these effects of approximation will not be very , very significant if you are talking about unimolecular reactions .	3.630776108837297

The other effect based on the entropic contributions is orientation effect .	4.135501377872646

While we discussed reaction rate theory we noted that collision of the molecule is a pre requisite for reaction to take place .	2.8476431235650708

Not all the collisions result into product .	5.015956723719568

One of the reasons we considered was that the molecules have to posses a certain minimum energy , potential energy so as to reach to the level of energy of activation before they can break down into product from the unstable state .	3.0139138760856725

Another reason of the non - release of product from collisions could be that the molecules during collisions may not be in the right orientation because orientation at the time of collision may also be significant in many cases and enzyme can play a key role .	2.906369048078796

Substrate binding to the enzyme site on the active site may also play an important role in providing the substrate molecule in the right orientation .	4.279615850628891

Orientation effect means the aligning of the substrate molecule on the enzyme active site in the right orientation which on collision will result into the product .	3.517176694083792

In higher frequency large numbers of total molecules that are present participate in the reaction process , a feature which will result in higher reaction rate .	3.6470957540261773

The three dimensional confirmation of the active site takes care of that .	5.104173476767497

That means the evolving of the design of three dimensional structures to which this substrate molecule will fit will be exclusively specific for the orientation which is required for the catalytic reaction .	2.5947937699026618

The orientation could be in the form of certain functional group on the substrate molecule , could also be the correct alignment of the electronic orbitals of the colliding molecules and a small departure from the optimum alignment may result in lower reaction rate or when we say lower reaction rate , increased energy of activation .	2.708686107103026

Theoretically this concept of orientation was considered that the enzyme is able to steer the reactants into a correct orbital alignment at the active site and therefore this effect was also called as orbital steering .	3.030311936004702

The two phenomena of orientation effect and orbital steering are related .	3.124102470768364

Orientation effect is a much broader term in the sense that it will include orbital steering as well as the aligning of certain functional groups on the substrate molecule but orbital steering is aligning of only electronic orbitals in a particular fashion at the site , which will result in the net catalytic function .	2.962123156474898

Mainly these two behaviors , approximation or orientation effects are the major contributing factors in all catalytic reactions catalyzed by enzyme molecules .	2.5258985459357506

If you consider the whole energy of activation , part of it is contributed by entropic modifications and part by enthalpic contributions .	2.8857214089055105

If you just understand the enthalpic factors we must consider that the transition state is like a molecule with some of its chemical bonds in an unusually extended or strained form .	2.8185953187152406

They are unstable molecules .	7.78683077963159

The bonds are partial bonds .	6.3852649102886385

They are not completely formed .	6.500073513373142

Either they are quite weak bonds and either they are in process of forming or breaking somewhere in between .	2.996703536909123

That is what the transition state is .	7.8951129467508645

Any mechanism by which you can take the reactant closer to a transition state not by formation of transition state any other mechanism which can do that will facilitate or reduce the energy of activation .	3.115314931363359

If you look into the mechanism of substrate binding to an enzyme active site something similar happens .	4.3239290319076815

If during the binding process , the reactant or the substrate has to undergo some change in shape in order to fit very snugly into the active site there might be some distortion or strain on one of the bonds which is required to be broken .	3.337421064012096

All these factors will depend on the design of the active site which the nature has evolved in the evolutionary process .	3.544228726461006

None of these active sites have been designed so for at least for commercial purposes or for practical purposes .	2.9676182848046553

There have been some academic efforts to take advantage of anti bodies to provide a catalytic function , to take advantage of stabilizing effect because antibodies have very high values of affinity to their substrate .	2.4297717613438325

Their dissociation constant values are very , very small in the case of antigen antibody interaction .	5.017104363812302

If similar forces are involved they can also act as much better catalyst theoretically .	3.317328772165314

There have been efforts in which this has been successfully proven , of course in very specific cases .	2.952330637018085

Not a very general behavior .	8.460911168602326

Still we depend on the natural design on the enzyme active site for all practical purposes .	4.405354317025874

When you consider the strain or the distortion of the substrate molecule before it can go into the active site for binding purposes , if the desired bond which has to be broken during the reaction is partially strained or distorted then part of the job is already done .	3.514316921754058

Energy of activation required for conversion of enzyme substrate complex to the transition state will be smaller .	4.114814404250161

Consider simply a hypothetical case in which we have enzyme active site shown by this x , z ellipse .	3.504028061700436

A substrate molecule with a central carbon atom and a , b and c functional groups is present on this substrate molecule .	2.907867338872434

These are supposed to bind with x , y and z which are the amino acids residues on the active site .	3.396891683701893

We have considered that two of the functional groups on the substrate b and c are able to bind to y and z functional groups .	3.5290008135069173

But one of them , a is not easily accessible to x in the in the native form of the reactant .	3.618217935171559

It has an attractive feature for binding purposes between a and x .	3.1712216607648998

One of the mechanisms by which enzyme function is that the bond between the a and the central carbon atom gets distorted or strained , such that the binding gets facilitated to the x .	2.9975576966385837

That means that this bond is already now partially broken and if this molecule then goes to transition state the energy of activation required will be much less .	3.501412753510463

In many cases such a thing happens and such a behavior is often called as modern rack hypothesis Today it is proven by many experimental designs that partial breakage of the bond can take place on the enzyme site but in earlier days people have thought of the concept that enzyme tears off the whole substrate molecule which has proven today by modern rack hypothesis and which illustrates that the enzyme can accommodate a substrate in which one of the bond which is required to be broken for catalytic reaction to take place can get distorted partially during the binding process thereby reducing the energy of activation .	2.4738662293745266

If you consider even from energetic point of view let us say the binding process of these three residues requires 5 kcalmol - 1 for example and in the distortion process let us say already 2 kcal have been spent hypothetically .	3.2407730846249216

So for this binding of a to x only three are required .	3.5487730145676024

Instead 15 kcalmol - 1 involved in binding of the normal molecule for the three bonds , you will require only thirteen .	3.4126610269880784

Therefore while going for the activated state , 2 kcal are already saved as a result of partial distortion and that is another mechanism what we call as modern rack hypothesis .	3.116934227112239

That is the component of the x y and z , are all on the active sites .	3.158354954507048

Here if you consider x y and z are the three residues which are the part of the active site which will bind to a , b and c functional group on the substrate .	3.6811536825518374

Two of them are complementary and can easily bind without any problem .	3.5330269177288427

One of them is out of the way and requires some distortion .	3.977726494444946

Enthalpic contribution might reduce energy by 2 kcals .	4.342550518151395

The energy required for transferring the enzyme substrate complex to activated state will be reduced by 2 kcals because 2 kcals have already been consumed in the distortion process at the binding site .	2.9575519929404095

The binding energy should be distinguished from the energy of activation .	3.4155870883222343

Energy of activation is energy required for the catalytic part .	5.032931693584317

Binding part whatever is consumed is different and that doesn ’ t account for because we are talking only one phenomenon , the increase in the catalytic rate and that takes place as a result of decrease in activation energy .	3.29966557793352

The other mechanism by which the enthalpic factors contribute to reducing energy of activation is general acid base catalysis .	3.612607972906351

This is the mechanism which is very often employed even in the case of chemical catalyst .	5.229701995803274

Many of the reactions can be catalyzed simply by acids or alkalis and the basic mechanism is that by certain transfer of electrons or protons to the reactants the catalyst can reduce the energy of activation .	2.3615287601470967

The basic principle of acid base catalysis is more or less identical .	3.9905294295484133

Only difference is that the role of acids or alkali in the chemical catalysis is played by the functional groups on the active sites .	3.7691058450538

This is based on the appropriate positioning of the catalytic functional groups within the active site of the enzyme .	4.029341482227492

Such groups are able to donate or accept electrons or protons to or from the substrate in such a way that it weakens its reacting bonds before the reaction process actually begins .	2.667714503919534

Again a similar theory just like in the case of the modern rack hypothesis we assumed that the binding process induces distortion on the reaction bond .	3.550518279522624

In the case here by the participation of the functional groups or the acids or basis we are weakening the bonds which are involved in catalysis .	3.0444085041088016

Therefore the energy of activation will be reduced by that amount .	4.873986100511265

By providing acid or base groups at the active site an enzyme is able to stabilize the charge transition state .	4.023590108690348

It is quite logical that in such cases it will be mostly the ionic species like glycine or glutamic acid or proteic acid will be the functional group that will be responsible for acid base catalysis .	3.4719823795857496

A very typical example in which acid base catalysis is predominantly found is the action of lysozyme .	2.969152258630802

Lysozyme is an enzyme which breaks down bacterial polysaccharide by virtue of acid base catalysis predominantly .	3.6069847451222814

Positioning of the functional residues at appropriate positions so that it weakens certain bonds can also be considered covalent catalysis .	3.5828941644876253

The difference is that in the case of acid base catalysis there is no covalent bond formation .	5.442282743096366

It is only transfer of electrons or protons to or from the substrate .	3.1118295261732305

In the case of covalent catalysis transient covalent bonds are formed between the substrate and the enzyme or the coenzyme .	3.7628464448932823

Amino acids residues participating in such reactions are serine , cysteine , histidine , lysine , aspartic acid and glutamic acid .	2.513393956305285

They participate by forming transient covalent bond .	4.4171311572767875

That means the enzyme substrate complex which results as a result of these covalent bonds are highly reactive .	3.9602479422511387

They have a covalent bond .	7.520783495428631

Bond energy is not that high and therefore even under ambient conditions by attack of another molecule they can further be broken down to the resulting products .	3.013133022002481

These side chains react by donating a pair of electrons to a centre of partial positive charge on the substrate molecule , a nucleophilic attack .	3.0190365625436186

These pair of electrons looking for a positively charged nucleus donates a pair of electrons to form the desired bond .	2.969062955334322

The resulting highly reacting enzyme substrate complex is then attacked by water in the normal cases if it is a hydrolytic reaction .	3.727858173886577

Again an example of such catalysis is cleavage of poly peptides by carboxy peptides .	3.308024126751221

In some of the examples in this table you will notice that on the first column you have side chain serine , cysteine , histidine , lysine , aspartic acid and glutamic acid .	2.8083119704021566

The enzyme containing serine residue or hydroxyl group on the active site attacks at the positively charged nucleus , the central carbon atom and there by produces an enzyme substrate complex by nucleophilic attack and the type of bond formed is ester type of bond .	2.678883021412185

This is quite a highly reactive molecule .	5.007889550699757

That means not a very stable molecule as a covalent compound and therefore when it comes in contact with water it breaks down into the respective acid or alchol .	2.688632374904729

But on the carboxylic group this serine functional group of side chain of the active site can attack .	3.8027465979768182

Similarly in the case of cysteine the type of bond formed is thioester .	4.0773096707427605

In the case of histidine the bond formed is acylimidazole ; lysine forms Schiff ’ s base and aspartic and glutamic acid form anhydride bonds and these anhydride bonds then can be attacked by the second substrate .	2.169937924152446

Second substrate could be even water and thereby they will break down .	3.672669557394258

In fact a large number of hydrolytic enzymes follow such a behavior including proteases , particularly … .	3.5359246883953905

proteases and lipases or tannase or for that matter n number of other hydrolytic enzymes follow the covalent bond formation .	2.924780612578814

These are some of the major mechanisms by which enzymes reduce the energy of activation .	3.8550780719265005

There are some minor mechanisms also and among the minor mechanisms one is environmental or dielectric effect .	2.3999537578545644

The earlier mechanisms that I mentioned were more or less general in nature .	3.314291537717852

Most of the enzymes involved in those mechanisms reduced the activation energy .	3.8848361548749426

But the mechanism like environmental effect is provided by very specific enzymes only .	2.982119317137615

A not very frequently encountered effect for reducing the energy of activation is attributed to environmental effects .	3.299447141947596

Some reactions occur better in organic solvent which have low dielectric constant compared to water and this may be due to the fact that some of the attractive repulsive forces between the electric charges are much weaker in the medium of high dielectric constant that is water than in those with lower dielectric constant .	2.5357986136017336

Such reactions are normally likely to occur more efficiently in the hydrophobic active sites on the enzyme surface as it can shield them from the aqueous phase .	2.592246617538347

Therefore in such cases enzymes provide a kind of organic or highly micro environment within the aqueous bulk environment .	3.057796328034276

A situation something like that of micelle in which the substrate can be shielded from the bulk aqueous phase and still the hydrophobic environment can be provided to the substrate .	3.294561673905518

It is not a micelle .	9.089720770638095

Substrate is not entering here .	6.317057836543728

The active site is predominantly hydrophobic in nature .	4.816146254377183

It predominantly consists of some hydrophobic active sites , all the residues whereby the micro environment provided for the reaction is hydrophobic and really it is away from the bulk aqueous environment of the enzyme .	2.862805338994036

To summarize whatever we have discussed today , the mechanism where by enzymes lower the free energy of activation for a reaction they catalyze can be grouped under following major heads : Propinquity or approximation , orientation effect so that they are built into a proper orientation either through aligning some of the functional groups or by orbital steering , then strain or distortion effect on the bond which is desired to be broken during the reaction or strategic positioning of reactive functional groups in the active site .	2.470888219356898

This is primarily based on the acid base catalysis or covalent catalysis , a feature which is common to that of chemical catalysis .	3.5327367463553627

A combination of all these effects underlies all enzymatic catalysis .	4.160729106233984

No enzyme follows a single mechanism .	5.743593660407911

They all follow a combination of these mechanisms and the contributions made by each of these mechanisms will vary from enzyme to enzyme and if more than one mechanism is employed to reduce the energy of activation , the enzyme will be able to perform better catalysis in a more efficient way .	3.0723628763810913

So we will stop at this point today .	4.150062941703023

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

And , in this lecture , we will discuss about polymer additives .	5.497743485731062

We will talk about chemistry of polymer additives , and we will give examples of polymer degradation , and how the stabilization is done using externally added additives .	3.2488763289987106

We will talk about anti - oxidants and how they are , how they function in a polymer metrics .	3.853770677871701

We will talk about light stabilizer , and then flame retardants .	3.7353175712705857

Now , let us first understand , why we need to add additives in polymers ?	3.8697282869565783

Why should we care at all ?	5.247040179371394

Now , if you look at the production of thermoplastics alone , they are over 120 million metric tons .	2.832342574978524

Now , out of this entire volume , 95 percent and more would have been useless without stabilization by adding external additives .	2.759591833158742

For examples , this pure polyolefins like polyethylenes , polypropylenes , they oxidize very rapidly .	2.55439353662221

So , basically drawing them is very difficult , unless they are stabilized by adding external additives .	3.3363378218895376

Pure PVC cannot be extruded and molded in the higher temperature , their processing temperature without degradations .	2.5901202509363914

So , if you , if you do not add additives for stabilization , then the polyvinyl chloride , we get out of ; the molded part will have very poor mechanical properties , which is , which are not useful for particle applications .	2.9404308971697124

So , we require stabilization to have this polymers apply , applicable in the applications , where they are currently used .	3.189647296996029

So , the application , the successful application of polymeric materials is substantially attributable to the incorporation of the additives into the virgin resin , we just produced from the reactor .	2.5658880276802205

Unless , if you do not use the additives in those resins which are coming out of the reactor , they are , will come down drastically .	4.042556882904961

What does additives do ?	7.959454836095679

Additives enable the polymers to overcome the processing difficulties ; for example , the polyvinyl chloride , we just mentioned ; it also help in overcoming some performance limitations , and it also protect , give the protection in a polymer from the environment .	2.7663330545593627

We discussed about the weathering condition with ability , where polymer exports are experienced heavy light and other parameters .	2.440846326237891

So , if we stabilize the polymer , keeping those application in mind , then the applicability will go up .	2.571624529960252

Now , how do you choose polymers , which polymer , sorry , additives for a particular polymers ?	3.542905134923101

Now , the nature of the additives we must use or we use , must be depended on several parameter ; for example , composition on the polymer .	3.025029196971092

Processing condition ; now , we must know the processing condition of the polymer for which we want to use the additive ; now , that will that will give the temperature of use and the amount of share .	4.09251655966484

So , the additives , which we are using , or you planned to use must survive those conditions themselves .	3.593822255679739

So , if we use some additives , which do not survive the condition of the processing of the polymer , which you are interested .	4.769005981384899

Then , obviously , the additives will not function after the molded part or the final part is made .	3.126147061172337

And , obvious ; and also , the interaction between the additives and polymer might be different at that higher condition , higher temperature and higher share rate .	3.465426304727005

So , those things has to be kept in mind .	5.818941051322148

And , we must remember , if you are talking about the stabilizations specifically , you must remember the mechanism by which the polymers are degraded , when subject to heat , light , shear , moisture , either during the processing or during the manufacturer , and during its life cycle .	2.696397756935704

So , basically , if you want to stabilize or if you want to have a polymer made with the help of , with addition of additives , and we must know the mechanism by which the properties of the polymer deteriorates with the , in presence of light , heat , shear , during the processing or during the use of the polymers in actual application .	3.62979776329883

Normal chain growth polymers like polyolefins or polystyrene , polyvinyl chloride , they have these carbon hydrogen bond , carbon chloride bonds ; these bonds are very prone to degradation by a variety of environmental agents .	2.4599311000044306

So , we ; so , these are the polymer generally require protection against oxidation , light , and protection again against a UV light and thermal degradation , etcetera .	2.6290146647960393

So , these are example about the chemical structure .	5.254208267538565

We need to keep in mind , the chemical structure of the polymer when you design a additive .	4.260736012800203

Step growth polymers , generally do not have these bonds which are very prone for degradation , but they do have the functional groups which are prone to hydrolysis , like this ester groups , amide groups , or carbonate groups .	2.7354539564084805

They are , these groups typically hydrolyze very easily , and specially in presence of impurities , metal impurities , and acids and brushes .	2.6379764463058133

So , this polymers actually undergo molecular degradation in process , presence of moisture .	2.956579754586028

And , these hydrolysis , such hydrolysis is favored during high temperature processing .	2.971183119519449

And these are accelerated by , this hydrolysis is accelerated by the presence of residual catalyst .	3.301446119956133

And , additives are also added to import new and enhanced properties like , in the polymer like , fire resistants , static dissipation , improvement in mechanical properties , to compatibilize blends and so on .	2.5444415925694335

So , there are many more examples , where the property of the polymers are enhanced by use of adding external additives .	4.20968606151827

And , typically in a polymer formulation , more than one additives are used .	5.972685822104445

And , so , a understanding of the mutual interaction between this additives are essential for making an optimal formulations .	2.9287231155404756

And , generally , this small organic additives , they worked by sacrifices , sacrificial mechanism ; by meaning , by terms sacrificial mechanism meaning , that they do destroy themselves and protect the polymer , the main polymer which you want to maintain or retain .	2.3823759722254993

So , basically they destroy them self by doing some chemical reaction , and sacrifice them self to protect the main polymer in concern .	2.5960293934599656

So , that , they , we can classify the polymers in several ways .	4.400776086707603

And , we can , for example , we can classify them as a protective , protective additives ; which , they are the additives which prevent , or delay , or in or influence , the ageing process or degradation process in the polymers .	2.8813047364312996

And , some of the additives used are antioxidants , which basically prevent against oxidation ; heat stabilizer , which prevents degradation of polymer under heat ; light stabilizer , which basically protect the polymer from UV radiation .	2.571449825067679

Anti microbials , which protect polymer from microbes , bacterias , and so on ; metal deactivators , which basically deactivate the catalyst residues or metallic impurities residues , which basically help in , or which basically degrades the polymer , during its use or in processing time .	2.1610510306642796

Structure modifier : the additives which modify or influence the molecular or super molecular structures , like compatibilizer , they help in making compatibilized blend ; cross linking agents , which obviously , introduced or added to bring cross linking between polymer chains ; nucleating agents , they basically added to increasing , increase the crystanality ; dispersing agents which are used for dispersing some fillers in the polymer metrics ; foaming and defoaming agents , which are added to make foamed polymer product .	2.1029060072320056

There are additives , which are used in polymer formulations , which basically assist in processing and fabrication , or in assembly , like lubricants , mold release agents which basically help in reducing the mold from after the brat is formed processing head , adhesion promoters , scavenger and acid neutralizer , catalyst quenchers ; they are some other examples , general examples of this type of additives .	2.119301845293704

As I said earlier , that there are numerous , numeron additives are added to increase the property , or they enhance the properties of polymers .	3.68953076527631

And , there , there could be list of many such additives ; for example , flame retardants which help in reducing the flame flame ability of the polymers , impact modifier , antistatic agents , antiblocking agents , anti fogging agents , optical brighteners , pigment and colorants , coupling agent , plasticizers , reinforcements , so many things can be added to enhance the property .	2.2080451721320493

And obviously , you cannot add all these for every polymer .	3.5973911301411383

And , it depends upon the final applications ; if your applications required a flame , a polymer which is flame resistant , then you must add a flame retardant to it .	3.0305681706965872

And , if you are making a polymers , which will be like a packing film for food trapping application ; then if you , if he is having anti fogging additives , then it will prevent fogging a condensation of the water moister in the packing film , which will basically allow the customers to look through that film .	2.74536286316407

If the anti fogging agents , so , additives were not present , it will condense , and the customers could not be able to look through that film ; so , that will basically be a bad property of the film .	2.764586439643331

Now , before we discuss ; in the chemistry , there are some issues about the additives we must consider is , how do they function , the mechanism ; obviously , chemistry plays a major role in this .	2.632582301208967

And , cost , though the amount of additives are added in small quantity , but typically they are much costlier than the base resin .	3.124141323633727

So , basically , one must remember or must consider the cost of the additives used .	3.9695986737270688

Even though the amount of the additives used are less , but because of their higher cost compared to the base resin , the cost of the polymer formulation would be higher .	4.38805882731163

So , the optimum loading of the additives is what required .	4.567115045734578

And , you must know the interaction of the additives with the plastics ; what is the , how they interact with plastics , interacts with other additives ; as I said , the multiple additives are used ; same times interaction with other additives are also be important .	3.175462142839752

And . long term issues : like , how they function , there long term longevity , and they are effect in the environment ; they must , this should be considered ; for example , if you are using some the packaging film for food application , then the additives should not leak out and contaminate the food .	2.590697756388606

For example , if you are adding some additives for some medical application , then the additives should not come out and contaminate the medical devices .	2.759653791095765

So , so that should be considered before the polymer is used .	5.506781144145472

How it is handling ?	8.346191883992958

Handling of the additives also concerned .	7.312766151981578

For example , liquid additives are normally difficult to handle .	3.5154574833434795

If you are using a polymer powder , and if you want to add liquid , the dispersing , dispersion of the additives in the polymer powder is difficult .	3.9719736972734654

So , how , you must know , how you will handle the additives which you are going to add in the formulation , and how you are going to mix it with the plastics , that is important .	3.1779113353626545

Let us take an example about polymer degradation .	4.454097008127884

We are discussing that polymer might degrade in presence of UV light , or in presence heat or light .	3.229388709697747

Now , let us talk about one of the common example of polymer degradation and the stabilization ; and let us take example of polyvinyl chloride degradation .	3.7129345257575554

Now , these are the ; this is , as you know , this is the structure of polyvinyl chloride , but along with the main chain , there could be some other units in the polymer back bone .	4.948479477081296

They are , the number is very less ; it is given 4 , 4 to 6 out of 1000 repeat units , 0.2 to 1.6 out of 1000 repeat units .	3.4586945678946246

So , basically , these , this irregularities are very less in the polymer chain , but the degradation is mainly caused by this irregularities itself , not the main polymer chain .	3.1801648059746155

So , the unsaturation and the tarcaric chlorines are very bad for thermal stability , for polyvinyl fluoride .	2.3886996501555084

And , these unstauration or the terminal chloride , terminal chlorine , resins of terminal chlorine arises due to the chain transfer reaction during polymerization .	2.9111408090045483

And , it is very difficult to avoid these reactions .	5.735132594583651

And , these sides serve as chlorine radical source , which basically initiate the degradation .	2.9234284339371777

So , the main degradation happened by dehydrochlorination as shown in this figures .	3.3079589004570567

The main degradation of polyvinyl chloride happened due to the dehydrochlorination at higher temperature , and that starts with chlorine radical .	3.350429118729172

And , if you have these consecution over 5 , 5 carbon atom or 5 double bonds basically , then it will produce colour .	3.5589233083609

And , these degradation is accelerated by , in presence of light , heat , oxygen and presence of acids .	3.0061663068728115

And , colour may form , also from these protonated polyenes as it is shown in this figure .	3.033478244846293

So , basically , if you want to stabilize polyvinyl chloride , you basically want to have a mechanism by which you can trap chloride chlorine radical , or you can destroy this allophonic or arylic double bonds which is producing , getting produced during the degradation process .	2.713519047506575

So , how the stabilization is done ?	5.433971627875401

They convert these unstable arylic , allyl chlorides to non allic , non allyl sites ; and example dibutyl tin disulfides , and their chemical reaction with the allylic double bond is shown here .	2.2422620621587623

So , they form this arylic , allyl chloride to non allylic sites and prevent degradation .	2.6379005798054598

And , there are additives like dibutyl tin maleate , which basically break up the conjugated double bond , and prevent the degradation further .	2.3690542183643046

The other additives used for PVC stabilizations , like soaps of cadmium , zinc , barium salts ; and , they act as acid scavengers .	2.3993091058607146

Lead salts also act as acid scavenger ; and , they , basically are one of the major additives used in PVC industry .	3.488751883074169

So , this is one example , we just discussed about PVC .	4.937213721685381

And , PVC is a very prone to degradation under processing .	4.801291384687186

So , this one example ; is a very good example to discuss about polymer degradation and stabilization .	4.611338449139478

Now , let us talk about one more class of additives - anti oxidants .	3.071035538705306

The anti oxidants basically retard the oxidative degradation process of polymers , which is initiated , the oxidative degradation is initiated , when free radicals are created in the polymer material by , either heat , UV , mechanical shear , or metallic impurities .	2.4843330046434615

So , anti oxidants basically retard the oxidative degradation process .	3.4399896749334857

Now , to know the anti oxidant additives which are used , let us discuss the basic autoxidation scheme for a minute .	3.5618242210416375

So , let us go through and look this basic .	4.539075643258208

The first step is basically initiation .	6.071615844217786

So , you have a initiator forming a initiator radical which might abstract hydrogen from polymer backbone , forming a radical in the backbone .	2.9601573120272984

Next , normally the propagation happen ; propagation step , where it reacts with oxygen forming peroxide radical ; and , this radical start the further chain reaction , forming further radical .	2.6346166872516554

Termination of this chain might happen by reaction between the radicals ; basically , reaction between 2 radicals .	3.6369388632062423

Now , if there are , if R has an alpha hydrogen ; if R has an alpha hydrogen , it can further form epitomic type moiety .	2.5370337756090007

So , this happens , this reaction only happen , that R has alpha hydrogen .	2.948926385029003

The others , other secondary and branching reaction can also happen ; secondary and branching reactions , hydro peroxide can give other radical ; if R is tertiary , tertiary , if R has alpha hydrogen .	2.4088027346449126

So , these are the basic auto oxidation mechanism by which oxidative degradation might happen .	3.3381610105935677

It is , as you can see , it is a radical process ; now , to prevent these ; so , if you want to design an anti oxidant , you basically have to attack or stop all this processes .	3.4329705618968185

Now , anti oxidants are added or designed , which cannot attack or prevent all these steps , but it might prevent some step in between .	2.397558550855753

So , one thing can be possible ; if you want to use or stop these auto oxidation , you might reduce the concentration of the I radical or the R dot ; you can reduce the concentration of I dot or R R radical ; now , that is basically out of our hand , because the processing and the other external conditions we cannot control .	2.84140391184354

So , what we can do ?	7.296601609645717

We can trap this R dot ; or , say , peroxide radical , and that is done by primary anti oxidant .	4.068966863640957

So , primary anti oxidant , basically trap this R dot and peroxy radicals .	3.265727147824267

We can increase the rate of termination reaction ; and , that is done by addition of hindered amines .	5.88914776155821

Now , we can also do , and decompose the ; first stop this step ; we can decompose these by non radical pathways .	2.7352353741404793

And , this is typically done by use of secondary anti oxidants .	3.993379891859396

So , basically , we know , what are the step in oxidation process or to oxidation processes ?	3.6036680462253003

Normally , inefficient propagation termination and secondary and branching reactions .	3.695485889494038

And , to prevent that , what are the things we might do or it is typically done ?	4.310711084731177

You can always reduce the radical concentration , but it is not in our hand .	4.942208109872476

So , we can add the additives which can trap this radical R dot or proxy radicals , which is done by adding primary anti oxidant ; we can increase the rate of termination reaction , which is done by adding hinder diamine .	3.41553577281504

Or , we can decompose this hydro , hydro peroxides by non radical path ways .	3.021327412132728

And , that is done by adding secondary anti oxidant .	4.539951167475531

Example of these primary anti oxidants , hinder diamines and secondary anti oxidants , and how they do this trapping or decomposition or increase in the rate of termination , we will discuss briefly now .	3.031711311172259

So , primary anti oxidant , as you said , as I just mentioned , it traps this R dot and proxy radicals .	2.937704571784492

And , there are several types of anti , primary anti oxidants : one is hindered phenols ; they basically terminate the proxy radicals , as I just mentioned .	2.5726222471397637

And , they themself are non discolouring , but they can form chromophoric structures , after they , to this hydroxyl , a proxy radical trapping .	2.3834594215921427

One example , the common example is BHT , butyl hydroxotolovine ; structure is shown here ; they are used in this type of anti , primary anti oxidants are used very much for styrenics , vinyls , and elastomers .	3.011459229855817

But , the drawback for these primary anti oxidants , that they form a very volatile low molecular rate phenolics .	2.8384511143185804

So , they might get lost during the processing conditions .	4.762170845415338

So , these are the mechanism by which they work .	5.844951024462809

For example , these are additives , trap this radical , form a radical by themselves , which can rearrange , and react with the other radicals , and form non radical species .	3.1829126613203402

And , these final species like stilbene quinine , benzo quinone , they basically are sometimes colour bodies .	2.5490590809199802

So , then this additives themself is not , or they would not decolour the polymer , but final compounds , when they form after stabilization , that could generate colour in the polymer matrix , that is the one drawback .	2.596959078418025

And , one each radical , basically capture 2 , 3 radicals , and by which they basically prevent these oxidation process .	3.026918648490115

Some other mechanism continuing in the , from the last page , how this type of butane hydroxyl tolovines capture or trap the radicals are shown here .	2.856717586180867

So , basically , they capture or trap the radical produced ; and , by doing this , they basically reduce the oxidation process ; and , the only drawback is that they sometimes form a coloured compound , in doing that .	2.4597647354661283

These are some examples .	8.52072714062805

There are many many phenolic anti oxidants available in the market .	3.7701897156376405

These are some example shown here .	4.96485181791553

They are this phenolic anti oxidants .	5.34077315932499

And one thing , it can be noted , not only for this anti oxidant , for all other additives as well that , it is not always a , that all this additives will work for a particular polymer or all polymers .	3.4550774873098717

So , basically there is some trial , and experiments one need to do , to find out the best possible additives for the polymer you are looking for .	3.704426009006095

So , there are some experiments must be done , looking at the mechanism by which the stabilization or the additives ; what function you are adding the additives for , that is done .	3.127727942088331

The aromatic amine antioxidants in the diamines , which basically , as we said , increase the rate of termination reactions .	3.5883679620044635

So , they are amine , secondary arylamines function by hydrogen donation , and they act has chain terminators of peroxide decomposition , decomposer .	2.1701492726784237

The drawback is that they might , it is produced colour bodies , and that will discolour the polymer matrixs .	3.061826572151771

But , these are the some examples , I am keeping on ; there could be many many more examples of this type of additives , but this is just for your knowledge that these are the possible way of using additives , and how they actually do their job ; for example , primary anti oxidants by trapping the radicals , and these by increasing the termination reaction .	2.9808910889329225

Secondary anti oxidants , they are hydro peroxide decomposers ; react with hydro peroxides and produce non radical products .	2.5981510140756154

And , examples are like trivalent phosphorous , divalent sulfur compound , containing compounds , phosphites , thioesters , these are the common examples of secondary anti oxidants .	2.619024172642954

For example , how they work phosphites ; they basically decompose these hydro peroxides , and form non radical products , and thereby decreasing the concentration , decrease the concentration of hydro peroxide .	2.714957652419083

Hence , decrease the auto oxidation process .	5.357381684814615

Some commercial phosphite anti oxidants are shown here .	4.080695668073398

Again , there are many more ; and , there is no buyers for these anti oxidants , from my point .	3.589435222603431

These are just examples arbitrarily chosen from the literature .	3.532825463045081

Now , we mentioned , I mentioned that the step growth polymers are , have those functional groups , like esters , carbonates , or amides .	3.156887828397081

For example , this PET is shown here ; polyethylene terephthalate polyester , they can react with water and hydrolyze .	3.4912711488737322

And , hydrolysis process , basically reduce the chain length .	4.979087169028752

And , once the chain length is reduced , molecular rate goes down , and the properties of the polymer also go down .	4.7242057277265825

And , this happens , as I mentioned this , for linear polyesters , polyamides , polyurethanes , polyureas , polycarbonates , where their functional groups have , groups which are prone to hydrolyze .	2.475238462733172

And , they catalyst by presence of acids or basis we know organic chemistry that hydrolyzes is catalyst by the presence of acid and basis , and vinyl polymers do not usually undergo this type of hydrolysis .	2.521596892615414

And , these are the one example of the hydrolysis happening during the processing condition at higher temperature , at higher shear rate .	4.034353850803031

This is for a polyethylene terephalate , which has been dried for 100 degree centigrade at 20 hours ; that means , the moisture content in this polyethylene terephalate sample is very less .	2.985626615561745

So , during processing , the hydroxylation , the hydrolysis is less , so the molecular drop .	3.4561446461919667

Hence , the viscosity drop is less .	5.589724363807073

Whereas , if , is take a undried PET , which have significant amount of moisture in the sample , then it actually hydrolysis very soon in that high temperature and high shear condition , during processing as a freezen molecular weight drops , and viscosity of the sample also drops .	2.398971558775751

Let us talk about , next , light stabilizer .	5.029560707135671

The most engineering plastics or hypo of polymers , they contain aromatic groups , which intensely absorb UV light around 290 nano meter ; and , this is most susceptible light in , this wave length corresponds to 95 kilo calorie per Einstein energy ; and , that can break most of the chemical bonds .	2.4366548610558363

So , basically , absorption of UV light is basically determinant for the polymer molecules .	3.576718417974656

And , once the bond cleavage starts , you can get lots of chemical bodies forming , which absorb the UV , visible near , UV visible range forming yellow colour of the polymer .	2.603058052026874

So , you can use 2 types of , 2 or 3 types of UV stabilizers .	4.014253644949162

One , UV is UV absorbers which basically absorb and effectively screen the UV light from interactive with bulk of the polymer matrices .	3.1013437039464637

Other types of UV stabilizer , hindered amine light stabilizer HALS , which basically arrest the chemical chain reaction resulting from the free radical , which basically are free radicals scavengers .	2.3819861207502

And , this 2 can be added together , sometimes to have a synergistic benefit for engineering plastics .	4.123843965441231

Let us take example of photodegradation of one polymer .	4.389680313414302

In this case , we , let us talk about polystyrene .	5.692082305102578

So , with the exposer to UV light , it turns yellow ; as a result of that , bond cleavage will be high energy UV light ; and , as the result , the polymer becomes embrittle .	2.9023028451176476

And , this degradation of molecular happens faster in outdoor conditions , because it has exposed to the UV light , much more extent than indoor conditions .	2.4785091214801303

In case of polystyrene , as we said , that it is the presence of aromatic groups which basically responsible for absorption of UV light , and that actually causes ring oxidation and which can basically initiate the polymer degradation process , as shown in this figure .	3.13377999176066

And , another example of photodegradation of polycarbonate ; if you take BPA polycarbonate and keep it outside , for 1 to 1 and a half hours , it turns yellow and becomes hazy and brittle of that time .	2.4461863170308633

There could be rearrangement , molecular rearrangement due to absorption of UV light ; or , it could be , in this case it could be due to photo oxidation product , and these basically produced highly coloured product .	2.979304475525056

So , the polymer matrix becomes yellow , and this process also , the polymer property polymer molecular drops , and the property of the polymers become significantly lower compared to what it was originally after the molding .	3.1313814153326733

And , these are the some examples of organic light stabilizers .	5.075343864838994

Again , there are many stabilizers available in the market .	4.846150728190865

I just took few examples .	6.395744113107584

And , their UV visible spectrise zone , as you can see , from the absorbance , they actually absorb heavily in the UV range , because they absorb ; they actually prevent the bulk of the polymer from getting exposed to the UV condition .	2.7129696502808263

Now , the mechanism of these absorption , UV absorption happens that , they basically absorb , and then at excited state , protons transfer happen ; and finally , they form a new excited state , which , from which they , by radiation less process they come back to the new ground state .	2.4600334943779214

So , this is example of that photo stabilizer in normal ground state ; and , with absorption of UV light they go to a first exited state , where a proton transfer happen ; and , finally , a radiation less process bring them back to a new ground state .	2.2375017849874808

So , by this mechanism , this is the mechanism by which this organic light stabilizers function as a photo stabilizer .	3.9003727565211563

There could be inorganic lights stabilizer or photo stabilizer as well , for example , carbon blacks ; and , they have particle size from 20 to 40 nano meters ; and , they are very effective absorber ; but , obviously , they can be , all be used in samples , which are meant to be black .	2.6657603746761263

Titanium oxides , it is another UV absorber , which absorbs highly below 370 nano meter .	2.83855388529333

Another example could be zinc oxide and iron oxide based , some other pigments also can be used .	2.850970039577448

But , these are not ; this is the normanic life steps ; there are though , they protect from UV light , but they have some other problems which basically prevent their use in practical applications .	2.932855426310359

So , these are the inorganic light stabilizer ; they do not get used very frequently in applications , in real applications .	3.2965350656894095

The other stabilizers , like hindered amine light stabilizers , we just talked about , which basically prevent the radical process .	3.020383792502175

And , some of the commercially available hindered amine light stabilizer results are shown here .	3.2786028427439944

These are the again represented in examples of some light stabilizers , commonly used in polymers .	2.9382312098171917

Now , what we will do ?	5.08887464663955

I will finish of , for this lecture at this moment .	3.960390694239223

And what we will do ?	6.569670802122307

I will , in the next lecture , which we will be going to be the last lecture of this course .	5.259115872939697

We will talk about the other types of additives , like this fire retardants , how they work ?	3.8528188932915843

What is there mechanism and surface migrating of additives ?	3.5846961378826103

And , we will talk about polymer blends , little bit briefly ; and then , go to the concluding remarks for the course .	3.1757348084448562

So , let us stop here for this lecture , and we will complete the course in next lecture .	3.2537931630700223

So far we have discussed various facets of enzymes starting from the chemical and functional nature of the enzymes , reaction kinetics , methods of immobilization of enzymes followed by the design and analysis of immobilized enzyme reactors merely from the point of view of their application in process industries and today we will take some examples of these applications particularly in process industries .	2.9861889659319742

That means the use of immobilized enzymes as industrial biocatalyst in the industries .	4.223197126651629

Well I will try to illustrate with a couple of examples which will give you an idea as to why we have been looking at the use of immobilized enzyme compared to either soluble enzyme or chemical catalyst .	3.575057582665918

You will also appreciate that the use of enzymes particularly for an industrial application are often limited to the sections that are listed here .	2.9924173305432546

Typical examples are hydrolysis of starch , hydrolysis of penicillin to produce six amino penicillanic acid .	2.9391284875235004

Incidentally bulk of the applications are in the field of hydrolysis that means hydrolytic reactions .	3.880066016600036

Although there are examples where other groups of enzymes have been used in an immobilized form for carrying out industrial processing their large scale applications have been so far limited .	2.714441884539746

Bulk of the commercial application have been in the area of hydrolytic enzymes with the exception of glucose isomerase which is in the isomerase category .	2.9467473807196614

The other group of application sector is analytical applications .	3.7866477602981954

Enzymes here have a very important role to play because of their specificity and many of the analytical situations which are enormously difficult in the case of chemical analysis can be handled very accurately and dependably by use of enzymes and to economize the operation of the analysis , the role of immobilized enzymes becomes more important .	3.2576533168456185

The immobilized enzymes will also find use in sensors that means the electrodes if you want to have an analytical tool in the form of an online sensor in that case one looks for the immobilized enzyme preparations which can detect a particular product of interest .	3.014042245275379

The typical examples are the urease waste kidney that means dialysis unit , where dialysis units have been modified to include immobilized urease to facilitate the dialysis for patients who are suffering from kidney failure .	2.056141252646508

The other one is on the use of aspergillus for leukemia patients .	4.341823506331818

Another application sector is bioseparations ; the typical example is affinity separation which is based on the covalent coupling of one of the ligand for effecting the separation process .	3.0688668034594984

A very specific method is applicable either for very high value products or where the number of stages required are very large , they can be minimized to a small number .	3.281358347246386

You have a whole range of small applications in different sectors probably the most prominent among the miscellaneous groups I will like to place is biological …… treatment .	2.579161931372514

Many of the specific systems require intervention of enzymatic catalysis for safe disposal of the waste emerging from a particular industry .	2.4743414124564023

There might be very small applications here and there where immobilized enzymes might find useful applications .	3.293087817240625

Today we will be looking at the first application sector where they are used mainly as industrial catalyst .	4.119617342045922

For their use as a industrial catalyst the important factors which have to be kept in mind are the yield of enzyme from native source ; the original enzyme itself has to be chosen which is desirable for any industrial process both interms of operational characteristics as well as the effect of other impurity or other conditions which prevail in the feed stream .	2.5174963697648787

They must be able to tolerate it and the enzyme must be available when you say yield I am referring to a term which incorporates the cost part ; because higher the yield , the cost can be lower .	2.9341703549365388

Then the second factor is cost of carrier and reagents for immobilization .	3.547743183819268

The immobilization method , the carrier and the reagents required for immobilization is another factor which contributes significantly to the suitability of the use of an immobilized enzyme preparations for industrial processing .	3.169623977280333

Then activity of immobilized biocatalyst , the final activity which has to be used for catalysis and operational stability of immobilized biocatalyst , the factor which determines the whole process economics .	3.584079990518728

Finally regenerability of the carrier is a factor you will notice in one of the examples which I have given today that although the carrier is very expensive the cost factor here as we have mentioned may be high but if it is regenerable the cost can be taken care and does not contribute very significantly to the overall cost of the process .	3.2757078772781325

So regenerability can be a very , very positive feature and in most cases that has been the key factor .	4.607891181669467

If you look at variety of industrial processing that go in processing of foods , animal feeds those industrial factors which use primarily natural products as the feed stocks our enzymes are going to play a major role in those industries where the feed stock or raw materials are from natural source .	2.047247574962029

That means the contents , carbohydrates , lipids and proteins or some other biomolecules which are often attackable by the enzyme molecules .	2.9677713973327333

Some of the factors which in addition to the earlier components of an immobilized enzyme process which have emerged by virtue of experience in various processes are also like this .	2.9427252384435594

For example if you consider the enzyme and the three factors the cost , reuse and stability then the immobilized enzyme systems are very , very suitable for high cost enzymes ; the cost of the enzyme is very high .	3.7493332793980234

In the case of enzymes with low cost even the batch system soluble enzyme may be suitable .	2.9585943322369235

An enzyme like alpha amylase is one of the example for low cost enzymes and is used in soluble form in batch reactor because you can afford to discard it ; you need not recover it whereas high value enzymes are most suitable to be used in immobilized form and here when I say column system I am covering both either by packed bed or even it could be depending on the process a CSTR also ; but here the column gives only column .	2.480351680517365

The reaction control in the case of soluble enzyme and the batch immobilized enzyme is usually difficult which makes it very easy in the case of a continuous flow immobilized enzyme reactor .	4.044977760194332

The product purity also has a role to play in decision making of the use of immobilized enzyme otherwise product purity can be very high in the case of a immobilized enzyme used in continuous reactors because there is no contamination from the enzyme protein .	3.293591980065798

Some of the side reactions are likely to take place in the case of the continuous reactors and the residence times are usually lesser than the soluble enzymes or the batch reactors because the advantage of the smaller residence time in the continuous reactor as well as the absence of any contamination from the enzyme protein provides you a product which is much more pure compared to soluble enzymes or an immobilized enzyme in the batch systems .	3.6259800056781244

The equipment part is slightly unfavorable in the sense that in the case of continuous flow immobilized enzyme reactor the initial capital investment or equipment may be comparatively higher compared to a batch soluble process or a batch immobilized process .	2.849319398385749

The same thing applies to automation .	5.434773201885416

In the case of batch processes there is no automation whereas continuous processes can be automated and which can make a lot of saving in the labor cost and running cost that means the labor cost are related by per unit weight of volume of the product are relatively low in the case of continuous reactor systems using immobilized enzyme and the processes with immobilized system can be easily scaled up compared to the batch processes which might find variations from batch to batch .	2.9364907375363973

These are the various parameters like the enzyme itself , the reaction , product , equipment , running cost and advantage of scale and one has to analyze a given process on the basis of these parameters and then take a decision whether it is desirable to go for a soluble enzyme batch system , immobilized enzyme batch system or immobilized enzyme continuous system .	2.769328683988848

This example probably was the first commercial process used anywhere in the world using immobilized enzymes .	2.726106805571816

The same process was used in Japan using a soluble batch enzyme over a period of about ten years and they were producing L amino acids by using the amino acylase soluble enzyme produced from the microbial resources but in those soluble enzyme batch processes , the problem of purification was very , very severe .	2.1688791209364426

That means usually the product stream after the batch processes will be contaminated with an enzyme .	3.3477752888046033

It has to be removed because these L amino acids which were produced were useful either for food applications or animal feed or sometime pharmaceuticals and therefore you cannot leave unconverted or unused proteins in the feed stream and the number of stages involved in purifications will lead to loss of yield for the amino acid as high as fifty to sixty percent .	2.53621938541044

Therefore there the shift from the soluble enzyme to immobilized enzyme became a very great incentive to bring down various facets of cost and having a much cleaner process this can give a better quality product , much higher yield , ease of purification and all those advantages .	2.2678112187040815

Normally when these amino acids are synthesized by chemical route , they are residual mixture of D&amp ; L and we get in final stage as DL - acyl amino acid .	2.6743179829411265

When I am saying L - acyl amino acid this R could be anything the whole range of amino acids specifically in most cases depending on the amino acids there is a corresponding amino acylase .	3.534400142146668

Some of the enzymes are little less specific .	5.917618377396349

the particular amino acids to give the L - amino acid ; it gets deacylated and you get L - amino acid and D form remains untouched .	3.3011436768393225

You get a mixture of L - amino acid and D - acyl amino acid .	4.174531386055481

These two molecules have a very distinct difference in their solubility at different pH ; very distinct .	3.2683386738290636

So adjustment of pH and taking advantage of solubility the L - amino acids can be easily crystallized and produced in a very pure state without much of head ache of removing proteins or deactivation of the enzymes or separation of unconverted D form .	2.67992939869784

The same process also gave a side effect or rather a very important tool to produce D - amino acids because if the D - acyl amino acid separates out after crystallization , it can even be chemically hydrolyzed to produce D - amino acid .	2.363829783794926

There is no problem and D - amino acids are used as a raw material for many of the keto acids which are used as a raw material in pharmaceutical industries .	3.4890605995880155

Here the process of economics becomes very attractive because while you are able to isolate L - amino acid with a much better yield you are also able to use the residual material D - amino acid either if it is required for keto acids or alternatively this can again be racemised chemically or just by change of pH it gets racemised again to a DL mixture and the whole process can be repeated till almost hundred percent of the amino acid E is recovered in the L form and you get the corresponding fatty acid also produced in the system which is separated from the mixture .	2.807859515615475

Methionine acylase from aspergillus orgy was isolated and immobilized by using a variety of methods and if you look into list they had used physical adsorption , ionic binding , covalent binding , cross linking in the presence of carrier , lattice entrapment and micro casual entrapment .	2.62493416537904

Almost all the methods are employed to immobilize the methionine acylase .	3.6841016031503826

If you compare all the methods based on the initial quantity of amino acylase used , the activity recovered in the immobilized form and the yield level activity , the method based on immobilization of amino acylase by ionic binding to DEAE sephadex proved to be the best in terms of its enzyme activity ; seven thirteen units per gram or what ever unit they have used and with “fifty eight point nine percent ” yield of the recovery of the activity from the soluble enzyme as compared to various methods where the activity recovery as well as the final activity of immobilized preparation was much lower .	2.5191939485944026

The next comparable ones were entrapment in polyacrylamide gel , covalent binding to some aryl amino glass , diazotization , but if you look into the cost of immobilization in terms of cost of reagents , covalent binding was expensive .	2.8515706298531414

Gel entrapment was cheaper than Sephadex but when you look into the operational advantage you will notice that even expensive carrier was desirable and acceptable .	2.8237861239869164

For designing the whole commercial process they looked at two major parameters effectively although we have much better strategy and understanding of the various design parameters for the immobilized enzyme reactor but in the process two more parameters were considered ; the effect of space velocity on the concentration of amino acid in effluent .	2.899752507426436

A space velocity is analogous to dilution rate in the CSTR and so you will notice here that the same enzyme was able to act on methionine as well as phenylalanine .	4.1391490976390495

So in the two cases on the right hand side is the hydrolysis of L form .	3.7988451017015654

In fact at a concentration of point one molar the reaction is stopped when almost hundred percent hydrolysis of the L isomer was completed and the kind of profile you get is almost a sigmoidal profile and at a space velocity of approximately about eight hour inverse the reaction was complete and that means hundred percent of the L isomer was hydrolyzed and recovered .	2.338273919073923

If you notice here some of the experimental conditions , amino acylase was immobilized by ionic binding to DEAE sephadex “0.2M ” concentration of substrate was used containing 5x 10 - 4 M cobalt salt which acts as stabilizing agents , stabilizer for enzymes and reaction temperature was 50 deg C .	2.4236986318399607

Another parameter which they considered was the pressure drop ; probably that they considered to find out the height of the column and they noted also that the pressure drop across the column bed followed very typical fluid dynamics expressions which are available and it was proportional to the space velocity as well as height of the column .	2.8931926033883744

They selected the height of the column based on the pressure drop limitations so that don ’ t have to face very severe pressure drops .	3.1863851013997704

Particle size was chosen according to that .	4.469112613041124

They did not make any further analysis based on mass transfer or anything else .	2.931141976723756

Space velocity and pressure drop was the key parameters that were studied based on which the whole reactor system was designed and operated continuously .	2.7835522076717925

As you notice here this is the storage tank for the racemic mixture which comes from chemical synthesis .	3.6708750634218026

Then the final product from the packed bed column goes to a concentrator where it is concentrated just to take advantage of solubility and crystallization and the L - amino acid gets crystallized and the crystalline L - amino acid is separated .	2.835693026352712

Crystallization is being used as the method which is a very favorable method for purity of the product .	5.2533000971462

The D - acyl amino acid is then separated and is taken to a separate tank for racemization where pH is changed and racemization occurs and this mixture is again fed back to this tank as a racemic mixture and the whole process produces almost hundred percent conversion of DL to L - amino acids .	2.3457511422606308

Alternatively there have been attempts where the D - acyl amino acid can be chemical hydrolyzed to produce D - amino acids which are also raw material for keto acids in the pharmaceutical industry The operational stability and the regeneration of the carrier are the points which I was addressing .	2.565987050785333

The actual data is that they have quite a stable performance in the sense that in about thirty two days of time of continuous operation more than 70 % of the activity is retained .	2.9494211821302274

As per their plan they regenerated their material .	3.5222666580189035

After one cycle when 72 % of the activity was lost they stopped the reactor ; added more enzymes whatever loss has taken place 28 % enzyme was additionally added and it accumulated so that the enzyme reaches to the original loading capacity .	2.6454391838567695

Again the reactor was started and this can also be done by using multiple columns and instead of using a single column of large capacity one can breakdown the total volume in smaller capacities and stagger operation .	2.597536495962542

We will try to look at the operational part also subsequently .	4.884846286054097

Although while they operated , they operated at a single column with the break in between of the operation but today most of the immobilization enzyme columns are operated in a multiple column and staggered start up mode so that the productivity you don ’ t have to make a brake in between and the productivity and conversion can be maintained almost constant within a narrow range over a period of time .	2.4560033952336378

The regenerated enzyme again went down and it can be again regenerated and this cycle is continued over almost about thirty two days period .	2.7683289853051156

Look at the cost part because it is process economics and this was the data presented by the authors themselves who carried out the commercial operation and if you compare the production cost of L - amino acids by batch which was being operated originally that means prior to 1963 it was a batch soluble enzyme process and a continuous immobilized enzyme process .	2.343127403357489

This is the comparison and this is the fraction of the relative cost .	6.471591608233716

First point to be noted is that the cost of the production of the product has come down to 59 % , whatever was the original cost 100 % of the L - amino acid .	4.150812395980368

This is in the case of methionine and similar analysis applies to almost all amino acids .	3.7013644100539884

If you see the break up you will notice that the there is a significant change in the cost as a result of the raw material .	4.133857716127029

That means racemic mixture of amino acids , D - acylamino acid .	3.8250524263907235

The cost is reduced significantly and that is bottom shaded portion and that is because of the increase in yield .	4.558569116887678

The recovery has improved so per unit cost as a result of raw material consumption has decreased .	2.932591826742895

The second part is the enzyme cost .	7.86151356927438

The third component there is significant reduction in the labor cost .	3.8786928285959466

Two major factors which contribute to reduction of the cost in immobilized processes are enzyme and labor .	2.841441145615134

So that also gives us a clue about the enzymes which are more expensive .	4.200606760928478

Immobilized processes are more favorable if let us say the enzyme cost is not very high this is not going to make a dent on your process .	3.957012920718723

Similarly the recovery process involving labour if it is very tedious again immobilized enzyme processes will be more favorable .	3.845359991925723

So the labor and the enzyme cost are the major factors .	5.5805512688735694

Then the fuel cost ; it makes no difference .	4.127573840930224

Another factor is the blank portion ; the cost of the carrier which is an additional input in the case of immobilized enzyme which does not exist in the case of soluble enzyme .	4.337145130298732

Although DEAE sephadex is very expensive , considered to be probably one of the most expensive carrier that is tested on all materials , the total life of the carrier which they were able to use is almost five years .	2.85604748853487

If you distribute on the total product formation that cost contribution is very , very small .	3.211626064972791

It can attain its own adsorption and they were able to use easily for periods as high as five years .	2.6766157091370446

During process there might be some handling losses and which might reduce some quantity and this factor is primarily because of the handling losses during the regeneration process .	2.7880336913577506

Another example that I like to illustrate is also a normal molecule , production of L - aspartic acid .	3.5072893986275715

L - aspartic acid is a molecule which is used in the food industry and pharmaceutical industry and this can be produced by an aspartase , enzyme lyase which acts on fumaric acid and ammonia to give you the L - aspartic acid and the work was reported by Tosa and others in Biotech Bioengineering in 1973 .	2.7155253803264383

I think you may like to go through and I suggest some of the references ; you just go through them ; you will find the experimental details as to how they arrived at the final decisions .	2.798939142521437

If you look at the same data , as we looked in the case of amino acylase , in the case of aspartase they also carried out variety of immobilization methods including the physical absorption , ionic binding , covalent binding and entrapments .	2.9423454770295425

The activities of the final enzyme preparations and the percentage yield of the activity from the … .	3.944571181676273

immobilization are relatively very low here compared to the original enzyme used .	5.014593749513772

If you notice that the percentage recovery are very , very low excepting in the case of entrapment in polyacrylamide gel which resulted in the yield of over 29 % compared to amino acylase where the activity recovery was of the order of 50 % or more .	2.8566585453550117

Here we have 29 % but still 29 % is the highest and probably one has to accept it .	3.594291032647623

Although they started using immobilized aspartase for producing aspartic acid they discontinued very shortly and shifted to an immobilized cell process where these losses were not there ; they immobilized the whole cell itself and the whole activity was retained and the process was more much more economical than an immobilized enzyme process .	2.078575914970886

This is just one example where I want to illustrate in what conditions you have to shift over .	4.040228165055726

If there is enzyme which is intercellular and the recovery or purification cost is very high probably immobilized cells will provide an answer .	2.805377440427965

On the other hand if the immobilization method is not able to produce or you are not able to get a good method which can recover a good yield of enzyme or the final activity in high amounts in that case also immobilized cells may be an easy or a suitable answer .	2.8034338953376543

The same enzyme aspartase continuous operation in the packed bed reactor gives you the percentage of the L - aspartic acid recovered in the product stream and they carried out at two different substrate concentration 0.2M and 1M ammonium fumarate and the performance over the operating time is totally different as a function of new substrate concentration .	2.8370633064190405

In the case of 1M ammonium fumarate it goes down by 50 % activity in twenty days time .	2.7779661410689194

We discussed two cases of enzyme deactivations during continuous operation of the reactor one was substrate independent where in the earlier case of aminoacylase substrate concentration plays no role and the deactivation constant is predominant but in the case of the aspartase , it is substrate dependent deactivation and higher the concentration of the substrate the operational life is comparatively better .	2.7352800829508443

This is the operational profile .	7.128279725783573

For 0.2M , it deactivates much faster and you see that in twenty days time only 25 % of the enzyme is left , 75 % has got deactivated and here in the same period almost 50 % of the enzyme is present at a higher substrate concentration .	3.8879915929032602

So therefore one has to also look about the deactivation kinetics because that will also play an important role .	3.638252556526398

The third and perhaps a very simplistic example is of the hydrolysis of starch for the production of glucose .	3.5645540631708217

The hydrolysis of starch goes through three different stages ; gelatinization usually a heat treatment process , starch gel which is acted upon by alpha amylase which is very , very economical or very cheap enzyme cost wise .	2.371483646126489

It ’ s a very fast enzyme the specific activity is very high and therefore the enzyme very speedily converts the gel into a liquefied starch .	3.1732857819341675

This is a mixture of dextrins , a small chain length starch molecules ; chain length not more than ten , usually six to eight but the dextrins should not have more than ten glucose units linked together and this is the step which is the rate limiting step in the whole process , the dextrins to glucose by amyloglucosidase or glucoamylase ; it is called as glucoamylase also .	2.6907165866753457

This step has been carried out using immobilized enzyme in continuous reactors so that one can take advantage and the whole process can be controlled by this step .	3.3968123283774174

A very large number of studies have been carried out on immobilization of glucoamylase .	4.222647364609653

The process was designed in US by Weetall and group which was based on adsorption of glucoamylase on to porous silica .	2.445645565726897

Porous silica beads were taken and the enzyme was adsorbed on to that and the cost of the product is not very high so that one can afford this immobilization method ; even if the operational stability is not very high it doesn ’ t matter .	3.5240366334176705

One of the major issues with hydrolysis of starch is in the form of the viscosity of the feed because starch hydrolysis is usually used at very high substrate concentration usually 30 - 40 % dissolved solids which makes very viscous syrup during operation and this viscosity causes a significant problem as for the pressure drop is concerned in packed bed reactors and therefore not many packed bed reactors for these steps are operational today .	2.4894130877633467

Because use of packed bed reactors with an almost 40 % total solids syrup is highly energy intensive and is usually avoided .	2.545172859124686

As an alternative some people have even proposed to use a CSTR where by one can use a stirred vessel , a classical system where one can maintain the substrate feed at a constant reservoir and an agitator pedal , a stone filter just to retain the immobilized enzyme particles and the material is filtered through this stone filter and passes through a peristaltic pump to a charcoal column which removes carbon matter or other impurities .	2.148328648191708

The DEAE cellulose also is a very stable carrier which can be regenerated although no such commercial process is operational in the case of glucoamylase mainly because of the process economics .	4.224445752177233

Most of the process which are in use they are using adsorption onto clays , bentonite or some other clay ; not any expensive or well defined matrices .	2.810186969764523

So these are some of the illustrated examples not that these are the only processes which are operational ; a large number of other processes which are operational commercially all over the world are one is penicillin acylase .	2.948452379422625

Hydrolysis of Pen G or V goes to six APA and the six APA is an intermediate for variety of antibiotics , the semi synthetic antibiotic and they are commonly used .	2.601389496040528

Many of the immobilized penicillin acylase system have been produced wide vied and marketed .	3.1695521350013043

A large number of products are available commercially .	5.459141504207978

India also is a major producer of six APA and produces significant quantity of six APA but bulk of the immobilized enzyme preparations are imported .	3.31213996729856

The products are available from many countries …… in Sweden , or … .	3.7175219327988813

in UK , … .	27.37809023650783

Some industries which are making more immobilized enzymes here in house they are also importing the carrier .	2.801097005592146

It makes no difference if you go to the carrier bulk of the cost is already paid and and this is another example where immobilized enzymes are used commercially and in very large quantities .	3.9936261114994833

Then you have inversion of sucrose a very typical illustrative example from the point of view of India .	2.9664221496863004

World over the production of a glucose fructose syrup is mediated through corn .	3.4794459617891427

Corn as the starting material ; Corn is hydrolyzed to produce glucose , corn …. .. starch or starch to glucose and glucose isomerisation to fructose and an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose but in India a good quality corn meant for this purpose what we call as sweet corn is usually not available since the relative cost of the corn is also high in India , being the staple food .	2.094380195086899

So it doesn ’ t meet the requisite commercial requirements .	4.0695891572403236

But still to produce glucose fructose syrup for many of the food industry applications and the major consumer of glucose fructose syrup in India is the beverage industry .	2.8334388599735365

In fact most of the products for example the beverages particularly Pepsi and Coke they are based on glucose fructose syrup ; they don ’ t use sucrose as a sweetener because of the use of glucose and fructose syrup in their parent countries their processes need glucose and fructose syrup .	2.8738019187576653

Otherwise the product specification will change and so in India they are using the inversion of sucrose using invertase because sucrose is available at fairly low cost and inversion of sucrose by invertase is the process which is used in India and again in the immobilized form .	2.5591483261843377

There are at least three or four major units which supply glucose fructose syrup produced from sugar .	2.934153317561378

Then another process is for malic acid from fumaric acid .	3.301658751959363

The fumaric acid on hydrolysis by fumerase gives L - maleic acid which finds applications in food industry as a food additive .	2.266861469569927

As a matter of fact the conventional method other than this for maleic acid is only isolation from fruits which has to be very , very expensive compared to this method but fumaric acid is available as synthetic organic acid and fumaric acid can be converted to maleic acids for variety of applications .	2.314640382748393

Then the brewing industry uses for chill proofing of beer .	2.8853070886819805

During the stages of beer after fermentation is over it is clarified and is stored for sometime .	2.449988894319879

During storage it develops a haze and this haze is as a result of reaction between polyphenolics and polypeptides because both these molecules comes from the basic raw materials .	2.7103870847525475

You use barley or any other cereal … .	5.731754387255874

which have initially started to make the mess .	5.540034457219807

They contain certain polyphenolics and polypeptides and they react during storage to give you a haze and hazy beer nobody likes .	2.647402632153037

Then another application in food sector has been on lactose free milk .	3.03718259241819

In India we are used to take milk and sugar is assimilated .	3.420524961491778

But in many countries the population is not able to assimilate lactose and it causes diarrhea and other kind of clinical symptoms and therefore people cannot take milk .	2.158180265958677

In those cases they produce lactose free milk by the action of beta galactosidase on milk which hydrolyses the lactose into galactose and glucose .	2.2162911747249434

Galactose and glucose are assimilable or the monosaccharides which can be assimilated and without loosing any of the nutritive value the milk can be made free from lactose and are available for consumption in some of the countries .	2.752911120960319

Welcome back , and we will start this tenth lecture , and we will continue our discussion on radical chain polymerization .	3.889900688371915

And , in this lecture , this tenth lecture , I will try to complete the discussion on the different type of radical initiator , which we began in the last lecture , and briefly talk about the initiator efficiency .	3.7067396932821315

And then go into the mechanism and kinetics of radical polymerization , which will include the dependence of polymerization rate on initial , initiator concentration as well as monomer concentration .	3.593852302161595

And we will talk about kinetic chain length and molecular weight of the polymer produced in chain polymerization , in this case radical chain polymerization , and we will try , if time permits , we can or we will start the chain transfer .	4.53219295271282

And we talked about ; we are actually talking about different types of initiators , which can be used , or which are typically used in radical chain polymerization .	3.693857522440921

And , we talked about different types of initiator , which can be used or which can be utilized ; for example , we talked about thermal initiator , where by applying heat we can dissociate homiletically a set of molecules or different types of molecules , for example , AIBN and benzyl peroxide , which we can use for radical chain polymerization as initiator .	3.5770458758398775

We were talking about other methods of chain initiation radical generation , and we started a discussion on redox initiator .	2.9925139138950962

And , in the redox is basically reducing agent and the oxidizing agents , and I gave example of peroxides and a reducing agents like iron .	2.258638857976758

And , we also talked about the peroxides and amine .	4.9424116723412395

And then , we start today with more options of redox initiator .	3.2647316451175237

So , let us continue this redox initiator discussion .	4.101955102055314

We can take , we talked about this example of benzyl peroxide and diethyl amine in the last class .	3.8397555267685886

And , we also showed the values of k d and we found that , no , we seen that k d is much higher for this redox reactions ; which means , redox reaction can be conducted redox ; they have radical polymerization where radical is generated by a redox reaction can be done at lower temperature including temperature compared to the thermal initiator .	3.077378024325871

The third type initiator redox initiation could be inorganic reductants plus inorganic oxidants , which give rise to .	2.530197944272325

The other examples could be per sulfate plus diamine , a very common or very popular use of this combination is typically used for making polyacrylamide gels , which is a combination of ammonium per sulfate APS and TEMED .	2.7612007713683973

You know , this reaction is very common and done in bio chemical laboratory for making polyacrylamide gel for polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses ; TEMED is N , N , N dash , N dash , especially diamine tetra methyl ethylene diamine .	2.417571040979275

So , the combination of per sulfate plus diamine gives the radical .	3.821458291341323

Now , we , we talked about thermal initiator .	6.897257619165479

We now learned about the redox initiator .	4.52538423813182

The other examples or other types , where you can utilize is , a photo chemical initiator , photo chemical initiator or photo initiator , in short .	3.1384018278345187

For example , here you can use aromatic Tetons .	6.341091645641409

In this case , on photo , these molecules can absorb photon and go to a higher excited state , which can actually dissociated , dissociate to form a couple of radical .	2.7726829914553157

So , here , what we are showing here that , here at aromatic teton , which on photo radiation it absorb photons and go to a higher excited state which by itself it can break or dissociate homiletically forming radicals .	2.3613171372280193

Or , it can actually photo sensitize the another compound , and go to a , make a complex in excited state , which further can dissociate producing radicals ; for example , if you have it react with a molecular this , form this is the composes , and this can initiate a chain polymerization .	3.147101627662912

Simply this AIBN type molecule also can absorb photon and break into 2 radicals .	2.781549027336092

Most commercially used radical initiators are like benzoins .	4.00993860575412

For example , I have molecule like this , or you can have benzyl ketals , benzyl ketals where you have structure of that like this .	3.7881649557192976

These are the main type of photo initiator or photo chemical initiator used in commercial applications .	3.0550768011026634

Now , the advantage of this photochemical reactions or photo chemical initiator is that you can do your polymerization reactions locally .	3.939068834628448

If you have a , if you , if you have a reaction mixture , and if you can partition or you can cover some part with a opaque , opaque material , then the part which is exposed to the photons or light , that part will get polymerization .	3.203587952073105

So , it is , it is very , very useful to application , like film , where you can cover a part of the film , and you can keep part of the film uncovered ; where if you sign light , that part will get polymerized , leaving the part where , which is covered as unpolymerized medium .	3.1505630725935103

So , if this photo polymerization method or the radical polymerization by photo initiators sometimes can be used , has a advantage ; this can be used or it is used to apply or used to make polymers in a local or in a , whatever targeted part .	3.3010569888128414

The other type of initiator is like a high by , initiation by high energy , energy radiation , like gamma ray or x ray .	2.8945460459509027

Now , these are very high energy .	8.834494880031244

So , it , when it reacts with , say , some organic molecule , it can form radical cat ion and eject a electron ; and this radical cat ion can dissociate into radical and a cat ion , which can capture this electron and form another radical .	2.353365918756166

There may be another possibility , where on this high energy radiation , is can capture a electron and form a radical anion ; and these radical anion can dissociate into a radical anion , and which again gives away electron to form a radical .	2.752733931448837

So , using very high energy radiation sources , we can apply or we can generate a radical , which can initiate the radical polymerization reaction .	3.9276055512359846

The other type of possible initiation is the thermally induced self initiation ; that means , the monomer itself , on thermal or on heating can gives rise to , or they can generate radical , but this not a very common way of generating radical ; this is , has been proved only for , in the case of styrene .	2.8264455599246254

And , this is the mechanism which is proposed for thermally induced self initiation of styrene , where styrene molecules , 2 styrene molecules by this capering first get dynamised ; and then , this dynamised styrene molecule can react with a third styrene which extract a hydrogen atom forming two radicals , which can individually initiate the chain polymers .	2.4992576028903413

This is the proposed mechanism for styrene and it is initiated in troop .	3.8165035992227985

But , this is , this thermal induced self initiation is not a very common and solution for styrene ; so , this is very specific case for styrene .	4.156430206641349

The other types of , there are few other special type , or very , a small applications of other types of radical generation , or other type initiator ; for example , there are electro chemical initiator , if you have a salt of carboxylic acids , and present in electro chemical cell , then in this carboxylic acids all can get ionized , oxidized to form a radical .	2.521115879174082

So , for example , if I write this ; it can give up electron in a anion den can produce radical in a electorate .	3.2657640693572345

If you have a , if you want to do electro chemical polymerization or electro chemical radical polymerization , you can , you use this technique to start the polymerization .	3.6333838463192114

So , by this time , we now know the different types of , different types of initiation possibilities ; that means , different types of molecules which can be used as initiator to generate radical in the reaction medium and not only the molecule , but the ways they can produce radical ; for example , by thermal , by photo , or by electro chemical , we just talked about , or the radical can be generated by a very high energy radiations like gamma ray or x ray .	2.9373297798899647

Now , if you talk about , if the , all the radicals which are produced , do they , do they all react , or do they initiate a polymerization ?	3.0737850534019384

Not always .	26.763505507810176

And , or the fraction of the radicals which are produced by homiletic cleavage or the redox reaction of the initiator molecules ; they are not 100 percent of those starts a chain polymerization , or the initiate chain polymerization , in part of which are get lost .	3.399942476955369

And , the fraction of which , of the radicals generated during this initiation processes which start the initiation reaction is termed as initiator efficiency .	3.4892247672900725

And , is typically the initiator efficiencies , initiator efficiencies lie around say 0.3 to 0.8 , which means that the , among all the radical species which are generated around 30 percent to 80 percent of the radicals , actually generate or initiate a chain polymers .	2.7502767918714675

What about , what happens is , rest of the radicals which do not generate or initiate chain polymers ?	3.9834147474266546

They get destroyed to form dead molecules .	4.49736802736858

For example , if you take AIBN , you have seen that AIBN on dissociating to this , this species ; now , they can again recombine by reacting with themselves and form these molecule .	2.6708214503961965

In this case , part of the radicals which were generated by homiletic cleavage of AIBN , they are getting destroyed ; in the sense , they are becoming inefficient , inefficient or dead , non radical species by reacting with themselves .	2.8962182869306834

So , part of which are lost .	6.122589185524414

In propagating chain , which are expressed as , M n dot , can also react with these , a radical primary radical , and form a dead molecule .	3.0566797318549677

So , by these are , these are the few ways , where the radicals which got generated by the initiator molecules , they get destroyed and form non reactive molecules .	3.4581616994139415

Other examples , like we will take a benzyl peroxide example .	4.540522229739184

And , we will talk about induced decomposition of initiator ; or , if I have a propagating radical ; now , if give example of benzyl peroxide , it can , the propagating radical can react with initiator molecules and form a another radical .	3.1935915453248245

Now , these molecules , in normal case , where supposed to generate 2 radicals , but in this case on reacting with a chain , propagating chain , it is only producing 1 radicals .	3.092769709124458

So , the efficiency of the radical initiator is decreased .	5.6545439646639855

And , not only that , they can undergo , these radicals which are produced initially they can undergo reaction and get destroyed , or get formed into non radical species .	2.999581296537584

For example , again take the example , we can take the example of benzyl peroxide ; it get dissociated to case ; now , 2 of these can react and form C O 2 ; this can react with monomer , and there are several side reaction possible with these ; and , by this sort of side reaction ; these all can undergo phi dot plus C O 2 .	2.753967007283072

Now , this can further undergo several side reactions .	3.7240379786499562

So , if there were no side reaction , the amount of radicals it was generating ; now , it has reduced because this so many side reaction .	2.6849367608789416

Or , in other words , all the radicals which are getting generated by homiletic cleavage of this benzyl peroxide , they are not participating , or they are not initiating a chain ; which means , that is the , they are getting lost in doing non polymerization reaction .	3.399725042652622

So , that is the reason that not 100 percent initiator is efficient ; and part of it , which , like 30 to 80 percent of radicals generated initially ; they actually initiate a polymerization reaction .	2.605554766058647

So , we have talked about different initiator , and different way of , different types of initiator , and the how the efficiency of initiator ?	3.8715763842704605

Now , let us talk about kinetics of radical polymerization .	4.051164378729222

As we know , the first step is initiation .	8.158283155474374

This primary radical react with a monomer R M dot .	4.897146544060715

We are just , for short , we are writing M 1 dot here .	4.018877511242853

This is chain initiating radical or species .	4.8276876749222986

So , these are , the initiation step is actually consist of 2 short steps - 1 and 2 .	3.407594441443043

And , then , these chain initiating radical react with another monomer , M 1 dot plus M , M 2 dot ; this again react with forming M 3 dot .	3.1929247846850446

M 2 dot is R M M dot , this is R M M M dot , and so on .	4.305926077811071

This you can write many steps , and in general , I can write dot .	5.2593903184642485

So , we had initiation in earlier page .	4.485035463847236

Now , we know propagation , and this can undergo termination ; third step , we will talk to that in a minute .	4.12898420305281

Now , rate of polymerization , R p , is given by rate of consumption of monomers .	5.164927290387667

Now , it is assuming that the monomers which are getting consumed , they are reacting and forming polymerization , they are becoming part of polymerization .	3.3928372433463245

Now , what are the step , what are the stages or what are the reactions the monomer is getting consumed ?	4.741647066131359

We talked about , in the initiation reaction ; here , the monomer is getting consumed .	4.932839934377655

So , I write , initiator rate there , and plus , all these steps .	3.393136350167248

So , if I write these steps R p 1 , R p 2 , R p n , and so on .	2.903057586263234

So , R p 1 plus , R p 2 plus , R p 3 plus , R p n plus , so on .	3.0800677483968872

Now , because this is very small , very small amount of monomer get consumed in the initiation reaction , we can ignore this ; and we can write R p as a sum of all these propagating steps .	4.382055867660306

Now , if I write rate constant for these individual step as k p 1 , k p 2 , k p n , then what is the individual step ?	3.9414909968158796

Now , it is very difficult .	9.028394890248983

So , what is assumed ?	7.948639261769674

That , all these rate constant for all these propagating reactions , they are same .	4.904291734644034

It is similar to the assumption we made for step growth polymerization , the assumption of equal reactivity of the functional group .	3.8772955077446105

Similarly , in this case , the reactivity of this radical does not depend ; we are assuming that it does not depend on the size of the molecules .	5.208586582394873

So , there is a M 1 , M 2 , or , because the system is large , and we know that it has been experimentary proof also that , the rates , rate constants become very , or becomes same as long as , as soon as they become this chain contain 2 to 3 monomers ; as long as these chains are 2 to 3 monomers , the rates , all the rates become , all the rate constants become equal .	2.878277762393167

So , that is the assumption we are making that , all these rate constants are equal ; and , so , we can write all the rate constant as k p , and M is there , and everywhere .	4.077006389789299

So , these all are same ; k p 1 , k p 2 , k p n , these are all same .	3.8074140126848732

So , I can take it out .	5.738377195569039

And , then , M is present in everywhere .	6.511414819768796

So , M is also taken out .	5.412015126048395

And , a summation of all the other terms , M 1 dot , M 2 dot , M 3 dot , M n dot .	4.055144467793187

So , this is i , i dot .	5.304668004498398

So , these term , I can simply write k p M and M dot ; I am just writing the M dot .	4.057850286849769

So , M dot is ; this is the summation of the concentration of all the radicals present ; all the propagating radicals present in the reaction medium .	4.882137566421952

So , these ; so , R p now given up , given by k p rate constant for all those individual steps , monomer concentration , and this is the summation of the concentration of all the propagating radicals of the , all the chain radicals ; this is the sum of all those things .	3.6198929715678725

Now , experimentally , or ; this is the unknown quantity .	7.491031148343278

We cannot , this is very difficult to measure this , this quantity experimentally .	4.824363425802556

So , how do you get this rate of polymerization ?	6.156601682791624

We assume a steady state , where ; now , immediately after the reaction starts , the change in radical , total radical concentration becomes 0 with time ; which means that , the radicals are consumed at the same rate , as they are getting produced .	3.4217670698895555

Now , radical get produced in the initiation reaction and they get destroyed in the termination reaction , which we just going to talk in a minute .	3.843847055546075

So , as soon as the reaction start , within a very short period of time , the rate of initiation becomes same as rate of termination ; as a result , the concentration of these total radical species , rate radical propagating radical become constant at during the entire polymerization reaction ; and that is not very unusual , because we , when we do the kinetics of the first reactions with having intermediates , then we always assume steady state , and we do the kinetics in that way .	3.2791316226355463

So , in a steady state , the rate of initiation is equals to rate of termination .	6.0764030663239375

Now , what is the rate of termination ?	7.2894274239247805

We talk about termination step now .	5.677024759000703

How this radical , M n dot , they can get terminated ?	4.327229807782569

If I talk about the , that same structure , take out that same simple monomer ; now , how this can get terminated ?	3.539642466680964

They can get terminated reacting with the same molecule , and by coupling reaction they can .	4.108722372319808

So , that is k termination by coupling ; this is a coupling process .	5.238797241679707

So , if I write this as M n dot , this is a M m dot , then this will be M n plus m .	4.587226047917638

Now , they can get terminated by other type of reaction , disproportionate reaction as well .	4.0865959394935

Disproportionation , 2 of these .	14.220137047360364

For example , if I talk about methyl methacrylate , like this is the form to difference this .	4.120674116569269

So , if I write M n dot here , and this is M m dot , and this reaction is k termination by disproportionation , then it gives again M n plus M m .	3.863879820981135

So , here , the molecular weight , on termination the molecular weight does not change , ignoring the difference of 2 hydrogen here , between this two .	4.1598968726939844

So , in this case , the molecular weight remain unchanged ; it becomes the dead polymers , as same as the size of the reacting polymer .	3.779388151322515

Where , in the earlier case , it is , the length of the final terminated chain is the summation of the size of the 2 reacting species .	4.993954649907028

Now , in general , we can write M n dot plus M m dot gives write k t is the dead polymer .	4.22363172685563

So , if I write this , then it , in general , it takes care of both the coupling reaction and the initiation .	3.545156572448836

In both cases , these 2 radical , propagating radical reacting and forming dead polymer .	3.500704469181516

So , what is the rate of this termination step ?	6.863263802312618

Is given by k t M dot square , because it is a bi molecular reaction .	4.5376517740922475

So , now , this is again , the M dot is the summation of concentration of the , all the propagating radical .	5.478172936119349

So , now , I write this rate of termination is now got there it is a bi molecular reaction .	4.336840033492266

So , k t multiplied by M dot square .	4.536837127428518

So , from that we can find the M dot as R i by k t , to the power half .	3.7774756847396014

Now , in some cases , in some text , they follow that R t is , rate of termination is twice k t M dot square .	3.190690975171638

Now , this term twice is introduced ; in some text , this twice is introduced , because that the 1 termination reaction is effective in bringing the termination of 2 radical .	2.5030044791399373

So , this 2 terms we introduced .	7.141230195232337

Now , if is , it is up to you , whether you want to write 2 , or if you do not want to write 2 ; but , if you write 2 here , then similarly when in initiation reaction a homiletic cleavage gives up 2 radicals , you have to write 2 as well .	3.2567440803157996

So , that gives , 2 cancels out .	5.472470872188236

And , if you choose not to write 2 , then during the initiation reaction also you have to choose not to write 2 in the ; it will come back that initiation reaction , rate of initiation , again when you write the expression for R i , rate of initiation .	3.3850810780513725

So , R p , rate of polymerization , polymerization , we have deduced earlier , M n dot , which will now become M R I by k t ; now , let us write 2 here ; let us follow this convention .	2.913679541805712

So , I write 2 , and this is what the rate of polymerization is .	8.798797112279551

So , we have to know R i .	7.0034087546115575

Now , R i is , this is for thermal initiation .	8.47168593813843

So , how do I write the R i ?	5.508443733367372

We write , this is k d I .	10.143293394450863

Now , again , because this is produced and we are following that , we should write 2 here , during the termination rate .	4.3094795912455695

So , here also we write 2 .	6.916123066806343

And , also , with our knowledge , that all the radicals which are generated by the homiletic cleavage of the initiator molecule , they do not react or they do not initiate the chain polymerization ; the fraction of the radicals which generated here , some of them actually initiate the radical polymerization ; and so , we multiplied term f , which is here the efficiency .	3.45723252076884

So , this would give the total expression for the rate of initiation ; rate constant of the dissociation , initiate the concentration , this is the efficiency of initiator , and 2 we are writing because we are following the same conventions 2 here , and the logic is that because 1 initiator molecule is giving up 2 radicals which are initiating 2 chains , we are writing 2 here .	3.3669834616156593

Now , if we go back and look at this or compare this initiation reaction which we wrote earlier , and you can argue that we are not , we are not talking about , or we are taking , not taking this reaction in the consideration , when we are determining R i .	3.608648040267126

Now , they are fact that this is the very first reaction .	6.374539929783095

These , as well as the all the propagating reactions , they are very fast compared to the initial dissociation reaction of the initiator molecule into 2 react , 2 radicals .	4.766917111315411

So , when we are considering rate of initiation , we are only taking or only considering , considering this k d , not the k i .	3.2482551023816706

So , that , this is clear that , inspite of they having 2 step in the initiation process , we are taking the slower step which is basically the rate determining step for the initiation process .	3.5615376330175375

So , finally , let us talk about the final expression for rate of polymerization .	5.125111296189417

This rate of polymerization R p .	9.141379597581388

Now , this is for thermal initiator ; it is given by , R p is given by k t , k p , M , R i ; R i is twice f k d I , twice k t to the power half .	3.482680634548267

This 2 cancels out .	11.57767509304157

So , k p , M , f k d , I , k t , to the power half .	3.304113107275736

Now , this is for thermal initiator .	7.278337872795029

What is , it would look like , for a redox initiator ?	4.098297501236042

A redox initiator is , rate of initiator is , k d , concentration of reductant oxidant .	3.9794741742650843

So , for this type of initiation , we can write R p is M , fie I a by k t , to the power half .	3.8416423097232313

So , we talked about a different , the most common rate expression for rate of polymerization ; whether it is , it has initiated by thermal initiator or redox initiator or by photo chemical initiation , these are the most common root of initiating a radical polymerization .	3.516864969296071

So , we know the rate expressions for the rate of polymerization .	5.167165891663898

Now , let us go back and look at this thermal initiator , which is the most common ; R p is given by this , which means rate of polymerization is directly proportional to the concentration of monomer ; and , it is actually directly proportional to the square root of the concentration of initiator .	4.133132951981025

So , R p is proportional to the concentration of the monomer , and it is proportional initiator concentration .	5.898137435633051

So , if you increase the concentration during a radical polymerization , then you know the rate will increase , but of course at the proportional to the square root of the initiator concentration ; and , if you increase the monomer concentration , then rate will be a increasing , rate of polymerization would be increasing in , as a direct , directly proportion .	3.620322334128666

So , if you plot ; and , this has been shown experimentally ; if I have this plot R p , rate of polymerization with I to the power half square root of I , it gives a straight line , so as this .	3.390889260685047

Now , sometimes , experimentally it is found , then it is not a directly proportional to the power for initiator ; it could be more than 1 .	5.047111367450347

So , like 3 by 2 , some cases , experimentally it might , you might find out or some cases it might be even lower .	2.9383604300291597

Now , that indicates that , now that indicates that ; see if we , if the rate of polymerization dependent not directly , not to the power 1 , but more than 1 select 3 by 1.5 ; which means , that this monomer also taking part in generating radicals .	3.270222305271796

So , that might have in few cases , where the monomer can take part in homiletic cleavage and generate radical , or it can react with some other molecule , initiator molecules and produce the radical .	3.4554427515619097

So , it the monomer itself take part in the initiation reaction , then there is another terms comes .	4.908971127014097

So , you get a half here , a additional half .	4.110408037576804

So , this becomes 1.5 .	12.782981908884162

Similarly , if you see that this is not following , this actually following even less than that ; which means , that some of the initiator react initiator which are produced , they are actually ; even you know they form the radicals which are produced by , and form the initiator molecules , they are not taking part .	3.5773627015208285

So , the efficiency actually comes down , came down during the reaction .	3.375813516079894

So , which also means that as the reaction progress , both the concentration of monomer and the initiator comes down ; which means , as the reaction progress with time , the rate of polymerization also comes down .	3.9019303189830006

But there is , there is the special case at the end of the reaction , if the monomer concentrating I , which we will talk about in the later lecture .	4.179303327253395

So , again to form , again write the ; now if you go back to this expression , besides this term , this is called as concentration term monomers ; and , the concentration of monomer and concentration of initiator , these are also determine your rate of polymerization .	3.598759946031183

So , and which will depend upon the temperature .	7.602171197943619

If we increase the temperature , then depending how it is effecting the values of k d I , k t and R p , the rate will vary .	3.421088946131587

Now , we will come in the later lecture , what is the effect of temperature on a rate of polymerization ?	4.385202335725141

Now , let us talk about a molecular weight in radical chain polymerization .	4.460916030068137

Now , before we molecule , we come to the discussion of molecular weight , we will define a term kinetic chain length , nu , which is average number of monomers polymerized per each radical , which initiate a polymer chain .	3.238361176189601

So , it is a average number of monomers which polymerize per radical ; per radical , which actually polymerize , which actually initiate the polymerization ; not the , as we said that some of the radicals get , you know , consumed by side reactions , or some other reactions , we do not initiate polymer chain .	3.1502108476078807

And , this is the average number of monomers polymerized per radicals which initiate a polymer chain .	3.7873296637689178

It is rate of polymerization , divided by rate of termination , or as steady state assumption , it is same as the radius of a rate of initiation .	4.267723881957725

So , we can write nu as k p M ; from your the last expressions , which we decided in the last few pages , we can write these as same .	3.1934611747523327

And , if we consider only the case of thermal initiator , then nu is equal to R p by R I , k p M .	4.6928678492714315

So , nu is the average number of monomers which is getting polymerized per radicals .	4.671227318888244

You should consider the radicals which are only , the only those radicals which are initiating a polymer chain .	3.7254508899346352

So , what would be the average molecular ?	6.706875610605929

What will be the relation between the degrees or average degrees of polymerization with nu ?	4.584188782844189

Average degrees of polymerization and this nu , if the polymerization is done by coupling , coupling , then M n would be , X n bar would be , the average degrees of polymerization would be twice nu ; nu is the average number of monomers consumed in this chain .	3.5427409641160588

So , the degrees of polymerization will be summation of this , plus this .	4.212585708382744

And , we are talking about average .	8.67963656032784

So , it is 2 nu .	7.826674692796788

If it is gets terminated by the disproportionation reactions , we seen earlier ; then average degrees of polymerization is nu , because the number of monomers , average numbers of monomers per radical is the size of this chain .	3.252240078779437

And , we know that X n is M w , M n bar is M 0 X n bar .	5.145425387339593

So , which means , if the kinetic chain length ; there are kinetic chain length which basically , a number of radicals , number of monomers which consumed per radicals .	3.7894451469989456

So , you have a radical propagating chain and another propagating chain .	4.7450825576815525

If they are in , terminated by a coupling reaction , then you have twice nu is the molecular weight , average molecular , average degrees of polymerization ; whereas , if they are terminated by disproportion reactions , then the average degrees of polymerization would be equals to the kinetic chain length nu .	3.5416179348220025

And , how do you determine , what are the number of molecules ?	7.869996568553025

If they are terminated by coupling reaction , then every dead chain would have two species from the initiator molecule , the fragments , residual fragment form initiator molecule .	2.503662821084576

And if they are terminated by disproportionation , then they will have 1 residue from the initiator molecules .	4.211061967183236

Now , what we will do in the next lecture ?	3.1853179407673133

We will continue from these , and talk about termination reactions or transfer reactions .	3.6833658496600057

You may recall that earlier we have outlined various ways of the mechanisms by which enzymes catalyze chemical reactions .	2.6700517490760287

One of the unique features of the enzymesí catalytic function is their specificity .	4.1170197603715994

In fact when we distinguish them or when we compare them with a variety of chemically catalyzed reactions or even uncatalyzed reactions they are distinguished by virtue of their specificity .	2.541515471354463

In the case of chemical catalyst a single catalyst may catalyze a large variety of similar reactions .	2.9619583286641324

If you consider nickel as the catalyst all the hydrogenation reactions can be catalyzed by that .	3.115706357381761

Similarly in the case with colloidal platinum or vanadium pentoxide or even acids acts as a catalyst .	3.2928202281580674

For large variety of hydrolytic reactions acids or hydrogen ions can act as a catalytic function .	3.64037033914081

On the other hand when we talk about enzymes these functions are highly specific .	3.612048026803798

In most cases the enzymatic catalytic function is both substrates specific as well as product specific .	3.6373308838826452

That means you need different enzymes to act on different substrates or to produce a particular product different enzymes are needed .	2.8421062779243567

There is a significant variety as for as specificity is concerned .	3.692328731192528

All the enzymes are not specific to the same extent .	5.701954771255906

In many cases the enzymes may exhibit a very broad specificity not too strictly specific .	3.1267651574015027

A large number of examples which you may be familiar with are what we call as group specific enzymes .	3.4324006822322444

A characteristic example of these kinds of enzymes is hexokinase .	3.9887945491757595

Hexokinase phosphorylate hexose to a hexose phosphate through involvement of ATP , a very characteristic enzyme .	2.615650150649531

This enzyme particularly will be able to act upon a large variety of hexose as a substrate and it can phosphorylate .	4.0303163652649

It is not very strictly specific in that sense and we call it as group specific .	4.223600496059022

Similarly in the case of alcohol , an alcohol dehydrogenase which also involves NAD gives the corresponding aldehyde .	3.2251265142907917

Another example of a group specific enzyme , whereby the variety of alcohols particularly primary alcohols are oxidized to their corresponding aldehyde involve NAD , NADH system as a cofactor .	2.5576236664277183

There are certain enzymes which are highly specific and exhibit absolute specificity .	3.9269077395481564

If you consider the same class of hexokinase a very closely related enzyme is what we call as gluco - kinase .	3.069392687024021

This accepts only glucose as a substrate and phosphorylate to gluco - 6 - phosphate .	3.206299463461863

No other excess sugar is acted upon by such an enzyme .	3.381302908643816

They show absolute specificity .	8.003629405063712

The most absolute specificity in terms of an enzyme , with which some of you may be familiar , is oxidation of ﬂ - D - glucose to glucono lactone by glucose oxidase a fungal enzyme which is produced by Aspergillus niger .	2.7918755115714258

This acts on not only on D - glucose , but it accepts only ﬂ - D - glucose and a - D - glucose is just not accepted .	2.591777720283289

If you consider a - D - glucose the particular enzyme doesnít act or for that matter even if you go to another isomer of glucose say galactose it doesnít act on even galactose , which is not very different , excepting that these hydroxyl and hydrogen atoms are inter changed .	2.5689928927493018

These are the types of the enzymes which fall in the category of absolute specificity .	3.883746111281975

Then we have a number of enzymes which show stereo chemical specificity .	5.267073592167569

That means they recognize the arrangement of atoms at a carbon atom at which stereo isomerism can occur .	2.512150818182805

There are large varieties of enzymes .	5.082746824818341

If you consider the example of let us say lipase .	6.1382913422381895

Lipase from various sources can exhibit specificity , only one of the isomer either l or d isomer .	3.1100826066729392

There are a large number of such examples in the chemical literature or the bio chemical literature .	3.660896979764774

The only enzyme which is known to act on both the stereoisomers or the enzymes whose function is to interconvert L and D isomers are usually called as racemases .	2.649351260727429

For example L - alanine to D - alanine .	3.915013228173814

This is the only one classical example where an enzyme can act on both stereoisomers .	3.4942103132886384

Otherwise most of the enzyme will exhibit stereochemical specificity and if there is an asymmetric carbon atom it will only accept one of the isomers and not the other .	3.975579756823339

The stereochemical specificity can extend to the level that enzyme acting on a non assymetric molecule can produce one of the isomers as a product .	2.9184434321427277

The typical example is glycerol kinase .	5.378369608171366

Glycerol as we know is CH2OH - CHOH - CH2OH .	4.899479938650558

It is a non - assymetric product .	6.456484980802959

The carbon atom in both the ñCH2OH are identical .	4.528938506077713

But the enzyme acts on glycerol molecule and produces L - glycerol - 3 - phosphate .	3.0470619774592893

That means the enzyme transfers again the action of ATP to ADP .	3.431351501763114

The enzyme transfers phosporyl group to the third carbon atom of the glycerol molecule .	3.1437619234461294

Although the one and three are identical still it is able to exhibit the stereochemical specificity in terms of product formation .	3.641019706106933

What we must appreciate is that the variety of specificity that can occur in the case of enzymatic reaction can be very loosely specific in terms of group specific enzymes , absolute specificity with respect to a single substrate ; it can be stereochemically specific with respect to substrate or with respect to product .	3.6266540148368396

Therefore in summary the enzyme will exhibit specificity both with respect to substrate as well as with respect to product .	4.024546677040423

As I explained earlier the glycerol molecule is a symmetric molecule .	3.3821106512240378

There is no asymmetry in this .	4.996715166544262

But the enzyme glycerol kinase acts only on the third carbon .	3.857693873819363

You can analyze the product and see where the phosporyl group has gone .	3.538224227341753

Consider the structural conformation of glycerol .	5.225241263191127

This is one , two and three and this acts only on the third one which is on the left hand side .	3.56778122627077

We are expressing here our conformation on a planar diagram .	3.1414683511782293

When you look at a three dimensional space , in a three dimensional space the one and three will not be in the same plane .	4.22468729879171

The specificity can have a very large variety and one must also appreciate that the specificity of these enzymes in terms of their catalytic action is attributed to the active sites .	3.97659926730498

As we also saw in the last lecture where the catalytic function was studied , the catalytic functions of the enzymes are responsible for the role played by active site .	3.4680091114237204

The specificity also is the result of the conformation of active site .	4.761746087272109

The active sites must be considered as consisting of two different parts : the binding sites and the functional sites .	3.906573577791697

Another factor of stereospecificity is that prediction of stereospecificity by any ground rule is difficult .	2.548711990217316

We are able to know the specificity only while we determine the amount of product formed on a particular substrate .	4.286419014729612

In the case of a chemical reaction to take place you have ?	4.367797445096853

G value , the free energy change of the reaction , which will give you an idea whether the reaction will take place in the forward direction or reverse direction or there will be an equilibrium established .	4.277980107775745

But in the case of specificity of enzyme action the only way to understand the specificity is that we monitor the product formed on the substrate and then we can say yes this is specific to the substrates .	3.8766216369276405

Once we find the specificity then we can propose hypothesis or mechanisms by which the stereo specificity can be explained .	3.5633637836240246

But there are no other thermodynamic or kinetic interpretations which can be applied to the specificity .	4.285576992977052

That is another feature .	7.997584406314974

One of the most interesting features of enzyme specificity is their stereochemical specificity because when there is a single molecule the functional groups are different , active sites also may have different functional groups to bind them and the steps can be understood .	2.8979592449771316

But to understand the stereochemical specificity that how enzyme is able to identify the two different stereoisomers , the minimum requirements on the function of an active sites was proposed by Oxten as early as 1948 .	2.810352392208291

He proposed that at least there must be three sites of different points of interaction on an enzyme active site .	3.058382333175828

Here the bottom one is the whole enzyme molecule and the dotted line represents the active sites .	4.078489785738495

I must again remind you that this is not a planar site .	5.2382233642251945

It is a three dimensional structure on the surface of the enzyme molecule and not that all the amino acids on these active sites are located in proximity in the amino acid chain .	3.949491848953854

They are brought in proximity by folding of the enzyme protein .	4.284602940576879

At least it is understood that as proposed by Oxten that the enzyme active site also must have at least three different functional residues on the active site which can interact with the substrate molecule .	3.314647820848803

These three interacting sites let us consider that they are the interaction sites .	5.114599517824701

Minimum two of them must be binding sites , out of the three at least two on which the substrate molecule can bind to the active site and put the substrate in a very fixed orientation .	4.520813924728556

We have two points .	8.56792333288512

We are holding the enzyme molecule bound to the substrate .	5.559597392515843

This binding has to be oriented in such a way that the third functional group on the substrate which has to undergo reaction is brought in vicinity of the catalytic site .	3.7207487394845664

That is one minimum requirement for explaining the specificity of enzyme action that there must be minimum three sites which interact between the enzyme and substrate .	2.7033936568608086

Two of them must be at least binding sites and the substrate binds on these two sites to the enzyme molecule whereby it orients the substrate molecule along with the enzyme such that the reactive functional group and the reactive site on enzymes active site come in proximity or in vicinity .	3.2567612510283785

Of course the various mechanisms that we discussed it could be a strain on the bond , it could be the entropic factors and it could be various covalent interactions or electro static interactions that might play a role to carry out the catalysis .	3.3891517793658794

But as far as the binding is concerned , it has to be specific in terms of bringing the functional group on which the reaction has to take place .	4.977336910631696

I will try to explain the same points with a particular example of oxidation of a D - amino acid , using D - amino acid oxidase where you have this amino group which undergoes reaction .	3.306787068627799

In the molecule the carboxylic group and the methyl group are bound onto the enzyme active site .	3.7832455880874196

The one which binds methyl group will be hydrophobic in nature and this will be bound predominantly by electrostatic interactions .	3.483394872777029

These two binding brings the catalytic sites in close vicinity of the amino group which is available for reaction and the catalytic reaction can take place .	4.079410826113901

This is your D - amino acid .	5.694765705606286

You consider corresponding L - amino acid on which the location of H and amino group will be different .	3.8294617609858848

Even if the binding takes place this amino group cannot come in the vicinity of the catalytic site , cannot approach the catalytic site and no reaction can occur .	2.975881315193784

That is why the concept of three interacting sites fairly explains the position of enzymes catalytic action as far as their specificity with respect to stereo isomers is concerned .	2.726648595133858

The situation in the case of different substrates which can have different functional groups can be much simpler .	4.274414124085321

Because the binding site will bind two of the functional group , the third functional group which has to undergo reaction will be only recognized by the catalytic site and no other functional group will be recognized and so reaction cannot take place .	3.394209549864911

One of the very early understanding that as early as 1890 , Oxten proposed such a mechanism which puts a limit just like in the case of rate of a reaction we have a thermo dynamic limit .	3.2253972315520394

If there is a reversible reaction , these are the kind of limits like equilibrium constant will be achieved at this point and so on .	4.184254298689014

Similarly Oxten proposed a limit that minimum there must be three points of interaction .	3.1420749521976914

In case of very hard core specific enzymes the point of interaction can be more than three also .	3.312172032714347

Instead to two binding sites there can be three binding sites also .	3.62508299228373

That depends on the requirement for the enzyme .	7.9835366998512445

As early as in 1890 , Fischer proposed Lock and key hypothesis which explained the enzyme specificity .	2.7304472234584014

This explanation of the specificity was purely based on certain observations and analysis of the situation mostly mental and not analytical because not many analytical facilities were available .	2.4937045131829407

It was suggested that the enzyme active site and the substrate have a conformation which is analogous to lock and the key .	3.7694903147235617

That means the Ö. .. on the key are exactly fitting to the site at which it has to interact with the lock .	3.4304828795055053

They are exactly fitting .	8.42166589764506

This is the active site which is analogues to the lock .	5.399183195102249

The binding sites on the substrate come in proximity or bind to the binding site on the active site of the enzyme molecule .	4.20775636124135

Similarly the reactive group on the substrate comes in contact with two catalytic sites and then once the reacting groups gets entangled with the reaction sites on the active sites , the binding is complete and it can exhibit the catalytic function to take place .	3.391994078890341

Now that was the understanding and they also very clearly understood at that time that both substrate as well as the active site on the enzyme molecule have rigid structures .	3.2815613926274465

There is no question of change if they are rigid in nature .	4.2280599390887

They are just like a lock and key ; there is no flexibility .	5.173730920962188

If there is slight modification either in the conformation of the key it will not fit to the lock and thereby the reaction will not occur .	3.5542543337836965

In fact the Fischerís lock and key arrangement was not based on any of the analytical probes .	3.2684274468613848

It was only a conceptual explanation given because at that time , one thing we must appreciate that , not a very large number of enzyme reactions were understood .	3.436480121970951

Even the stereospecificity was not clearly understood .	4.325794671476197

It was mostly some very common reactions like hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose , most of the hydrolytic reactions were understood and this mechanism proposed only such a macro understanding that the substrate and the enzyme have rigid conformations which are complementary to each other and which fit in strictly .	2.614193565410799

At the time of Fischerís Lock and key mechanism , the most understood enzymatic reaction was hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase to glucose and fructose and obviously they would look into variety of other sugars like lactose on which the enzyme could not act .	2.413185507101395

They could distinguish between the conformations of the substrate molecule and have much detailed information .	3.721191530953038

But still the surprising thing is that the concept is not totally invalid today .	3.866073687099225

In many cases it can still explain the whole theory or whole requirements of specificity .	2.8064261351635555

Then came number of other developments and particularly the development with respect to the availability of analytical data on enzyme substrate binding .	3.27884827568458

People were able to make enzyme substrate complexes and their analogs , analyze them by NMR or EPR or variety of analytical physical tools and they found that when the enzyme and substrate do bind there is a significant change in the conformation .	2.8729890985445143

The conformation is neither the same what was available in the case of enzyme molecule .	4.741980629818199

So there is something going on and keeping those data in view Koshland proposed a hypothesis as late as 1958 what we understand today as Koshland induced fit model .	2.332993485412268

His proposal was a slight modification of the lock and key arrangement .	3.605134895490123

He said that the substrate has a rigid conformation with its binding sites and the functional site or the reacting groups present at a particular conformation .	3.929035214465615

But the enzyme active site is not a rigid conformation .	6.91158655375887

Itís a flexible conformation .	6.038849107535983

That means as soon as the substrate comes in the proximity of the enzyme active site , initial binding takes place .	3.970481820754082

The enzyme active site binds onto the substrate molecule .	4.705726690555999

For example this is a functional group and this let us say is substrate .	6.552692637875202

The enzyme active site as soon as it comes in proximity , it wraps around the substrate molecule .	3.8781175487503585

He gave an example that the interaction between the substrate and the enzyme is some thing like a hand and the woolen glove .	3.462359882828277

You wear a woolen glove .	5.638624637790718

Your hand is analogues to substrate .	6.301122704107934

Then when you put in the woolen glove it exactly fits into hand depending upon the conformation of your fingers .	2.986548926270641

Everything goes in line and interacts with different fingers and one can be comfortable and the reaction can proceed .	3.2665922728113257

For example you have two binding sites .	6.54198117017034

The free active site on the free enzyme molecule without interaction with the substrate has its particular configuration where the catalytic sites and binding sites are distantly located .	3.5621670230783486

As soon as the binding groups come in contact with the binding site as they have interacted here the active site undergo a change in conformation and this catalytic sites are brought in proximity so as to wrap around the reactive group on the substrate molecule and then the ultimate conformation of the enzyme substrate complex which can use one of the mechanism by which catalytic reaction can take place , can be applied .	3.425087044071452

Such a mechanism very effectively can explain the high degree of the specificity for the enzyme molecule .	3.874032943726044

In the case of induced fit hypothesis one can also appreciate that in certain reactions for example even if there is reaction contaminant in the reaction mixture which are very similar to nature in the terms of their conformation to the actual substrate , they will not be able to interact .	3.438183593636752

For example in the case of lock and key mechanism if there are molecules which are similar in conformation they might be able to partly interact with the catalytic site and influence the reaction .	3.4674871422063647

Whereas in the case of the induced fit mechanism once the enzyme active site is totally wrapped around the substrate , the reaction sites are not at all available for any other contaminant and therefore there is no chance of any other contaminant present in the substrate molecule to be able to interact with the enzyme molecule .	3.465235581339911

One of the most typical examples of enzyme catalyzed reaction which was responsible for the elucidation of induced fit model was the hexose kinase .	2.9757679286944283

The phosphorylation of D - hexose at the expense of ATP to hexose - 6 - phosphate .	3.1019251649535655

In the absence of hexose , the ATP hydrolyzed extremely slowly .	3.3856280281496702

The hexose is present in the proximity of the enzyme , the enzyme will bring both hexose and ATP along with the binding sites and then it can flop around the two molecules and the reaction can take place in a very fast speed .	4.579678743211116

The induced fit mechanism can also explain very clearly the bimolecular reactions which were difficult to understand as far as the lock and key arrangement .	2.752015461265263

Lock and key arrangement was very easily able to explain the unimolecular reactions .	3.683064192725711

But in case where two substrates are involved as in the case of hexose phosphorylation , the role of hexose and ATP both participating at the binding site for the reaction to occur could be explained using induced fit mechanism .	2.844857761677615

If you consider all the three explanations that we have considered today like Oxtenís three site interaction model , lock and key mechanism of Fischer or induced fit hypothesis of Koshland , when we talk about the specificity they donít link specificity by any means to the catalytic function .	2.779135110888724

They consider specificity totally in isolation .	4.891387304636473

None of them is able to provide a suitable explanation for the catalytic function .	4.2429357706123465

When we discussed the various ways in which the enzymes are able to catalyze reactions we understood that binding of the enzyme to the substrate was a very important feature in the acceleration of the reaction rate .	4.4811674713713465

Binding of the substrate to the enzyme involves some expenditure of energy that is the binding energy involved in it which ultimately gives you an advantage in the reduction in activation energy and there is an initial energy .	3.5987074505318923

It is also presumed that this binding energy is not totally a wasteful energy for the enzyme reactions .	3.7145452751974233

A part of this binding energy also contributes to specificity and therefore if you look at the effect of strains that are developed , a hypothesis which is called as a strain that means at the stage of binding we understood that in the case of lock and key mechanism they are rigid .	3.059900922803307

But we might assume that the active site is almost complementary to the substrate molecule but is not exactly complementary , a situation which is slightly closer to lock and key mechanism not in absolute terms that they are complementary but they are not exactly complementary .	3.1298096618393783

Therefore when the substrate and the enzyme active sites are brought in proximity and the binding takes place between the substrate and the enzyme active site it brings in a strain .	3.9612697591014423

You see that the active site here unlike the lock and key mechanism is not exactly complementary .	3.7863155047423005

This slot is slightly longer and therefore while the binding takes place it makes a sort of a strain onto the reactive group and it is analogues to the mechanism which we proposed for catalytic function that means strain mechanism and which contributes to reduction in the enthalpic component of the free energy of activation .	2.848479046307708

During this interaction of the enzyme active site with the substrate , the strain produced onto the reactive group as a result of binding process is responsible for specificity as well as part catalytic function .	4.084649190318727

These strain developed may contribute towards the reduction in activation energy but it is a result of binding process .	4.232041417368071

This binding process brings in the specificity and the nature of the binding site or the active site on the enzyme molecule is slightly complementary or of the similar type but not exactly complementary and the complementarity comes only after binding has taken place which results in the distortion of the reacting group and then the complementary comes in .	3.0162587344857252

So that is called the strain effect which can take into account both catalytic function as well as specificity .	3.727903658991861

The strain effects have been discussed when we were talking about the ways in which the enzyme reduces energy of activation .	3.1993885004501226

The strain on the reacting group was one of the mechanisms .	5.484740825732595

Because the active site is not exactly complementary , after the substrate approaches the binding sites it forces the reacting group to develop a strain so as to bring in complementary to the catalytic sites .	3.4410898577877176

Then only these catalytic sites can combine .	4.593630972979386

Otherwise if it was totally complementary without the strain then the reacting group will come down some where here and no reaction can take place .	2.7228730329834407

Only when a strain is developed the reaction takes place and the reaction takes place with the suitable degree of specificity introducing to it .	3.1250943035170953

Because the binding has to take place and the binding process requires a strain onto the substrate molecule so that it comes in proximity of the catalytic sites .	4.406982513741743

If strain is not developed it will remain in the binding site but not at the active site .	3.8474081486717586

The enzyme will not be able to provide the catalytic function .	5.8739299069528395

Like in the case of other mechanisms or other hypothesis proposed for specificity while we are able to explain that binding will take place , the functional group comes in proximity to the reacting group but it doesnít explain if the reaction will take place or not .	3.332355808819395

Just coming in proximity could provide you an effect what we discussed like high substrate concentration in the proximity of the active site but does not explain you how the energy of activation is induced .	3.03749165830532

Here in this case this also explains how the energy of activation is reduced in terms of its enthalpic contribution .	4.279330448660259

Another thing which is very well related to this strain mechanism is the mechanism what we understand as transition state stabilization .	3.49355208510981

Here in the case the effect is almost very similar to what we call as strain effect but while the substrate enzyme binding takes place at the active site there are still some unfavorable interactions at the active site of the substrate That means the substrate molecule in the vicinity of the active site is not very comfortable in terms of its interactions .	3.625764530353186

The presence of certain unfavorable interactions at the active site for the substrate when the binding has taken place tends to distort the substrate molecule in the direction so that the enzyme substrate complex tends to become complementary to the transition state .	3.4559916490803793

In the first characteristic feature of catalysis we saw that the transition state is complementary to enzyme substrate complex and not the substrate .	3.5685391721445696

The enzyme is complementary to enzyme substrate complex , the enzyme active site and not to the substrate itself .	4.732438563284345

Therefore the role of the binding of substrate molecule to the enzyme at the binding site , the substrate doesnít remain very comfortable .	4.671518510980713

There are many unfavorable interactions that is present there and they distort the substrate molecule so that these enzyme substrate binding approaches towards that of transition complex .	2.933931765384443

The first step is binding of the binding sites onto the active site .	4.9186408060252695

Once that takes place , still the catalytic sites are not approached by the functional groups which are likely to undergo reaction .	3.8082539484889577

But in addition to the binding site there are many unfavorable interactions present between the substrate and the active site .	4.496695743122379

Consider three different functional groups .	8.637667913972201

In addition to that on the active site there will be many more amino acid residues which will be in the proximity and they might provide some kind of unfavorable interactions .	4.120620979746782

Now these interactions tend to distort the substrate and this distortion of the substrate is favored towards reaching the transition state .	3.385104988673774

In other words we are developing a strain onto the substrate molecule so that the substrate molecule reacting groups are coming in proximity to the catalytic site .	3.734533826356935

In the hypothesis of the transition state stabilization it is stated that the unfavorable interactions available at the active sites on the substrate favors the distortion of the substrate in such a way that the final enzyme substrate complex approaches the structure of that of transition state .	3.4358120048155576

Because partly you have already taken up that path .	4.180659717437349

That is what happened in strain development also .	5.32205480971167

Part of the energy required for energy of activation is already met by strain onto the substrate molecule .	3.676376671059235

So these are some of the major mechanisms that have been proposed for explaining the specificity of the enzyme action .	4.277810320670044

It is over all rate of reaction in terms of rate of product formation that indicates whether the enzyme is specific to a substrate or not .	4.615477854752608

What is the order of specificity , to what extent it would be specific , what are the impurities which can interfere in the specificity they are all related to the results of reaction that is the rate of formation of product .	3.9608345660058273

The specificity also has a very significant role in terms of the industrial applications of enzymes .	5.25772197730886

We must also appreciate that while in the case of the catalytic function we understand that if the rate of reaction is increased its usefulness as a industrial catalyst is also very high because higher the rate of reaction you can very efficiently use it for industrial purposes .	3.641944109501841

But what is the role of specificity .	11.069917981813472

The specificity in fact has both negative as well as positive role .	3.9468608399512006

Positive role in the sense , that you can restrict the formation of any of the by - products .	5.44599778535335

Even if your feed history substrate is impure to some extent you will know that only reaction which can be catalyzed specifically by that enzyme which you are providing will take place and no other reaction will take place .	3.186208909097061

Even the side products formed by action of water usually most of the organic chemists consider water for organic chemical reactions as the culprit because it can lead to variety of side products .	2.555620564477597

So all the side products can be absent , which can make our life comfortable as far as the purification of the product is concerned .	3.329928452578058

That means many of the enzymes cannot be produced on a very massive scale because the requirement will be only for single reaction and therefore for a single reaction the requirement will not be very large .	3.3280253875044137

That is why the enzymes still remain expensive catalyst compared to chemical catalyst .	2.89927834627168

For example in the case of chemical catalyst Raneyís nickel , it is the catalyst used for all hydrogenation reactions in the organic chemical field and we can produce them in bulk quantities and the cost of production can be reasonably low .	3.1071482921192497

On the other hand if you have to produce glucose oxidase , which acts only on ﬂ - D - glucose not on a - D - glucose or any other hexose , itís requirement will be only for oxidation of glucose which will restrict its application and therefore the scale of operation .	2.6708210145259828

The specificity must be looked in from both the angle and in many cases today people are applying the development of molecular biology particularly in sense of protein engineering to modify the substrate specificity both when we want the absence of side products to make it more specific as well as when we want broad specificity so that the same enzyme can be applied to a large variety of substrates .	2.8756821196004054

We are trying to broaden the specificity through protein engineering methods .	3.4811492522525866

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In last lecture , we started lattice theory of solutions of small molecules and then , we introduced the thermodynamic probability and Boltzmann equation , how to get this combinatorial entropy from number of distinguishable this degenerate arrangements of a system .	2.8730326715121013

Then , we started our discussion on Flory - Huggins theory on polymer solution .	4.112414548759822

In this case , if you can recollect that polymer molecules , because their size was quite different from the solvent molecules , each polymer molecules were divided into x segments , where each segment was having same size with the size of a solvent .	2.904024192699868

Then with this total segments and the solvent molecules were placed in the 3D lattice like the small molecules .	3.380274024166857

First we introduced the polymer molecules one by one in case of each polymer molecule , segment by segment and then once all the polymers molecules were introduced in the lattice , then we added all the solvents .	3.220788732584334

In that process , we calculated how many different ways , how many distinguishable ways we can introduce all the polymer segments .	3.2052834706800155

Then , we got the entropy of the mixture from the Boltzmann expression and then , we deduce or deducted the entropies of the polymer molecules , pure polymer molecules and the solvent molecules to reach the value for the entropy of mixing for polymer solvent system or polymer solution .	3.6632246143662823

What we got , this is the final expression , we have received .	7.251617515447989

So , in this lecture , what we will do , we will get the expression for enthalpy of mixing .	4.7003898739638705

So , once we get the enthalpy of mixing , we have to get the Gibbs free energy of mixing and once we get the final expression of the Gibbs free energy mixing , then we will look at the usefulness of the Flory - Huggins theory and what are the limitations or deficiencies in the Flory - Huggins theory and then , try to apply this Flory - Huggins theory in the dilute polymer solutions and get the concept of theta temperature .	3.4904005543460364

Now , before we start getting the expression for enthalpy of mixing , just one point just to highlight that this is the expression we received or deduced for entropy of mixing for a polymer solvent .	3.284863141963004

Then phi i , which is the polymer fraction of the solvent molecule can be obtained from the number of moles .	6.725950923359903

This is the molar volume and this is total volume .	6.448443317773135

This is for the ith components .	6.595007822767016

So , we can write delta s m minus r v phi 1 .	3.78365667083068

We also know for ideal solution , in this polymer solution , we assume that the volume of mixture , there is no change in the volume compared to the original volume .	4.434575131120381

Now , what we trying here is to find out if there is , to define the size of polymers , which will have more solubility for a given solvent or if there are , if it is not a solvent , it is two polymers or two different size molecules , then how the entropy of mixing varies with the size of the molecules .	3.8592976428824386

Now , we can divide each molecule , which is represented as i into the segments and one volume ; this is reference volume , which is the size of the individual cells in the 3D lattice .	3.308815854094427

Now , in case of solvent molecules , x i is 1 , so v i is the size of the solvent molecule .	5.01712717081277

For polymer , what we discussed is , x i is the number of polymer segment .	5.251803247211584

See , in this case , we are not mentioning solvent time now .	5.891742232890694

We are just , to make it general , we are using this expression .	4.580702339067075

So , we get from this delta s m equals to minus r v v 0 .	3.5106095974617904

For if , say one was solvent , obviously x 1 is your 1 .	3.5361060844956493

So , you will get back the same expression .	5.788643613440611

Now , what does this expression says that , if the size , if the size x 2 , the value of x 2 , if the value of x 2 goes up or the values of x goes up , then the size of the molecules is going up .	4.053704146183801

If the size goes up , the entropy of mixing comes down .	4.91902987163991

Now , what is the sign of this entropy of mixing of these things ?	4.382930961423041

This is the fraction .	9.604610777387931

Obviously , this is the negative term and there is a negative sign here , so this is a positive term .	5.64759273814689

Obviously , mixing has former general knowledge and general understanding that any mixing generally gives in increase in entropy .	2.2825562269760025

So this entropy mixing is always positive .	5.384486987631809

Now , if the value of this x 1 or x 2 goes up , the value of entropy mixing goes down .	4.903927822946538

Which means that , a polymer having larger size , it will be , which will give less entropy of mixing compared to a polymer having a lower size for a given solvent in given condition .	4.32695187954188

So , for same temperature and pressure and same solvent , if you mix a polymer having same size , it will give lower entropy of mixing than a polymer which is having a lower size .	3.6833914130026497

This is what it does .	6.811702455402295

So , solubilising larger size polymers are always difficult compared to lower size polymers at a given condition .	3.126176996960464

This is what it does .	6.811702455402295

Now , we will move on and try to find out the value of entropy of mixing .	4.648815559808866

Now , enthalpy of mixing is , as you see that , unlike one , where the ideal solution where this interaction , the solvent solvent , solute solute and the solute solvent interactions were having same interaction energy .	3.0753793344662563

In this case , they could be different .	6.935197773666449

So , what we are writing this as , this is interaction energy psi 1 1 epsilon 2 2 and this is epsilon 1 2 .	4.3793602775337055

When a polymer , new polymer , new polymer solvent contact is found , due to polymer getting dissolved in solvent , obviously it comes at the expense of solvent solvent contact and polymer polymer or segment segment contact .	2.4929660062596364

So , we can write a expression like a chemical , pseudo - chemical energy , where half solvent solvent contact and half segment segment contact give 1 polymer solvent contact and we can also write the interaction energy power contact is the interaction energy for polymer solvent minus half of the interaction energy for the solvent solvent plus interaction energy for the segment segment .	2.853645252596695

Now , we know that del v m is 0 , so del h m will be given by q 1 2 .	3.5492896754219796

This is the interaction energy power contact and q is the total number of polymer solvent contacts .	3.6048750374330107

So , if q is the total number of polymer solvent contacts , then enthalpy of mixing will be given q multiplied by the interaction energy for each contact .	3.6267873148317653

Now , one polymer has how many segments ?	4.5153247722640675

One polymer chain has x segments and each segment is in , how many contacts solvent molecules ?	3.4957653576702903

If you go back here , each polymer segment , if all of these are , say for argument , all these neighboring cells has solvent molecules , and then it will have z contacts .	3.335650429633322

One segment will have z polymer contacts ; next one will have z minus 1 contacts ; next one also z minus 1 contact .	2.889676568165775

So , except the two ends , each segment have z minus 1 contact .	3.339969391662802

So , each segment have z minus 1 contact .	4.037575223531258

Now , what is the chance that each of this vacant cells is a solvent molecule or each of this contacts is giving a polymer solvent contact , which is again given by the volume fraction of the solvent molecule because , its segment size and the size of a solvent molecule is same .	3.288383365745225

So , this would be given by the volume fraction .	6.501614156691081

So , the volume fraction of the solvent would be that , forbidding that , each segment or each neighborhood has a solvent molecule .	3.0283403020918827

Now , this is any , just this is not 1 .	5.783972588729278

Each segment ’ s intermediate actually has z minus 2 , one this side and one this side .	3.161421899673729

So , they have z minus 2 contact .	4.902472497595539

Each segment has z minus two 2 , with a neighboring cell other than a polymer .	3.2847530605958006

So , if you consider this segment , it has z minus 2 contacts with other than polymer .	3.160487347443569

Now , what is the chance that the other cells are solvent molecules ?	3.805391996097576

These have to be multiplied by solvent mono - fraction .	5.04107488937287

You can add 2 extra for the two ends , which is z being high , I can just write , we can ignore the two ends and write this .	3.0826264627508433

So , this is each segment having this many polymer solvent contact .	3.4763353601517375

Each polymer has x segment .	6.150909176519172

So , each polymer has how many contacts ?	5.362877889197052

x z minus 2 .	17.141355923802575

So , each polymer has these many contacts with solvents .	3.578765316634115

So , total number of polymer solvent contacts , q would be , n 2 is the number of molecules , polymer molecules x , z minus 2 phi 1 .	3.265016708019478

So , now let us do some maths .	4.897609867705243

phi 1 is given by n 1 n 1 plus x n 2 .	5.575719214461662

Phi 2 is given by x n 2 n 1 plus x n 2 .	4.817283386089

This gives phi 1 x n 2 is n 1 phi 2 .	5.188141732658955

So , I can write this q , instead of phi 1 x n 2 phi 1 x n 2 , I can write z minus 2 n 1 phi 2 .	3.010730240779602

So , this gives the total number of contacts q .	5.020723874729965

So , what will be del h mixture ?	4.597447924857737

It will be q multiplied by 1 2 .	5.416921165731281

This should be z minus 2 n 1 phi 2 .	4.8299321122728305

Now , to remove these terms , which is a little abstract , is the number of coordination number in the lattice .	4.020785464542408

We already defined a term interaction , Flory - Huggins polymer solvent interaction , parameter chi was defined as z minus 2 k T .	2.6687432296173914

k is the Boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature .	3.45705771875293

So , we can write del h m is chi n 1 phi 2 into k T .	2.937746257284924

So , this is the expression for the .	6.534381835420734

We will come back and look at little more deep on the polymer solvent interaction .	3.924695779940131

Parameter is basically gives you the difference when a solvent molecule is taken out from a solvent environment and put in a polymer environment .	4.18811177252583

So , that is the , I guess the interaction energy between a polymer and a solvent and we named as a Flory - Huggins polymer solvent interaction parameter .	2.935452443135351

So , that gives our enthalpy of mixing .	4.785249962077616

So , if we just go back and see what we have seen , now we know the entropy of mixing of a polymer solution and polymer plus solvent is truly , now in this case , the entropy is truly a combinatorial entropy .	3.7796069359263513

Remember , we have only calculated this entropy and the number of ways you can arrange the polymer in the three lattice .	4.395930555630807

So , it is a only configuration or combinatorial entropy .	4.232250514945904

No other entropy is involved in this case .	6.3963921592034305

Now , we calculated the entropy or the enthalpy of mixing as k t , this is mentioned here and you can replace like this also .	3.286811411005129

So , you can write Gibbs free energy mixing of polymer solution by this .	4.614237081981928

This is given .	12.55273308174185

Now , one thing you must ask wondering that , why should you use a lattice like this .	3.021102998173471

Is this justifiable ?	12.162102391224948

In case of a pure liquid or a pure solvent or pure solution , the molecules are very regular , you know , quite regular , so that , we can use such a 3D lattice .	3.2072646971388536

As we have seen that or you know the place of the molecules in the first neighbor , in a solution or in a liquid is quite established , whereas the place of the second neighbor and third neighbor and so on , it will become uncertain .	3.756223353561006

As we have seen that , in deriving this expression or against expression , only we are interested in the first neighbor .	3.1963369656139915

So , this type of model , 3D lattice model is quite justifiable .	3.80892597118052

So , this expression is which we derived using 3D lattice model should be quite justifiable .	3.046907440136186

So , just rewrite this .	7.713263606535553

I am breaking into two terms .	6.25796812376579

This term , as we , this is again .	6.742614745595962

We have so far seen that the performance of idealized continuous flow immobilized enzyme reactors depends primarily on the reaction kinetics and the basic assumption for idealized reactors was that the immobilized enzyme preparation does not experience any mass transfer or partitioning effects .	3.0231064321572756

The immobilized enzymes experience in addition to the catalytic activity three major external effects during immobilization .	3.172249317324751

One is the conformational changes as a result of which the basic turn over number of the enzyme might be altered ; even the value of Michaelis Menten constant may also be altered .	4.22506509781322

The other effect is partitioning of substrate and product which also results in alteration in the Km value of the enzyme reaction .	3.7493875943188613

Then the third effect was mass transfer of substrate and product and this mass transfer as we noticed was at two levels .	2.781219289348716

Or in a very broader sense if you consider the reaction in immobilized enzyme reactor it will imply that in addition to the biochemical reaction there will be four more resistances involved .	4.091551803376494

One will be transport of the substrate from the bulk to the surface ; from surface the substrate has to transport to the site of the enzymatic reaction which means the enzyme molecules that are located throughout the immobilized enzyme particle and then the reverse process that means the product produced as a result of biochemical reaction has to transport back from the carrier interior to the surface .	3.5564394305770066

Therefore the two major matrices which provide resistance to the over all reaction is the thin film around the immobilized enzyme particle and the whole matrix itself and the pores in which the immobilized enzyme is distributed .	3.930435862998244

I think you will also recall what we had seen earlier ; the diagram in which you have a thin film , a stationary film around the particle .	3.6849805775834112

This film thickness will depend on various physical properties of the fluid .	4.6896081597579595

Then you have enzyme distributed all over the pores in the particle and the substrate has to transport from the surface to those materials and similarly reverse .	3.5128891635168196

I like you to have a look at the substrate gradient .	6.413322943837077

If you consider that this regime is the thin film then from the bulk there might be a linear substrate gradient across the thin film and the concentration might drop at the surface and from the surface to the interior of the particle that means to center of the particle there might be again a gradient as a result of biochemical reaction .	3.0249094518022854

Because the substrate will be consumed and as the substrate progresses through the particle depth the concentration will be dropping down and there are two possibilities .	3.601508062378786

One is that you have a rather more convenient situation that from here the substrate concentration goes like a profile like this which is more favorable in the sense that around the whole particle there is some substrate available for biochemical reaction to take place .	3.3865231651818744

On the other hand it can also happen that the substrate concentration drops to zero earlier than the substrate has reached to the middle point and therefore this portion which is highlighted here is deprived of the substrate and the overall reaction rate that is observed apparently is much smaller .	2.9653652116514713

There might be coupled partitioning effects as I have shown in the lower figures in the gradient lower but basically these are the three major issues : biochemical reaction , external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion that are encountered in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor which need to be considered while we consider the reactor performance .	2.8685426278625235

Although in the idealized reactor performance we have not taken into account but in the actual reactors they need to be taken care while analyzing the steady state reactor performance .	3.404471312417013

An important feature of the performance of immobilized enzyme reactor is that one needs to identify the limiting rate , the step which has a limiting rate the lowest reaction rate .	3.9504161902290975

That means a comparison between the biochemical reaction rate and the rate of diffusion by the Ö .	5.110246278896478

film diffusion or the pore diffusion .	7.132774005664579

One must be able to identify by some analytical method or experimental method that which is the rate limiting step and we must analyze or design our reactor keeping in view the rate limiting step .	2.9489884928177807

Consider that we have an immobilized enzyme preparation with a very high enzyme loading .	5.9269738669553895

That means the preparation is highly reactive , the rate of reaction can be very high and the rate of diffusion is slow either because of the Ö. .. of the substrate or the chemical nature of the matrix .	4.541285545950613

If the rate of diffusion is slow in that case the diffusion will become rate limiting .	4.215059690697291

If the difference between the rate of diffusion and the rate of biochemical reaction are too large then one of them will be the controlling factor and the whole reactor design must be based on that particular step .	3.8592295015906064

Alternatively if you take an immobilized enzyme preparation to be very lean loading that means the loading is very low and the catalyst is not very reactive or alternatively the enzyme Ö .	4.771997949998109

that turn over number is very low and the rate of diffusion is very fast .	5.512791219475047

In that case diffusion effectively will not play a key role in the reactor design and the reactor design can be easily taken care by idealized reactor performance considering the reaction kinetics in picture .	3.5460565715480326

Based on these three parameters particularly as I mentioned earlier the conformational changes , mass transfer effects and the partitioning effects , the kinetic parameters for immobilized enzyme are classified into three major classes .	3.029214110348757

One is intrinsic parameters which are the same as that of soluble enzyme which means no partitioning in a soluble system , no mass transfer limitations ; the sole parameter is the reaction rate and they are called the intrinsic parameters .	3.690481746979365

If we consider the rate expression our classical rate expression v = k2E0S / Km + S will apply to the situation .	3.9421109723246093

The second class of the kinetic parameters is defined as inherent parameter .	4.4439473393512605

Inherent kinetic parameters are those which are obtained as a result of conformational changes only .	3.9695379751229343

That means they are dependent on the method of immobilization .	4.786262653408869

That means the kind of reactants we have used in immobilization , the kind of matrix we have used in immobilization and whatever the interaction between the matrix and the enzyme under the conditions of immobilization , whatever conformational changes have taken place , whatever kinetic parameters have been modified as a result of this interaction are considered in the inherent parameters and we define them as ví = kí2E0S / Kím + S The parameters are just given prime and the inherent parameters have no role to play or not much can be done during the reactor design or reactor operation .	2.6283941119832033

They are the final property of the immobilized enzyme , kinetic property .	5.2882126987832745

I must again clearly stress that the inherent parameters do not consider the diffusional effects or the partitioning effects .	3.0716772938272796

That means if the system has no partitioning behavior or no diffusional limitations ; diffusion will be there because there is a phase difference .	3.4472576219029145

But if the diffusion is not the rate limiting step or rather it is quite fast compared to the reaction rate the inherent parameters will be useful .	4.080912644551675

On the other hand in case the mass transfer effects are very severe they can be totally rate limiting steps .	3.5113383835477254

That means the whole rate of reaction is controlled by the rate of diffusion .	5.014611898233445

Biochemical reaction is very fast and the rate of diffusion is slow .	6.259507809370888

The rates may not be absolutely very far apart if the two are very comparable in that case we need to consider our apparent reaction velocity as equal to vapp = kí2E0S / Kappm + S Here when we say that the apparent parameters are those which can be modified , which can be taken care by reactor operation .	3.3733390001397425

That means as I mentioned some time earlier that the thickness of the film can be controlled by either increased linear flow velocity in the case of packed bed reactor or by increasing the agitation speed in the case of CSTR .	3.1763767090252637

Similarly on the other hand the internal flow diffusion also can be regulated by controlling the particle size .	3.858124010386351

That means the distance of transport of the substrate into the immobilized enzyme particle is minimized or reduced .	3.9504841048379786

Therefore the substrate will be available all across the particle and thus can be modified .	4.2502967191981575

Therefore they are called apparent parameters and in all possible analysis we must be interested in the apparent parameters , Kappm .	3.1681431512731955

That will dictate if you want to consider diffusional limitations also as a part of our analysis .	3.6529501461041463

The Kappm has been a parameter which people have tried to define ; quantitatively what are the parameters which can define the Km apparent and one of the most acceptable definitions of Kappm can be Kappm = Kím / PF where P is the partitioning coefficient that is concentration of the substrate in solid phase divided by concentration of the substrate in the bulk phase that is the bulk liquid .	3.347183493305562

On the other hand F is equal to tanh ?	4.669934190946909

l / ?	94.95248240066493

l where ?	27.02100508862881

is the ratio of the kinetic parameters to the diffusional parameters which is defined as ?	5.209908463814702

= Ω [ kí2ES / D.Kím ] 1 / 2 If you see here in this expression kí2ES instead of writing S0 I am writing Es .	3.4637513850043513

D is the molecular diffusivity and kím is the Km value of the enzyme taking into account the conformational changes .	5.144276076378729

The unique part is the parameter P is a fixed parameter and depends on the chemical nature of the substrate and the matrix .	3.912598373551572

Once the method of immobilization is fixed , the immobilized preparation is fixed the value of P is fixed .	4.144191772150966

It behaves almost like a constant parameter .	6.830849732049584

Once the method of immobilization , the nature of the matrix and the substrate are defined the value of P will remain constant and the value of Kappm is dictated by the parameter F and in the case of F what we call as a Thiele function , the form of F is very significant and this can be considered to have a very unique profile .	4.074616317887001

If you consider this function F that is tanh ?	4.350440889606254

l / ?	94.95248240066493

l , the characteristics of this function is that when ?	5.964255137578367

l is less than one that means in this region , the value of F is approximately equal to one .	4.303420540247177

On the other hand when you go at ?	4.108171809692498

l . When you say F is equal to one , there is no effect on the kinetic parameter Km or there is no diffusional limitation in other words .	4.601387628722336

The Km is not altered as a result of mass transfer , diffusion .	5.3815934875325455

F is equal to one and as we defined earlier Kappm was equal to Kím / PF and P we have considered as a constant parameter as far as the immobilized enzyme preparation is concerned and the diffusion does not play a controlling role here if F is equal to one .	3.4455897562517768

On the other hand when the ?	4.478508695088577

l becomes higher than two the value of F is 1 / ?	5.955068894312607

l or it implies that Kappm will be equal to Kím. ?	4.4972033797267565

l / P and therefore the value of Kappm gets altered by a factor of ?	5.282975925579407

l . ìlî is the characteristic dimension of the immobilized particle .	5.952053255818005

If it is a thin film it can be thickness of the film ; if itís a spherical bead it can be diameter of the bead or any characteristics parameter l may be defined as .	3.398825643186475

l is less than one F is approximately equal to one , no diffusion control .	3.7357422503775064

If you just consider the definition of ?	6.0045143022341145

l ? l = l / 2 [ kí2ES / D.Kím ] 1 / 2 This is ?	5.050173577818487

l . Under what conditions ?	9.122255066378587

l will be less than one or a smaller value ?	5.522660584399902

The very condition can be taken from these various parameters .	4.204851168534327

When l is small that means it is a very thin film or very small diameter particles , the value of Kappm will approach to that of Kím and there will be no diffusion control and under ideal condition l is equal to zero for soluble enzyme .	3.375922407995789

So under that condition there will be no diffusion control .	4.384463802035811

Second is D is large .	6.631693027327232

If the rate of diffusion or molecular diffusivity is very high also ?	5.322473020734207

l will be small and therefore also there will be no diffusion control .	3.8271811780638503

Third is Es is small which means low enzyme loading in the matrix .	3.742711407391458

If immobilized enzyme preparation has a small loading the diffusional resistances will not be very controlling .	4.550331916853773

That means catalyst is very slow ; itís turn over number is very low .	3.9896408163578165

kí2 is the turn over number and if the catalyst is slow then also the diffusional limitations will be negligible .	4.468702938593278

Considering these parameters one can design the immobilization enzyme preparation also in such a way that diffusion limitations are not there .	3.4193278629322394

It is always desirable but that is one of the reasons why we call this kinetic parameters apparent parameters .	4.053267402691827

That means they are neither intrinsic nor inherent but they are just apparent and they can be modified if you design your system in a way that you can have a very low enzyme loading to the extent that the overall rate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction is smaller than the rate of diffusion .	3.6873946315733797

The diffusional limitations are wiped out straight away or if you take a smaller particle you can get rid of diffusion .	3.923813854267459

We are considering this parameter the ?	5.370372742826738

l . If the ?	13.953658609610988

l is less than one or smaller value then the magnitude of F is approximately one ; no diffusional limitations .	3.7485541175724

? l will be small when the ES will be small and ES is the enzyme concentration in the matrix in the solid phase , which is the enzyme loading .	4.2182810037512635

Physical interpretation of ?	13.135425701056205

l is the ratio between the biochemical parameters and the diffusional parameters .	5.642083496284492

In the numerator you have k2 and ES .	4.402730086457453

Both are related to biochemical reaction .	6.202688961372651

On the denominator you have D .	5.053299542933439

If you look at higher value of ?	5.322922324695877

l , when ?	28.319175937564385

l is greater than two F is equal to 1 / ?	6.255940450016756

l by basic definitions and therefore F is usually less than 1 .	3.279219240097494

It is inverse of ?	8.544252239530374

l and therefore F is less than one which means the reaction is under diffusional control regime .	5.082286626268612

When ? l magnitude is greater than two you can safely take that the reaction is diffusional limited and Kappm equal to Kappm = Kím .	3.1404932546077107

l . What are the experimental or analytical ways by which we can experimentally determine the rate limiting step ; whether diffusion is rate limiting or not .	3.195928408213621

Various approaches can be adopted .	6.328263864075457

Consider zero order regime .	10.092877310726022

That means at high substrate concentration when you are talking of ?	6.381435551255605

l less than one that means a thin flies or smaller particles reaction rate of the immobilized enzyme will be proportional to enzyme loading .	4.069449737011285

If you make different preparation with different enzyme loadings the reaction rate will be proportional to the enzyme loading .	4.299752194114201

That means as you increase the enzyme loading the reaction rate will also increase .	5.065045694517111

But at low substrate concentration , for ?	9.75326224174318

l less than one and F is equal to one the reaction velocity of immobilized enzyme will become equal to vIME = kí2 P.F.S.ES / Kím That means in the first order regime if you substitute in this parameter Kappm = Kím / PF you get such an expression where F is equal to zero at ?	3.42594833914607

l less than one and v mobilized will be proportional to ES.S .	3.504917121045709

P we are considering as a constant .	7.817738050611603

F is one .	15.265804397821267

So the v immobilized becomes proportional to S.ES , if you consider the low substrate concentration and at a small thickness of particles and ?	3.5250588914759784

In the same case if you take ?	8.61944553311937

l greater than two Kappm is Kappm = Kím .	4.561112278598478

? l / P If you substitute for v immobilized enzyme you get vIME = kí2 / Kappm .S.ES That means a first order kinetics .	3.0364644064165676

We are talking of low substrate concentration .	6.472551836240164

? l is greater than two that means the value of F is 1 / ?	5.202156273612495

l . Under that condition if you substitute the various terms v immobilized enzyme preparation will be proportional to ES1 / 2 .	3.923434215540919

If you substitute here the value of gamma here you will get E1 / 2 .	5.723397407832467

That means the enzyme reaction rate will not be proportional to the enzyme concentration in the particle but will be proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration in the particle .	4.902251519618523

In the case of immobilized enzyme systems which have no diffusional limitations the rate of reaction is proportional to enzyme loading and which is the usual understanding even for soluble enzyme .	3.7473233306136993

Up to a concentration range the rate of reaction is proportional to the enzyme concentration .	5.346737930283513

But on the other hand when the immobilized enzyme preparation is controlled by diffusion , that relationship does not hold good .	3.479417776669073

That means if you make a plot between ln v = 1 / 2ln ES you will get a linear fit and that can be checked experimentally by making preparations of different enzyme loadings and merge in them enzyme reaction Ö. .. .	2.64542552665075

. That is one approach by which one can monitor or determine the concentration of the controlling parameter in the case of immobilized enzyme reaction .	3.7880771489220555

Or in other words as ?	6.366162961689029

l will increase from a small to large value either in thickness or in enzyme loading , behavior will change .	2.662356987597296

Such an experiment can be even monitored .	4.93070251410562

Either you increase the thickness of the particle or increase the enzyme loading .	5.828690964295201

You can see the change in the behavior on the relationship between the enzyme loading and the enzyme reaction rate .	5.784461115040661

That can give you an indication of the controlling parameter .	4.982867159404811

Another way is to look at the Lineweaver - Burk plot .	5.007473724905727

In the case of a classical enzyme catalyzed system we have 1 / v Vs 1 / S .	3.424606271419949

When we are talking of S , we are talking of Sbulk because we are not monitoring the concentration of the substrate inside the reactor but we are concentrating on 1 / Sb .	3.9898972384029956

Normally we will get such a behavior where slope will be Kím / vím or Kí2E0 .	4.33678012628273

But in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation which are regulated by diffusional limitations the curve usually convex to the 1 / S axis .	3.148650921164502

That means it will be something like this , where the slope is Kappm / vím .	4.708394794944165

By plotting the Lineweaver Burk plot for immobilized enzyme preparation one can also identify the extent of diffusional limitations because then the Kappm drastically changes .	3.4801972660508844

When you do the Kappm , partitioning is fixed , the value of F can be noticed and F can give you a value of ?	3.8258681411470445

l . So in that way also one can determine .	6.6309887545164425

One of the reference which has analyzed the diffusional limitations is given by Reagon and associates in Biotech Bioengineering , 16 .	3.4629339387781095

1081 , 1974 .	81.5832344388429

In fact one of the earlier references in mass transfer analysis of an immobilized glucose oxidase particles was made and is given in this .	3.066894534272861

The third approach of analyzing the diffusional limitation is on the basis of activation energy .	4.2748745720474775

To illustrate my point I think I like to make you familiar with one of the experimental data which was reported .	3.9633717706820804

This is ln v verses 1 / T for acetyl choline esterase immobilized in polyacrlyamide gel particles .	2.548740835558943

When the estimation of activation energy was made under different substrate concentration regimes and with immobilized particles , one noticed a profile something like a biphasic profile .	2.550169782841249

That means the activation energy got changed .	5.738594602888782

Consider another situation in which at the low substrate concentration when ?	4.021372031642588

l is greater than two when diffusional control was established , the energy of activation noted was ?	3.16269358740689

E * which was equal to 5.7kcal / mole .	5.369222327018061

On the other hand at high substrate concentration , when ?	4.327606310602039

l was high one gets the same kind of energy of activation at high temperatures .	3.7751619792819238

At high temperatures these similar activation energy was obtained even at high substrate concentration as in the case of low substrate concentration because at high temperatures the reaction rate was high .	3.422885039676679

The reaction rate being high , the diffusion became limiting .	3.609672220008843

The activation energy behaviour was almost similar as in the case of low substrate and at high ?	3.773818694517105

l which was established parameters for diffusional limitations .	4.139892853564871

The right hand side profile , a straight line profile refers to a thick particle where the thickness is high ; ?	3.332430982078984

l is greater than two and at low substrate concentration .	4.522684006516669

We know under these conditions the system will be diffusional limited and the activation energy computed in this case was 5.7 kcal / mole .	3.315372221753215

When you go over to high substrate concentration over the range of substrate , over the range of temperature initially at high temperature range almost a similar activation energy was obtained 5.7 .	2.9593829564705443

That means the system behaves almost like diffusional limited even at high substrate concentration which it should not .	3.593926112103305

At high substrate concentration the system should not behave as a diffusion limited system because at higher temperatures the reaction rate is higher and the diffusional limitation was established .	3.4148600155639453

On the other hand when the temperature was reduced the system became diffusional unlimited and the activation energy was much higher , which was 9.4 kcal / mole .	2.4833460937881067

So a change in the activation energy over a range of temperature also indicates the diffusional limitation behavior .	3.963219449933819

Therefore we have three distinct approaches to monitor by experimental methods the effect of diffusional limitation in the case of immobilized enzyme particles .	3.767351605544523

One is by seeing the effect of enzyme loading on the reaction rate that means itís proportionality to the enzyme loading changes from linear to proportional to the power half .	3.9599440417674163

The second is the nature of the Lineweaver Burk plot which becomes convex to the 1 / S in X - axis which means that the enzyme is more sensitive to diffusional limitations at lower substrate concentration .	3.196723162853369

At higher substrate concentration the profile is more or less linear .	5.235421133975383

But as it increases to higher substrate concentration the slope tends to increase and the Kappm value increases .	3.013431600026143

The third is the estimation of activation energy over a range of temperature .	3.502132491225968

By the experimental reactor operations in the laboratory many people have noticed that diffusional limitations play a key role either by varying the agitation speed in the case of a CSTR or by the varying the linear flow velocity in the case of PFR , the rate of reaction can be improved and so diffusional limitations can be overcome if any .	2.5829755593805026

The question is how to analyze a practical situation .	4.620751967435565

That means if suppose you want to know how we can determine the actual value of the mass transfer coefficient .	4.611598308966732

In that case before we go to a total mass transfer a closed box picture of diffusion we can break it into the external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion and look them separately and check if they can be analyzed along with the chemical reaction under steady state behavior because even the enzyme reactor that we have looked at are to be analyzed under steady state situation .	2.870838269238339

If you look at immobilized enzyme reactor performance with external film diffusion that means the substrate may be very thick .	4.405640222621967

There is a thick film of substrate around the immobilized enzyme particle which will cause a substrate gradient across the film and therefore the concentration of the substrate at the surface of the immobilized enzyme particle is not same as in the bulk .	3.7619688364074415

Ideal situation could be to consider a non - porous particle , where all the enzyme will be on the surface and the sole diffusional limitation is as a result of transport through the thin film .	3.4617184641680994

One of the empirical methods to determine the Kappm apparent was given as Kappm = Kím + kí2 E0d / D Purely an empirical solution to describe the problem .	2.4207314111376648

That means the Kappm will be dependent on the thickness of the film .	3.978035147633006

Logical because of the thickness the mass transfer tends to be more .	6.614994881465637

Then D is inversely proportional to the rate of the diffusion ; that is also quite obvious .	4.745021084814219

Now the problem is that experimental measurement of the film thickness is not an easy task .	3.776436515685664

One cannot really , for any immobilized enzyme reactor , measure the film thickness and then make a design computation .	3.3678703838936213

So therefore an alternative analytical method has to be chosen and if you look at analytical methods the best way is to look under steady state reactor performance .	3.2976710698045704

Let us say you have an immobilized enzyme particle which is non - porous in nature .	4.753598539062721

All the enzyme is immobilized on the surface , a typical particle on which enzyme is only on the surface .	4.561619536202126

There is a layer of film through which the substrate has to diffuse to reach to the enzyme active site and as a result of this there is a concentration gradient .	4.070498710138049

For simplicity one can assume a linear gradient and so therefore rate of mass transfer here will be equal to rm = klam ( Sb - Ss ) This is Sb ; this is Ss .	2.8435045146156934

That is the concentration gradient .	9.912208971468434

The rate of diffusion in such a situation let us assume the situation that this non - porous particle is packed in packed bed reactor and we operate it till a steady state is reached ; steady state reached means the concentration of the substrate at the exit end becomes constant with time .	2.8716844624845455

Rate of mass transfer , rate of reaction are identical .	7.324231142283427

Thatís the mass transfer coefficient .	6.521088243094037

am is the area of the mass transfer which is described as area cm2 / cm3 ; that means the surface area per unit volume of the particle .	3.957293839252763

kl is the mass transfer coefficient cm / sec .	5.998742328422593

So overall klam will have unit of per second .	3.8660928449425653

A typical first order rate constant .	5.786286697202113

Sb - Ss is the concentration gradient across the thin film .	6.042280590566655

This under steady state conditions must be same as the rate of a reaction and that is v = kí2E0SS / Kím + SS If you substitute the magnitude of the Ss from this expression and simplify you get kí2E0 [ Sb - ví / klam ] ví = Kím + [ Sb - ví / klam ] The steady state rate of reaction will be given by this expression and the Ss will be equal to Sb - Rn or ví / klam and therefore and 1 / ví will be equal to 1 / ví = Kím / kí2E0 ( 1 / Sb - ví / klam ) + 1 / kí2E0 That gives you the 1 / ví If you consider the extreme conditions , that is when Sb is very high or we are considering zero order regime .	3.589208123503918

From this expression you can get 1 / ví = Kím / kí2E0 .1 / Sb + 1 / kí2E0 In the case of very high substrate concentration in a zero order regime .	5.297985303535413

On the other hand when Sb is very small or a first order regime , if you look at the this equation from here you get ví = kí2E0 / Kím ( Sb - ví / klam ) or if you simplify and take all the ví term onto the left hand side you will get kí2E0 klam.Sb ví = Kím klam + kí2E0 You can simplify or 1 / ví for small Sb will be equal to 1 Kím 1 ví = ( + ) .	2.812568191347574

Or in other words you consider two in graphical form .	3.619318826744945

You will get something like this ; almost a typical profile as we discussed earlier that it becomes convex to 1 / Sb ; 1 / ví .	3.997009143200869

The slope of this straight line will be , at low substrate concentration , 1 / klam + Kím / kí2E0 .	4.056073865048533

On the other hand the slope here will be Kím / kí2E0 .	3.386274855561386

The difference between the two slopes is the 1 / klam .	5.210887495623844

So one can experimentally determine the magnitude of klam by carrying out the immobilized enzyme reaction in a continuous reactor and getting the steady state performance of the klam and from that Kím and k2E0 and once you know klam you also know the substrate concentration gradient Sb - Ss by the first equation where you have related the rate of mass transfer because that is klam. ( Sb - Ss ) .	3.492439697851535

Rate of reaction and the mass transfer rate are identical under steady state situation and therefore they can be experimentally determined and one can then take the parameter which takes into account the immobilized enzyme reactor performance incorporating the external film diffusion .	3.498699263003596

In this case we have only considered the external film diffusion ; on the other hand actual reactor may also involve , if it is porous particle general pore diffusion also .	3.0943666750018783

Such an analysis is applicable only for non - porous particles or in case particle size is very small where the pore diffusional limitations are to be taken as negligible and we will continue with that in subsequent classes .	3.3663092497605818

And in this project we will discuss the leftover discussion on the termination reaction in cationic chain polymerization .	3.504730625215673

We will also discuss the kinetics and energetics of cationic chain polymerization and then move to anionic chain polymerization talk about the features of anionic polymerization , and then like the cationic chain polymerization talk about different ways of initiation and propagation and termination reactions .	3.6763916574682542

And briefly we will touch upon the energetics of this anionic chain polymerization , and then in the end we will talk about this , a few practical considerations for anionic chain polymerization , both cationic and anionic .	3.475711538148773

Now , let us just quickly recap what we covered in last lecture on ionic chain polymerization .	3.426297701640614

We talked about general features of all the characteristics of ionic chain polymerization and its comparison with radical polymerization .	3.9241126867945786

We talked about selectivity of the monomers with about the importance of solvent polarity in case of ionic polymerization .	4.036341383270078

We talked about the nature reaction is very fast reaction and we also talked about the inherent difference in the termination reaction between radical chain polymerization and ionic chain polymerization .	4.568411656050251

We talked about cationic chain polymerization in particular detail where we talked about different types of initiation reactions and then propagation .	3.9925066325928653

And we just initiated discussion on termination and as we discussed , that in case of both cationic and anionic , polymerization is bimolecular , bimolecular reactions between these propagating species is , so termination is not that , done that way .	3.4692769230728793

Typically , the terminations happen or typical termination happens in by the chain transfer and there are several possibilities of chain transfer reaction in case of cationic chain polymerization .	3.548739549033831

And we just started giving examples , which chain transfer with monomeric species and what we will do .	2.707543843135624

We will just begin our discussion in this lecture from that page .	4.769987148557675

We were discussing in this last lecture the termination by beta proton transfer to different species and we gave examples of the transfer reaction with monomer .	3.016510958257226

And just note the rate constant we are giving and with the same rate constant , the same notation , what we used for radical chain polymerization , k tr M I .	3.25861897968997

just said , that there could be two possible double bond in case of this monomers , like isobutylene , alpha methyl styrene .	5.007328322455299

But for the examples , monomers like styrene , it will be only one double bond possible because in case of styrene you have only one possibilities of beta transfer .	3.4989912054416776

Now , let us talk about other possibilities .	4.486289324501159

In this case we talked about chain transfer to counter ion .	4.83215965414602

And these , these are basically similar as in the case of transfer to monomers , so I am just going through quickly these different types of chain transfer .	3.719163442383115

Here , the proton is transferred to the counter ion itself .	4.75990732842432

So , you get a dead polymer class species as in the case of the transfer to the monomer .	4.218840573715506

And in , like in monomer case , the resulting species out of or as a result of chain transfer reaction is same as the initiating species .	3.6939380764099163

You remember , if you recall this initiating species for this reaction of polymerization of isobutylene by BF 3 plus water , this was the initiating species .	3.2093440580447634

So , what happened is , in spite of this chain transfer reaction , the rate of polymerization does not slow down because this has the same reactivity with the existing kinetic chain , only thing happens because of this chain termination , chain transfer , the molecular weight actually gets reduced .	3.331009570797357

Similarly , in this case , this can again reinitiate a cationic polymerization .	5.748126645119827

So , rate does not get influenced much , whereas the molecular weight get drops .	3.9965684036656657

And this is again using the same examples , the chain transfer to counter ion .	3.9631238161763895

Chain transfer to polymer is possible and for example , this is the styrene polymerization , cationic polymerization .	4.783415747159974

In this case , intra - molecular photon transfer is possible , which actually gives you a dead polymer chain and again initiated to coinitiator complex and if inter - molecular chain transfer happen , chain transfer to polymer happens , then you get a branched , branched chain or you get branched , branched polymer .	2.898176241324913

So , this is very similar to reactions we have discussed in case of chain radical chain polymerization .	4.752487538274558

Chain transfer also can be possible to the other substance , whether it is present as in impurities or you have added deliberately as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight .	3.7208992789706508

For example , this is generic structure of the chain transfer agent , which could be water , alcohols , esters , acids or anhydride , etcetera .	3.809329035057711

And it can participate in the chain transfer reaction and giving away new catalyst , cocatalyst complex , which again can reinitiate a cationic chain polymerization .	3.0949753970617526

So , again this reduces the molecular weight of the cationic chain polymerization .	4.7044707255147795

Now , there is one more termination is possible , which is not a transfer reaction , which is basically in true sense , which is a termination reaction where this counter ion and this ionic species , the cationic properties can species combine into to form a covalent ball .	3.615437339868673

Now , in this case it is a true termination reaction because here you are not forming anything else , we can restart the , or reinitiate the polymerization .	2.9744574181096297

As you know , in absence of water this cannot initiate the chain by itself .	4.096911703974859

So , this is in that sense not a transfer reaction and it is a true sense a termination reaction , and you can just note down the example of this termination reaction .	4.845655691474037

Now , there could be some agents , reagents present , like in case of radical chain polymerizations where this reagent actually can slow down the cationic chain polymerization considerably .	3.092640712286969

So , they can act as inhibitor or retarder in case of cationic chain polymerization , like we talked about different retarder or inhibitor , like in case of radical chain polymerization .	3.4053787113154934

For examples , amines , triaryls , trialkyl phosphates , triophenes , they can actually act as inhibitor .	3.0811856240943514

So , once this is formed , this cannot reinitiate or this cannot actually take part in further propagation reactions , which means , this chain actually gets inhibited by this type of reaction .	3.081768889655974

So , like radical chain polymerization there are molecules or reagents , which you can or may be undesirably they are present in they can be present in cationic chain polymerization .	3.5784777738337743

So , we just talked about different possible possibilities of initiation reaction , propagation reactions and types of termination reactions possible in case of cationic chain polymerization .	3.2839641286785373

Now , let us talk about the kinetics of or get some , introduce kinetic expression in case of cationic chain polymerization .	3.14410435168366

Again , we will consider , like I said , we consider , consider the most important example of the initiation reaction and we consider the generic expression… minus , and so these are the two steps consist , you know , make the initiation reactions .	3.5108355332125307

See , if I write expression for rate of initiation , it would be ki , concentration of this species , Y plus IZ minus and concentration of monomer .	3.906341777480643

As I mentioned earlier , that here in the rate expression for initiation reactions this monomer is appearing where in case of radical chain polymerization , monomers was not present in terms of , in the rate expression of the initiation reaction .	3.8208349043799883

Now , if you get the value for this form this equilibrium , we can write ki I YZ M .	4.723236382946357

Let us write the propagation step , write this generic expression .	4.457079285947905

So , rate of polymerization , R p , is given by k p , concentration of… And the monomer .	3.959302200074779

Termination reactions , now let us consider the true termination reaction , which is the combination of the cationic propagating species with the counter ion .	4.661311951448066

We are not considering for this kinetic expression , the other time transfer reaction , so we can write k t IZ .	3.6574759017623806

So , R t , rate of termination is given by the concentration of… Now , for simplicity just write , like the earlier case where in case of radical polymerization let us write this only , M plus… So , this is the summation of concentration of all the cationic species present in the reaction medium , M 1 , M 2 , M 3 and so on .	3.5748222390621835

So , for simplicity we are just writing , omitting this subscript and writing this M plus .	2.814416936759401

Again , this is the summation of the concentration of all the cationic species , propagating species present in the medium .	4.627837515160407

Now , at steady state you can equate R i n R t to get the concentrate , concentration of… like , in case of , we have a similar approach in case of radical chain polymerization , so we get this .	3.6544798805273184

So , R p similarly can be obtained in k p I YZ .	3.9932984927393145

Here , the rate of polymerization depend on the square of this monomer concentration where in case of radical polymerization , if you remember , is the , it was related to the concentration of monomer .	4.199009591401699

That is because this monomer is appearing in the rate expression of the initiation reaction , as well in ionic polymerization , whether in the case of radical polymerization this monomer was absent in the initiation reaction .	3.639227153063004

So , I can write the degree of polymerization , like R p by R t , which gives k p M by k t .	4.001133577428376

Now , similarly , transfer reactions happen , I can write X n R p plus summation of all the chain terminating reactions .	3.5651164821628663

So , R ts plus R transfer monomer plus R transfer solvent and so on .	2.920802893445748

So , we can just simply write X n as k p M k t k ts chain transfer to the counter ion , chain transfer to the monomer and chain transfer to the solvent or any other substance or you can add , if they are other chain transfer reactions present .	3.6604602984592725

So , similarly , like in case of chain polymerization we can write this expression .	6.660993332969422

This is X n bar 0 is the degree , number of degrees of polymerization , absence of any chain transfer reaction .	4.209342897601821

So , increasing the solvent concentration , which is taking part in the chain transfer reaction or increasing the monomer concentration or similar , similar thing , we can describe exactly like the chain transfer reactions for radical polymerization .	3.3817897112817525

So , let us talk about the energetic , which means , that the effect of the temperature on the reaction rate and molecular weight , like in case of radical polymerization if you just recollect this , this is the expression for your R p , rate of polymerization , and this is the expression for your average degrees of polymerization .	4.182889462905363

So , we can write , similarly activation energy for reaction E i , initiation , plus E propagation minus termination and E X n bar 0 in absence of any chain transfer rate reagent we can write this .	2.831237946780568

Now , typically in case of cationic polymerization both E i and E p are lower than the termination activation energy as can be justified because that bimolecular termination is not possible and E p values are typically for minus 20 to 40 kilojoule per mole , which also depends on the monomer structure for same monomers .	2.6772251727084844

It , the activation general propagation will of course , depends on the initiator or coinitiator and the solvent .	3.518006502719753

For example , thus , lets , this E p values is around no E p around , comes around , say 22 .	2.5417616811222716

Let us go back and this E r value , it can be positive or negative and values is typically from minus 20 to 40 kilo joule per mole .	2.8579033013292467

So , if I want to find out the defect of rate of cationic chain polymerization with temperature we get this E R like R t case and depending upon the value or sign of E R you can tell whether the reaction rate will increase with temperature or not .	3.184503567551002

If this E R is negative , then R p goes up with temperature goes down ; if it is positive , then R p goes up with increasing temperature .	3.5466192425451513

Now , do not confuse , that activation energy for reaction is negative .	4.099853222736531

No single reaction cannot , no single reaction can have negative activation energy .	3.185244484483194

The activation energy for reaction in cationic chain polymerization could be negative , that is because it is a combination of activation energy for initiation , propagation and termination reaction .	4.17492076637926

If that activation energy for the termination is higher than the combination of activation energy of initiation plus propagation , then it will become negative , so the rate increases with the temperature .	4.089554069019832

If this is negative , if it is positive , then the rate of reaction increases with the temperature .	5.008254854814683

Similarly , you can write the expression for the molecular weight X n 0 in absence of chain termination reaction .	5.200446193043169

So , the molecular weight always decreases , sorry , molecular weight always goes up .	3.752361423547189

If you decrease the temperature of the reaction , that is why cationic polymerization .	6.439779956711545

But any chain polymerization in most cases performed in a environment or sub - zero temperature .	3.770140689796578

Now , if you consider this chain transfer reaction or chain transfer constant , C is , say for chain transfer to the monomer is given by k tr is this d ln C by dT is given by E tr minus E p is divided by R T square .	3.397147741715872

So , we found , that even for the reactions where transfer reaction is absent , if we decrease temperature the molecular weight goes up .	3.744220876541193

The cases where transfer reaction present , the transfer constant goes down with decrease in temperature , as a result , that molecular weight goes up .	3.6014598956936745

So , for cationic chain polymerization , no matter whether chain transfer reaction is present or not , you always end up having higher molecular weight .	3.5481870862841514

If it is negative , then with decreasing temperature you get increase in polymerization rate , but if it positive , then with decrease in temperature you get reduction in the polymerization rate .	3.027537727526429

Now , if we can , if you can do reactions where you do not have these side reactions or this chain transfer reaction , then you can keep this propagating cations , cationic propagating chains alive and you can get living cationic polymerization .	3.750356113684201

Now , we are not going to details about the living cationic polymerization in this course , but there are , though it is very difficult in case of cationic polymerization , in , in a very careful manner if you can do reactions where you reduce or minimize the chain transfer reaction and the side reactions , then there is a possibility , that you can get a living chain polymerization .	3.9014368833729187

Now , this cationic chain polymerization can be utilized to synthesize telechelic polymers as well , where telechelic term means , low molecular weight , typically less than 20K molecular weight with a functional group at end , which can be utilized for further reaction .	3.2619212362230057

For example , we take this reaction , general reaction .	4.4460325708523625

So , you can consider these , reactions of this with isobutylene and you get propagating chain like this , which can again react with alkyl halide .	3.4877786739352516

You know now , this chloride can be utilized , reacted to form several types of groups , say like NCO or CH 2 H or group or something like that .	2.536207926203768

So , by this way you can , you can terminate a cationic chain polymers with a desired molecule , in this case alkly halide , and you can make functional groups at the end , which you can utilize to form different functional groups and then for the reactions impossible in that functional groups .	3.6088222706825266

Sometimes in cationic polymerization you also , if you do a characterization of the polymers you gained at the end of cationic chain polymerization you might get or you might see there is a bimodel distribution on the molecular weight .	3.941060596933602

Now , in that case what might had happened , that there could be possibility of simultaneously present of two different types of this ionic associated counterions .	3.5111136420680187

And as we know , that the reactivities of the free counterions or the solvent separated counterions are much different than tight iron - pairs .	3.19801262801815

If they are present in significant amount , then they will propagate in a different way that might lead to different , differentiate of molecular weights , which might results in a bimodal type distribution of these resulting polymers .	2.644507606187534

Now , what are the practical considerations in case of , say , cationic chain polymerization ?	4.618213972330185

For a successful cationic chain polymerization , as we just discussed , usually done , usually done at a temperature lessen than 0 degree centigrade because as we have seen , that with reducing temperature you can get a higher molecular weight or molecular weight increases with a decreasing temperature .	3.3378705536479916

Now , you have to maintain moisture free environment and if you , and if you are actually using H 2 as a cocatalyst , then we should add H 2 O in the symmetric amount with respect to the catalyst because moisture or H 2 is present in excess than what you desired as a cocatalyst .	2.8887040476193384

Then the cationic propagating species will react immediately with the water molecule and terminate the polymerization or propagating chain .	3.46664305195697

And for the same reason , the purity of , purity of monomers are very important .	4.224094709052419

If there are impurities , which can undergo side reaction , do chain transfer reactions , then there molecular build up is a problem and these reactions , because oxygen is also a .	3.0294849346343184

For this cationic polymerization an inert atmosphere is needed and for that the nitrogen or the argon gas , which are used for creating the inert atmosphere .	2.868031963254104

They must be purified very and because these reaction are very fast reaction , sometimes it happens in seconds and the cationic chains reactions , actually you can make arrangements to , to perform the reaction , you might have to arrange or purify the monomer and the gas nitrogen , argon and you have to make this your container or the reactor moisture free .	2.897121418062018

For that you might spend lot of time , but reaction happens very quickly within second and because it happens so quickly , generate lots of heat and sometimes there is a heat management is also a problem .	2.767252360847726

Now , for all these reasons , as I said in the very beginning , that doing or carrying out this cationic chain polymerization in large scale industrial scenario is very difficult , that is why , this cationic chain polymerization are not practiced commercially for many monomers .	3.2407255922100426

The only monomers , which are synthesized in commercial scales is butyl rubber .	4.255984310678201

Butyl rubber , which is basically copolymer of isobutylene , the example of which we get many times in this lecture and small quantities of isoprene , this is done at very low temperature , 90 degree centigrade with aluminum chloride catalyst and in chlorinated solvent .	3.0104492004407186

Now , this butyl rubber has remained flexible at low temperature , like minus 50 degree .	3.1985850472835584

So , they are used in the inert use of the tyres engineer , autobody mounts and electrical cable insulator , protective gloves , etcetera and some form of stoppers .	2.4461193331574362

So , this is the only polymers or copolymers used , which utilized this cationic chain polymerization commercially .	3.530406090282203

Now , let us move to the next topic of anionic chain polymerization .	3.182255651464757

Now , it is similar to cationic , but there are some significant differences as well .	3.9190673216936487

One difference is that the difference in the activity of these different ion - pairs is much , much strong in case of anionic polymers , anionic chain reactions , which means , that reactivity of free ion , the difference in reactivity of free ion - pair , which is a tight ion - pair , is much more important in case of ionic chain polymer , anionic chain polymerization than in case of cationic chain polymerization .	3.667767304175744

There could be the other differences as well and this is not , at not , as temperature sensitive , as cationic polymerization .	4.028742413132144

And generally , E R , the activation of is positive , small positive .	3.337574060486524

So , if you decrease temperature , rate of reaction goes down .	5.139955489732467

So , generally reactions are down at ambient temperature or may be slightly higher than ambient temperature solvent is very important , even more in case of anionic polymerization you can , the solvents are mainly used is aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons .	2.870482359719313

Now , other difference of anionic polymerization with cationic polymerization is this possibility of the transfer reaction .	3.6246282849223395

Now , in case of cationic we have seen , that in case of cationic we have seen very fissile beta proton transfer or elimination reaction happening for this transfer reaction , where in case of anionic polymerization you require beta hydride elimination for those transfer reactions with monomer solvent and counterion , all these things to happen .	2.772115873260811

Now , hydride elimination is not very easy thing .	6.290747371893864

So , this extent of transfer reaction for anionic polymerization is much less compared to cationic polymerization , which means , that the side reactions and the , cation , the chain transfer reactions are very less if you have a very pure monomer and moisture free environment .	4.122574948598569

That is why , leaving anionic polymer polymerization , leaving anionic polymerization is comparatively easier than cationic polymerization because you , in case of cationic polymerization , these transfer reactions are very common and fissile , where in case of anionic this transfer reaction is required beta hydride elimination , which is , which is not easy thing .	2.9322562171203645

So , leaving anionic polymerization is quite often easily achieved compared to a living cationic polymerization .	4.011887641772221

Now let us talk about the three steps , initiation , in case of anionic polymerization are initiation .	3.736629686016168

Most important is using alkyl lithium .	4.931191291008895

For example , I have this butyl lithium , which can react with monomers CH 2 … This alkyl lithiums are equal to , make this , this curve initiator soluble in organic solvent or soluble in non - polar solvent , as we have seen earlier , how we have discussed earlier , that anionic polymers are typically down at aliphatic hydrocarbons , aromatic hydrocarbons .	2.754555972478929

Other initiations possible by electron transfer , electron transfer , for example , reaction between sodium and naphthalene .	3.0875950167079873

Now , this can react with 1 mole of same molecules , let us , this is another possibility where sodium can react with naphthalene by electron transfer , you can generate anionic species , which can initiate it , can react with the monomer to initiate the chains .	3.1188600833573323

If I write the chain initial reaction for that electron transfer reaction , it can react with the monomer to initiate the chain say Y s , styrene , we are talking about styrene polymerization here .	3.277562366757906

This , it is , in it now this can primarize .	5.733610521179537

This is the example of how initiation is done with electron transfer .	4.221092744884871

In this case we took example of sodium and naphthalene and in this case you can see this final or initiate thing chain species form is this , which actually can extend or propagate from both the sides .	2.606309897556248

So , you can have reactions happening in both the , propagation happening in both the sides .	3.7807563033669465

If we talk about the , this propagation of this butyl lithium reaction , which is , this is butyl lithium , which is common and more important .	3.8018581326896927

Let me write the propagation reaction for that , generic propagation reaction , and if you talk about the propagation reaction of this , this species , then you can write propagation reaction .	5.012252106726692

This is what the propagation reaction will generically look like .	4.432483734573938

In both this case , this initiation by alkyl lithium and also by this electron transfer , you do not have any inherent termination reaction .	3.3009881228968307

So , the reaction can proceed without a termination reaction or and the reaction of the propagating chain can remain leaving .	4.103481006604974

But if you , if you want to stop the reaction for whatever reason , then you can add an agent , which could be alcohol or water , which can actually react with , immediately with these active anionic carboionic chain end and stop the reaction .	3.197412834541548

So , termination reaction , if you can add H 2 O or say methanol or any other alcohol and which can terminate this reaction very quickly .	4.182096265778136

Now , this is not sufficiently neucleofilic to reinitiate a chain polymerization , which also means , that if you have H 2 O present , undesired H 2 O present giving the polymerization medium , in a , in the polymerization medium , then it has very detrimental effect in terms of molecular rate build up because if there are trace amount of history also , this will immediately react with the propagating carbon ion anionic end and stop the reaction immediately , which will have very detrimental effect in terms of building molecular weight .	2.99717405997567

Now , they are , there are , there are not termination reactions for these type of initiation or propagation reaction , but some polar monomers can have side reactions present , which actually can , which actually can determine or be detrimental for your molecular weight build up .	2.7992881569579553

And there are other possible initiation reactions , which we will discuss in the next lecture where inherently , there could be termination reactions possible .	3.733622227877173

So , what we have done in this lecture ?	7.065000394232166

We have talked about general features of anionic polymerization .	4.93122535654411

Anionic polymerizations , as I said that it is much more solvent dependent compared to cationic , cationic chain polymerization .	4.161392609813224

So , it is always comparatively easy to carry out leaving anionic polymerization than leaving cationic polymerization .	3.121350046262045

And we talk to define initiations possibilities of this anionic polymerization and most important of this is using alkyl lithium .	3.5964085899615017

So , if one requires to terminate the chain , you can add externally this H 2 O or alcohol to terminate the chain .	3.3366074799114265

In next lecture what we will talk ?	10.600145041029368

We will start giving that example of the side reactions in case of the polar monomers like methyl methaculate or or methyl vinyl or methyl ketones where the side reactions , the molecular build up is difficult .	3.013843806122469

And also , we gave example of other type of initiation reactions where there could be inherent termination reaction .	3.8180826251935884

And in the in next , next lecture you also consider the little bit of energetic , how the temperature affects the anionic polymerization and how the molecular weight distribution is in case of anionic chain polymerization and how to get the molecular weight from the initial monomer and initiator ratio .	3.823397305032306

So , with this we , I stop this lecture and in the next lecture I will continue with this anionic chain polymerization .	3.7045306530239546

And and we will start the other type of polymerization in the second half or the latter half of the next lecture .	4.749706601237261

You would recall that in our previous lecture we had discussed what are immobilized enzymes , why should we immobilize enzymes and what are the requirements of immobilization of enzymes and the three major requirements – a soluble enzyme and the carrier and method of immobilization .	3.275393252269936

We were looking into their characteristics .	4.823996865493523

The soluble enzyme , as we all know , required for immobilization must have certain properties that is it should possess high specific activity and also desirable functional properties that are required for use of immobilization enzyme .	2.587395570513198

A large numbers of methods of immobilization are reported in literature .	3.765015417674944

Most of them can be classified simply into three major categories one is carrier binding methods .	3.0974355161028377

Typical examples are adsorption ; covalent binding and we will be discussing them in detail .	4.258415187403337

The other method is cross linking .	5.214914902263592

The enzymes themselves posses a large number of functional groups which can be made to react to each other , thereby aggregating the molecules and making them insoluble in water .	3.520904900448157

Just to repeat the cross linking refers to linking more than one enzyme molecule through their functional residues present on their surface .	2.9058092122982395

Most of the enzyme molecules will have a large number of functional residues .	8.242395135380788

They may be hydrophobic groups ; they may be electrostatic charges or other functional residues .	3.199918368642127

They can be linked under certain conditions , under ambient condition so that their inactivation is not allowed and on those conditions aggregates of the enzymes can be made which can function as immobilized enzymes .	2.770119356609724

The third type of method is entrapment methods where the enzymes are entrapped within a matrix .	3.7822705752336567

It could be a gel , it could be a micro capsule and there by you could provide them an environment which is very analogues to a living cell and then use them as immobilize preparations .	3.129123426543519

You can see that a large number of methods are available .	4.772735572577618

Under each category also there are number of methods and we need to choose a suitable method for a particular purpose .	3.9750026578588424

There are no general rules .	6.137845027409696

It often goes by trial and error and some available information .	2.9457963467563886

Out of the methods available , which we will discuss subsequently , if we have to choose an immobilization method to use for a specific application there are four distinct parameters which should be looked into .	3.1569925018865943

The first and probably the foremost is yield of immobilization .	3.2443072070009635

That means during immobilization procedure what is the loss of enzyme activity because there is no method which can give you hundred percent recovery of the enzyme activity that you have put into the system .	4.238715267642762

There will be some enzyme which will be deactivated or lost during the immobilization and the loss of enzyme activity has to be kept minimum for all practical purposes .	3.446149882800608

When you consider the yield of an immobilization , it is basically a term which can be considered on the basis of material balance .	4.57397877005359

This is the total picture of all the species that will be available and the loss of enzyme activity , soluble enzyme activity let us say as E0 , residual enzyme activity as Er and the immobilize enzyme activity as Ei , then the loss of enzyme activity is E0 - Er - Ei / E0 That is the loss or rather fractional loss of enzyme activity .	2.830487718610591

Of the total enzyme activity , the activity is distributed into two fractions - the immobilized enzyme as well as the uncoupled enzyme in the residue and these two theoretically should combine and form the total value of E0 but very often at the end of a method there is some balance left and the balance is the loss due to deactivation during immobilization .	2.8524051919863016

The yield of the immobilization is defined as r = Ei / E0 - Er Very often there is confusion in reporting these terms and that ’ s why I have tried to put them in the form of an expression .	2.887598052344863

While we talk of a yield we must keep into mind the residual activity in the supernatant .	3.3095501519669566

Its not in the total enzyme because part of the enzyme has been recovered in the supernatant which if desired can be recycled .	4.22090280878337

Therefore the yield will be the activity which is recovered in the immobilized form divided by E0 - Ei in the residue .	3.395124073632977

When you talk of Ei that is the activity of immobilized enzyme you are measuring in terms of the activity only .	5.410989574056429

So that means it is active .	6.8181830725157155

Right in the beginning I made it very clear that when we talk of quantification of enzyme it is just not a physical quantity like mass or concentration .	2.840084443658721

It is the functional property .	6.367028247361145

Its quantity is functional property and the activity represents functional activity .	3.4220604302980098

We are not measuring Ei in terms of protein contents .	4.993751295300569

I am measuring all these terms E0 , Er and Ei in terms of catalytic activity .	3.6471280963862345

So it is functional .	7.986527145428291

This loss , if it is a let us a physical quantity like protein concentration the balance will be perfect .	3.444443951761444

You cannot account for any loss of protein in the system .	4.014046866079002

It is only the loss of activity because of the conformational changes .	6.248092824896729

The other factor which is important to be considered is enzyme loading .	4.389280929830988

When we talk about specific activity higher the specific activity , enzyme is catalytically better .	3.3303360547958123

Similarly in case of enzyme loading we talk of international units per gram of carrier or if you take into account the bulk density of the carrier you can also say international units per ml of carrier bed that means you pack the carrier into a bed , packed bed , and then consider the volume .	3.1380194053425834

So enzyme loading is another factor and we want a preparation with as high loading as possible theoretically .	3.1398590128337194

The enzyme loading will also have a direct linkage with the mass transfer limitations .	4.107701690324594

We will see subsequently how mass transfer and catalytic activity are linked .	3.562639388469698

Then the third parameter which is important to look at is storage and operational stability .	4.249642758575193

As I mentioned that we have to look for enzyme and one of the major advantage of immobilized enzyme is that they can be reused , they can be repeatedly used , continuously used and therefore they must possess a much higher stability than the soluble enzyme .	3.9709668813483323

This stability is not only in terms of use but also during storage and this parameter is usually expressed in terms of half life .	3.5460809317179325

Either half life during storage that means the time in which the activity loses to fifty percent of the original activity or during use in a continuous reactor or in a batch reactor that is in terms of number of cycles .	3.9035671982012032

You can express in that term .	5.190443065664458

That will be only restricted when you are talking of a fibre or a surface .	4.414872315277995

The most commonly used matrices are beads - the spherical particles and that ’ s why gram or volume and they are packed in a packed bed .	3.0032610038562546

When I say per ml I am referring to a parameter which is analogues to use in a packed bed .	3.6901460616015207

But if you this in a surface , in fibre or in a film you can also express in terms of a surface area .	3.7173329943006084

That is always allowed .	8.46253857077368

But for all industrial application the surface excepting for biosensors and things like that which are very specific applications , for industrial catalysis it is used in the form of particles and used with the packed bed .	2.9686108858863665

We will discuss those aspects subsequently .	4.848562318224201

Iu / m2 also is a feasible parameter that we can define .	5.0427123553390825

For example in the case of adsorption you require a carrier .	4.771590023155096

If suppose you want to adsorb by ionic binding , you need a carrier which possesses charges .	3.8139289699585843

Similarly if you want a covalent binding you need a carrier which possesses certain functional residues which can be coupled to the enzyme .	3.906883439451241

So each method will have some limitations on the choice of carrier and therefore the cost of the carrier .	4.122358944126323

Another parameter which must be taken into account is regenerability .	4.099858987389123

Very often even after the immobilized enzyme preparation has been exhausted during use the carrier can be recovered and reused .	3.384866705877237

So the cost of the carrier must be taken into account in terms of per cycle not the absolute cost .	4.137808402150288

You must differentiate between the absolute cost and cost of the carrier per cycle .	3.7514945587846174

Because many of the carriers although expensive , can be used for a long period and in number of repeated cycles .	4.240156599288301

Therefore they are still acceptable and desirable because of other desirable property .	3.0446308904070136

The first and probably the simplest method of immobilization is by adsorption .	4.033312013532876

The adsorption method is a very broad , non - specific method and it involves binding of the enzyme to the surface of an insoluble carrier that has not been specifically functionalized for covalent coupling .	3.3166280990447823

I must mark here particularly the phrase “specifically functionalized for covalent coupling ” .	2.705374872025055

This probably gives you an idea that this is a very broad non - specific method .	5.180650232941954

If we consider all the carrier binding methods excluding those which involve covalent linkage , rest of all the bindings , interactions between the carrier and the enzyme are covered under the term called adsorption .	2.904118226252635

A very broad based method which involves a number of non - specific , multivariant , reversible interactions between the enzyme and the carrier at mild conditions .	3.388686292867999

The second point also builts in a number of phrases .	4.143466447880445

For example the interactions that are involved are non - specific , very often more than one interaction is involved in a particular method , multivariant that means more than one physical property is employed .	3.188251149032483

In most cases the methods based on adsorption are reversible in nature .	3.5081423779924283

That means under certain conditions while you can adsorb the enzyme on to a carrier you can also create condition by which you can desorb the enzyme .	2.9146345168647825

The basic property of this reversible interaction also makes it a weak binding .	3.2847526426453806

Weak binding in the sense while during use , the enzyme can also dissolve slowly over a long period of time and if the carrier characteristics are sturdy they can be regenerated and reused .	3.4628657561789993

Multivariant means that more than one physico - chemical interaction is involved in binding .	4.4341723520576535

Another feature is mild conditions and that will apply to most of the immobilization methods and also to adsorption .	4.163262599272937

That means the environmental conditions required for adsorption must be mild and here I think I like to very specifically define the term mild .	2.8158758317662573

Mild refers here not to the value one or two it refers to those conditions under which enzyme is conformationally stable .	3.2749792468962267

The definition of mild condition refers to those conditions which are environmentally acceptable to the enzyme .	3.1744748722703973

If the enzyme is stable at 70ºC , 70ºC is acceptable and can be considered as mild .	3.957212594645483

But if the enzyme is not stable even at 20ºC you may have to go to 4 degrees to immobilize and the definition of mild will remain at 4 degrees .	3.199654026508946

I have purposely not used the word ambient because you refer it to a well definite range .	2.739664737941106

The advantage of the situation is that usually the methods based on adsorption results in high yields .	3.578325939996644

A disadvantage is that the preparations do not have very high operational stability .	5.319054306819469

The method is reversible in nature , the interactions are reversible and so operational stability is usually not very high .	3.3110907375824294

Although by various other manipulations like adsorption , coupling with cross linking the operational stability can be improved but intrinsically adsorption based methods are usually operationally high .	2.3899841378442814

If suppose in the case of covalent binding half lives are of the order of few months here it may be of the order of few days .	3.5352816712595185

So that is what it refers to but allows the regeneration with carrier .	3.3415449060296534

On the other hand although the operational stability is not very high but the advantage is that the carrier can be regenerated and reused .	3.348001096144567

That is the plus point .	6.144972143900923

You have a large variety of carriers that can be used .	5.555943466128468

We will look at some of the examples of the carriers and finally adsorption based methods have been very often used to study the enzymology of systems that naturally occur in biological system because in case of living cells most of the enzymes are supported on a solid matrix through adsorption only .	3.013092232926181

There are no covalent linkages .	6.149321847209094

Either the enzymes are supported on membrane or they are supported on certain particulate matters and therefore the methods based on adsorption are usually very analogues similar to those that are found in the living system .	2.937707447555235

Operational stability is defined in terms of half life .	5.295364679070086

Consider the use of immobilized enzyme in a reactor and pack it in a packed bed , feed in and effluent out .	4.358044787172075

Here X - axis is operational time and Y - axis is fraction of conversion .	4.183540530074638

What you notice is that when you start at zero time the fraction of conversion will keep on going down as the enzyme activity is reduced or lost .	3.388427404423729

If you consider as a first order process then the half life of this that means the time it takes to reach the fifty percent of the original value is half life .	3.4527879111770203

If we consider E = E0 e - kdt You can simply calculate half life as t1 / 2 = 0.69 / kd t1 / 2 is less in the case of adsorption .	3.179451317242473

Other way , compared to covalent binding .	4.859940451976413

Right . Because the interaction is reversible in nature so it keeps leaking .	3.5647407653767567

A very crude term could be the enzyme keeps leaking values , very small amounts , slowly not in a very fast rate .	3.113339399799363

This property of leaking of the enzyme from immobilized preparation has been very advantageously used in many cases of the enzyme therapy purposes , where we want to put an immobilized enzyme preparation onsite at a site where the enzyme is required and the enzyme must leak continuously not in a very high concentration and over a long period of time .	3.5783315803081677

Some systems like immobilized …… .	8.328648499450821

has been inserted into the blood stream in the immobilized forms - microcapsules and the enzyme leaks slowly and the immobilized system can remain in blood stream over a few months .	3.1957190366312593

You have to give another shot to keep the enzyme activity available in the blood stream .	4.373916452572129

So these methods can have an advantage that the reversible nature can also be used in some cases where you want to use the drug or a therapeutic agent with the requirement of slow availability over a long period of time .	3.1574416985513065

As far as study of reactor system is concerned , we are not measuring the enzyme activity every time .	3.758576369645819

What we are measuring is the conversion at the effluent .	4.883260066558315

So that ’ s why the graph is in the form of conversion .	4.924172148379087

Three most common types of adsorption methods are based on physical adsorption which is again a most non - specific type of adsorption where we use hydrogen bonding , electrostatic interactions or Vanderwaal interactions , a variety of interactions where there is no specific reasons and we use a very broad range of carriers like alumina , celite , bentonite , glass etc where which by certain conditions of pH , temperature and salt you can adsorb the enzyme on to the surface and they can be used .	2.4318810377777806

The second method is ionic binding where you take a tailored matrix which has a definite charge on the surface and ion exchange resins are the most commonly used matrices .	3.641759214212704

DEAE - Cellulose , Amberlite etc which are charged particles and these charged particles based on the electrostatic interaction can bind the enzyme molecules at a pH where the net charge is counter .	2.910375816852987

The enzyme at this stage is counter charged at a particular condition .	4.083557660766158

The third category is hydrophobic binding where we predominantly use hydrophobic interactions on the surface of the carrier and the hydrophobic interactions on the surface of the enzyme protein .	2.9583472401113977

Although bulk of the hydrophobic residues are buried inside the residue of enzyme but still on the surface there are very small hydrophobic patches which can be used here for immobilizing on to the surface of a hydrophobic carrier ; carriers like polypropylene beads .	3.0139621221206623

There is a commercial product by the name Accurel , which is a microporous carrier consisting of polypropylene , butyl or hexyl sepharose etc .	2.4848278679486793

There are number of hydrophobic carriers used and which are available for binding of enzyme .	3.8880453226132543

Many of the carriers which are available today for adsorption of enzymes are developed for chromatographic separations .	3.371016670393027

For example all the carriers like hydrophobic binding or ionic binding were originally developed for chromatographic separations where the function is same .	2.5032982358010227

That means you are binding through ionic interactions and desorbing it under the conditions of desorption and therefore the same thing applies here .	2.990002347248212

In fact the preparation of immobilized enzyme by adsorption is very much similar to chromatographic separations on ion exchange resin , although we are only interested in the first part of it .	3.3573097724140757

Only adsorption part ; desorption is not our interest where as in the case of chromatography both the parts are important .	2.938468401272685

Another important group of adsorption methods is metal salt linkage .	3.544383645121233

Certain metal salts like titanium tetra chloride and ferric chloride form a kind of an inorganic bridge on the surface of the carrier and to which the enzyme molecules can couple .	3.303981515972475

The linkage that is formed , what we have in the literature and what people have used , is the metal salt linkage .	3.3837120644178325

It is not a covalent linkage ; it is a physical interaction and there by the enzyme is held but has been very successful method from the practical point of view .	3.6060674121296747

We will discuss that in detail .	5.833168756698502

Most of the adsorption methods can be characterized by the classical adsorption isotherms .	3.317110974794391

Depending on the nature of the carrier and nature of the enzyme that we are talking about , the isotherms may vary .	5.188698175711476

Three general types of isotherms are known .	4.753973235640771

One is linear where q is the concentration of the enzyme protein on to the surface of the carrier ; y is the corresponding concentration in the solution at equilibrium .	4.208662483825522

If you take a combination of enzyme in carrier concentration and at equilibrium measure the concentration in the solid phase and the liquid and you make an isotherm , then you may end up sometime in some cases a linear relationship where q is equal to k.y To make the isotherm , take different ratios of the carrier and the enzyme activity .	3.0554984424457197

That means enzyme activity to carrier ratio is varied and at different combinations you allow equilibrium to be formed and under equilibrium condition you measure the concentration of the enzyme in the liquid phase and also in the solid phase .	3.0391633041101658

Each point represents a particular enzyme to carrier ratio .	5.156616286939999

You can find three different types of isotherms : linear is simple ; Freundlich is more general in the sense that it does not fit into any hypothesis but in general you can vary curve fitting .	2.8718088920792977

What ever kind of isotherm you get , you just raise to a factor of n and by analysis of your data you will calculate the value of k and n .	2.710026180476496

You could make a log log plot and you can get the value of k and n .	4.0885852623011685

The most established and analytically proven method is Langmuir isotherm .	3.0802330496657055

Here q is the concentration of the enzyme protein on to the solid matrix and q0 is the maximum capacity of the matrix .	4.44430141039073

If you take a very high enzyme concentration compared to carrier , allow equilibrium to be established that means the concentration of the enzyme on to the immobilized preparation which will represent the saturation behavior is q0 .	3.427895180455732

You will notice that it is analogues to your Michaelis Menten kinetics .	4.876465003823105

These three expressions the Langmuir isotherm , Michaelis Menten kinetics , hyperbolic expression and also the Mannose equation for cell growth are almost analogues expressions and that indicates that there is some inter relationship or some similarity in their basic physical interpretation .	2.596172285470124

Langmuir isotherm is based on a theoretical development .	6.257831546605961

One can develop on the basis of number of binding sites on the carrier molecule for enzyme .	4.4188294130462955

Here just like we consider the enzyme substrate binding where the enzyme acts as the carrier and the substrate is ligand here the carrier will be the matrix and the protein will be the ligand and on those conditions you can develop it or you can analyze it by a double reciprocal plot .	3.76182496878423

The analogy is that the three expressions , the Langmuir adsorption isotherm , the Michaelis Menten kinetics and Mannose kinetics for cell growth they are analogues terms .	2.85933599420492

In the case of enzyme we are talking of enzyme substrate complex formation .	5.291454111062898

That means enzyme is the matrix , surface is a ligand .	5.258672060914586

If we talk in terms of adsorption , the substrate gets adsorbed on to the enzyme surface .	5.390650234526985

On the other hand here in the case of adsorption the enzyme is itself a ligand and the matrix or the carrier is the surface on which the ligand adsorbs .	3.560748427550017

In the third case , in the case of cell growth , the Mannose model of microbial cell growth it is a substrate which is a ligand just like enzymes but the matrix is the cell mass itself and it reflects the transport of substrate into the cell .	3.1288871832801903

So this is adsorption that is transport and enzyme catalyses enzyme substrate binding .	2.8472486082754087

So these three phenomena are intrinsically someway related because they end up in a similar kind of a kinetic expression .	3.2583712083746232

As far as the analysis is concerned all the three can also be analyzed by a double reciprocal plot .	3.7938993649597674

That is if you plot 1 / q versus 1 / y you will get a linear plot and you will get the value of q0 and k .	4.598115666184484

The adsorption process for a particular enzyme and for a particular carrier can be analyzed quantitatively .	5.193101795547182

Many physical factors influence the adsorption process .	4.912225250088202

I have listed some of them here .	6.608958517395832

The first parameter is pH .	6.669154687498708

The pH will be a very major parameter which will affect the binding in the case of ionic binding .	5.0950903930856475

Even for other forms of binding processes pH plays a key role and very often it has been noted that the binding by adsorption is maximum at its isoelectric points .	2.9308514383736286

Large variety of relationships with respect to pH for the quantity adsorbed has been found .	3.482892151551217

There is no general ruling but in general or a common feature can be considered that at the isoelectric point the pH value will be most preferable for the adsorption processes .	2.816689323616414

No . Net charge is zero .	6.273517457166829

It is not that the proteins are not charged at that pH .	3.8873790139275783

The negative and positive charges are equal .	4.891941731039635

Not that there is no charge .	9.891603041523384

The second parameter is salts .	6.006271212496867

Salts have a very complex behavior .	10.226812459440259

In fact it has almost opposite behavior .	4.10300010127795

You must have studied also in the case of bio separations particularly the concentration of salt is used for increasing as well as decreasing solubility .	4.103933605341143

But in most cases the salt concentration is required to be kept at a minimum because salts are very good eluents also .	2.90503317451829

In ion exchange chromatography very often we use high ionic strength as a medium for elution of the adsorbed material .	2.5799697356700904

Therefore at high salt concentration adsorption is usually poor and minimum salt concentration is required to be kept .	2.810812264648615

Protein concentration will be important and we have seen from the adsorption isotherm itself .	4.747929969452432

The definite ratio of protein to carrier will play a particular equilibrium behavior and higher the protein concentration you can reach nearer the saturation level at equilibrium .	2.8247102305768625

Temperature again is a very significant parameter which must be understood .	5.598106517628046

If we look at adsorption of a small molecular weight material or a small molecular weight ligands on to a surface the general behavior is that increasing the temperature reduces the adsorption .	3.298478888939942

That means the quantity of ligand adsorbed per unit weight of the carrier for low molecular weight ligands will be less as you increase the temperature and the reason attributed to this is because of the movement of the particles as the temperature increases .	3.8474061824901153

That means the movement of particle increases and the tendency is for desorbing rather than adsorption .	2.8660342174463995

But in the case of protein adsorption when we are talking about enzymes , we are talking about proteins and macromolecules , adsorption over a narrow range of temperature offers a reverse phenomena .	3.1193381142538037

That means adsorption increases with temperature .	4.826361832096054

Mind the word I am using “over a narrow range of temperature increase ” .	3.459700877516636

If you increase to a higher level desorption also might start .	3.425712251139017

But before desorption even inactivation might start .	4.00388749867261

But we consider the adsorption at …… range of temperature .	5.4446030984815055

The primary factors responsible for the increase in adsorption with temperature are when the protein binds to a surface there is some unfolding of the protein molecules , which is an endothermic process and the increase of temperature resulting in enhanced adsorption supports the hypothesis that the binding or adsorption of a protein molecule or a polymeric material to a surface is an endothermic process coupled with unfolding of the confirmation .	2.8460409928589536

When I say unfolding I am not referring to total deactivation but minor modification in the conformation which extends its total volume or total surface area .	2.5222113472880423

The other factor which is important , which is probably attributing to this increase of adsorption with the increase in temperature is the diffusional processes because most of time we are talking about the carrier being a porous material and the ligands or the protein here have to diffuse into the surface , into the internal pore surface and the diffusion process gets increased by increase in temperature .	2.607219619331425

So both the unfolding of the protein molecule on the surface of the carrier and the diffusional processes involved in the adsorption in the internal pores ultimately leads to give you a phenomenon which represents increase in adsorption with increase in temperature over a narrow range .	3.09656841210781

Carrier properties , depending on the property like surface property of the carrier particles which were used as matrix , will also play a role on the adsorption behaviour depending on the nature may be sometime even the carriers are pre - conditioned , swollen to improve the property .	2.829743537058257

Time of adsorption is another parameter which is significant and important because we are talking about the macromolecular adsorption .	3.763891285463316

So the diffusion is involved and the time required very often is controlled by diffusional limitations and the rate of diffusion controls the time required for adsorption process .	3.5038394603328116

This in the case of a small ligand is not a constant .	6.325927602467145

At least four major methods are used for adsorption .	5.229366837028064

The first and probably the most trivial method is the static process .	3.1296327607505745

That means you bring in an enzyme solution in contact with a carrier and leave it over night or over a long period of time .	2.761624478926699

Adsorption takes place without any hesitation .	5.597866199863403

It takes a very long time and that is the process very often many people use in laboratories .	4.200860880915269

The yields are also much lower particularly for porous carrier because of the diffusional limitations .	3.725855579323082

One of the most disadvantageous situations in the case of static process is that the loading of the enzyme is not uniform over the carrier .	4.400375331956031

Even if you allow for a long period the loading is usually not uniform .	3.9453111166178587

Suppose this is the carrier particle .	12.57156599384101

You have lot of enzyme molecules on the surface but on the interior it is very , very rarely distributed and the loading is not uniform .	3.811476586360687

The most commonly used method in the laboratories is dynamic batch process in which you mix the two components , the enzyme and the carrier under known conditions or under standard conditions for adsorption , which favours adsorption and agitate them , stir them mechanically , under mild stirring so that the carrier particle should not get degraded and also the enzyme molecules should not be influenced .	2.7262604076371137

The equilibrium is allowed to be reached over a period of time .	3.3375715780330513

It usually leads to a fast method and most common method used in the laboratories .	3.9494226547990126

In the commercial establishment when we use adsorption as the method of immobilization we use reactor loading process .	3.2146399672026633

That means first of all the reactor which is to be used for bio - conversion of the enzymatic reaction is packed with the carrier itself and then the enzyme solution is recirculated constantly through the carrier bed and over a period of time the enzyme gets adsorbed on the matrix .	3.26179372833253

It could not only be packed bed ; it could also be stirred reactor in which the enzyme is added and the enzyme solution is allowed to be stirred along with the carrier and after a period of time when the supernatant enzyme activity has come to minimum value you stop the process .	3.2669125108920913

In all these methods which we are talking about , the final step is washing because very often you will have that some of the enzyme will be adhering to the surface of the particles which is not really immobilized in the proper sense .	3.8298067522068426

It is not adsorbed ; some adhering along with the liquid and so fresh wash of the buffer at a particular pH should be given so that all the adhering enzyme is washed out and only that which is physically bound by adsorption is retained by the carrier .	2.5137793156577373

The final washing in the case of reactor loading process is done with the substrate solution itself because during the operation it has to meet the environmental conditions which are provided by the substrate solution , the feed .	3.4193353213428086

Under those conditions it must remain adsorbed and so the final washing in the case of a reactor loading method is provided by the feed substrate itself so that whatever desorption has to take place under feed substrate condition , takes place and the enzyme is in the stable form .	3.0539779042069806

The fourth method is electrodeposition process in which the carrier is placed in proximity to one of the electrodes and the current is applied between the two electrodes and the enzyme particles which are charged usually they get deposited on the carrier particles and at the end the carrier is removed which gets coated by the enzyme particle .	3.617474561724852

One thing we have to keep in mind , a very important feature that during the electro chemical process there will be certain ions which will be removed from the electrodes or from the process .	3.605799839548897

If the ions are important for enzyme activity then they must be provided in the electrolyte itself .	3.3351972851374225

Extra quantity of those will be provided in the electrolyte otherwise you will not be having a functional enzyme preparation in the immobilized form .	3.1658844103956625

The last method based on the adsorption process is by inorganic bridge formation as I mentioned or metal salt linkage .	3.507443677847376

This was originally developed by British group Barker , Emery and Novais , one of the references I have sited here , in seventy one .	2.570209105132199

It involves the metal salt linkage .	5.298500056936243

The basic principle of the method is the method employs transition metal salts like titanium tetrachloride , zirconium tetrachloride or ferric chloride for linking an enzyme to the carrier .	2.6452252143763983

Carriers are usually cellulose , nylon , glass beads etc .	3.7535646098319284

If you put cellulose into it , it might get degraded totally .	3.2949038526304193

So the time of contact is very important and it is not used mostly more than five minutes and if you take a dilute solution probably you can go higher , followed by filtering and drying of complex at 45ºC .	3.353151331368076

Excess unreacted salt is washed with buffer .	4.2484977978942675

The activated carrier is then stirred with the buffered enzyme solution followed by washing of the unbound enzyme .	2.3414375028686494

The method is very simple and involves two steps , activation of the matrix by steeping it in a transition metal salt solution whereby the transition metal salts form an octahedral complex .	2.927465901834336

The chemistry of that can be considered like this .	6.55122948362655

Titanium tetra chloride will exist in different forms and the complexes will be either dominated by water molecules as the ligand in the octahedral complex form .	2.539407791874403

The titanium tetra chloride solution will exist in different forms complexed with certain ligands .	3.10936061526913

For example in solution water molecule will be present as the ligand and will complex with water and chloride ions .	3.0473553501976918

In aqueous form titanium has five water molecules and one chloride .	3.071147824605315

It can also exist as the chloro complex ; five chloride ions and one water molecules .	2.548747603490015

It can also exist as total chloride ions in the case of a co - ordination complex .	3.6079152093751325

So when this solution is brought in contact with the matrix , any carbohydrate matrix , cellulose has been a very commonly used matrix , then what happens is that these ligands are replaced by the hydroxyl groups present on the carbohydrate molecule .	2.74631350247559

The ligand particularly the water molecules which are present here are replaced by the hydroxyl groups present on the carbohydrate molecule and you make a network , titanium treated cellulose which is complexed along with the length of the chain on the carbohydrate is formed .	3.1101802670553704

When this activated matrix , we consider this as an activated complex , is further brought into contact with the protein or enzyme again some of the water molecules are replaced by the functional groups on the enzyme .	3.3445837484368335

Wherever you see water molecules , for example these ones they may be replaced by enzyme molecules .	3.3730093117858866

Wherever hydroxyl groups are present they can replace part of them and what ends up is a matrix which has a coordination link of titanium tetra chloride salt along with the enzyme molecule .	2.849290523629926

One of the major advantages is that you always end up having a distance between the carrier surface and the enzyme molecules .	3.8514086697592136

Therefore enzyme molecules and the carrier surface are separated by these linkages , the metal salt linkages .	3.8761228027790158

That provides you a very big advantage of removing the steric hindrance .	3.924401075988583

Many of the enzymes when they are coupled to a solid matrix may not be able to interact with the substrate because of steric hindrance .	4.020744046858641

But in this case because there is distance between the matrix surface and the enzyme , steric hindrance is minimized .	4.808169441284338

The second major advantage which has been noted in these cases is that if you use a regenerated carrier after the enzyme has been leached out , you again immobilize the enzyme on the regenerated carrier .	3.164316128532385

It gives you a much increased activity and that is the major advantage .	6.028970905259696

The major reason has been that the distance from surface has increased .	3.551742892918414

So steric hindrances are further decreased and therefore particularly with those enzymes which are known to have steric hindrances during immobilization , the ones which use much larger polymers as the substrate , for those systems the method is very significant .	2.6148681193301058

So these are the various methods that we have discussed today .	5.291829271355668

The various methods that involve the coupling of enzyme by adsorption to a matrix and their characteristic features and as I mentioned that the immobilization methods must be evaluated on the basis of their yield , operational stability and carrier regenerability .	2.8662840018871525

We stop here .	13.651347239621236

Welcome back to this course in Polymer Chemistry .	3.1606825266091074

And in this lecture we will continue our discussion on Polymer Stereochemistry and Coordination Polymers , which we began in the last lecture .	2.584176628567425

Now , in last lecture we had discussed this page , and remember we discussed this that if this active chain end in a propagating chain , polymer chain , if this carbon is radical or it is a anion or cation with a counter ion which is not strongly binded .	3.4941481916865325

If the counter ion for anionic or cationic case they are free , then what happens ?	4.317446072253615

This carbon atom is a planar molecule and then when you , when the next monomer approach , it can approach from either side .	3.167088384830267

So , the configuration of this carbon is determined by the configuration of the penultimate carbon with this case , this carbon .	3.7782197997908566

And obviously it is always preferred that this bulky group will be or the group substitution group will be the other side of the R group which is in the , in this penultimate carbon ; which means syndiotactic polymers will be always preferred ; syndiotactic addition will always be preferred than a isotactic addition .	3.295710303962799

And these preferences will always go up if you increase the temperature .	3.757997559418526

Now , how to synthesize a highly isotactic ?	5.999764697650267

And we also said that if we increase the temperature , obviously the tendency for syndiotactic and isotactic will be significant .	3.7340103549038437

So , we will be going to get a atactic polymer at higher temperature .	5.10756116287116

So , basically we know how to get a syndiotactic polymer and we know how to get a atactic polymer .	4.523947421902766

So , how to get a highly isotactic polymers ?	5.779260610774691

Now , we can get a highly isotactic polymers if we do a ionic polymerization such that , we have a very strong coordination between the counter ion , the monomer , the incoming monomer and the active chain and which could be a cation or an anion .	3.9272819132329126

So , if I carry out a ionic polymerization where we have a strong coordination between the counter ion with the cationic or anionic chain end and the incoming monomer , then the approach will be from , always from the same side of the same side , so you will get a isotactic polymerization .	3.475085111658442

Now , how do you get or create a condition where this thing , this coordination , strong coordination between the active chain end , the monomer and counter ion happen ?	2.9833281788887094

Now , if we have a monomer which have a polar group as a , in the substituents like , say you have a methyl chlorate or ethyl group in the backbone , where this is a polar molecule .	3.932612316641874

So , this can actually coordinate with a with a cation in this case .	3.4742853728477323

Now it is said that , if the monomers or if the chain end , the active chain end whether it is a cation or anion , if they are free with the with the counter ion and the active chain end , if they are free , then we have seen what are the types of stereochemistry we are going to get .	4.006717223129533

Now , how can we make sure that this counter ion and the active chain end are tightly bound ?	3.221307783923752

If you can carry out the reaction in a very nonpolar medium like hydrocarbon , and if we have a counter ion which is small in size , so that they will be tightly bound .	4.042568452037264

For example , like Lithium .	7.7290577382272705

And if we can carry out this reaction at low temperature , what happen ?	4.976785571854144

Then we can get coordination ; strong coordination between monomers and the incoming the active chain end and the counter ion .	4.004659446536044

Now , let us take an example of methyl methacrylate .	4.177019315703499

If we do the reaction , if we take the methyl methacrylate and do the reaction with a anionic initiator , say for example , butyl lithium in say toluene at a lower temperature .	4.2429060671254755

So , if we consider say n butyl lithium as a initiator and toluene as your medium , nonpolar medium and set minus 78 degree temperature .	2.4088688477709717

So , this condition will satisfy that the carbon ion chain end and the lithium counter ion are tightly bound , strongly bound each other .	2.7636044664094963

And if that is the case , then you can imagine the situation like this ; where because of resonance , these ionic charges are distributed can in the three atom .	3.728907147622431

Now if such thing happens , then what happened ?	4.083282112250203

So the new monomer , the incoming monomer can approach from only one single side .	3.785933826221657

So , there is a loose cyclic intermediate formation and one side is blocked by lithium .	3.038887903444708

So , monomer can approach ; the incoming monomer can approach only from a single side and always producing an isotactic polymer .	3.0731209183128065

So you , if you do this reaction in lower temperature , nonpolar medium with a lithium plus type small counter ion , you can get highly isotactic polymers .	3.118123336355823

Now , if you can do the same thing with isobutyl vinyl ether and make a cationic polymerization with say B F 3 H 2 O B F 3 , and H 2 O type initiator , then you have a cationic group , and again now an anionic counter ion which are tightly bound ; because you are carrying out .	2.893053988199126

This is a nonpolar medium .	6.311715028504841

Again you can think of a similar MMA type situation , where in this case the counter ion is actually giving a strong coordination between the… this is monomer substituent and the incoming monomer forming this type of intermediates .	3.2551339448951757

And again all the sides is blocked .	4.436899791743668

So the monomer , incoming monomer can add to the chain from only single side .	3.6879797862001404

And you can get a isotactic polymer always .	7.651375004703087

So , if we look at some data ; let us consider methyl methacrylate as a… This is a normal butyl lithium in toluene at minus 80 degrees 78 degree centigrade .	3.0176756773071105

That is the example I gave in the last page that produce isotactic poly methyl methacrylate .	3.692078469373197

Look , if we have the same polymerization , same temperature , same initiator , but if you increase the polarity of the medium , obviously if you increase the polarity of the medium , T H F is highly polar solvent .	3.332381836519094

So , the counter ion is not tightly bound ; so strongly bound with the active anion end .	3.242259623203336

They are free they are free ion ; the lithium ion is a free ion , which means the chain end has a planar geometry .	3.670157912236807

Now , if you increase the temperature it will be the same reaction with butyl lithium in T H F .	4.926083085400079

And do it in a much higher temperature , then you are going to get a mixture of isotactic and syndiotactic component .	4.856463294871147

In the polymers , you are going to get a atactic polymerization .	5.417379346703836

This is the example of cationic polymerization which has B F 3 threat in propane as minus 60 degree centigrade .	3.0606583581434497

That is the example ; cationic example just gave and which gives you a isotactic polymer .	4.1970844017592235

So , what we know that that radical polymerization will always give preferably syndiotactic syndiotactic polymers .	3.6035854758907235

And this do not get dominated if you increase decrease the temperature .	4.723371620068431

Now if you , for ionic polymerization if we do polymerization in condition where the ionic chain end and counter ion they are present as the free ion , then they will be … as a radical polymerization. .. And , if we do the reaction in conditions so that , the counter ion is strongly bound with the active chain end , then what happened ?	3.4745968961547744

That , which we get , if we do reaction in the nonpolar medium at low temperature and with a , as a small counter ion , then there will be a possibility of a strong coordination between the monomer and the active chain end and the counter ion ; which will makes sure that the monomer , the incoming monomer gets into the chain from one side and which will produce a isotactic polymerization , isotactic polymers .	3.194515210194467

So , I know ; we know , what are the strategies ?	6.2914801463715735

We should do to synthesize isotactic , syndiotactic and atactic polymerization .	3.409524727873695

Now , let us see how do you analyze how do you analyze these polymers .	4.175987240595261

Now , let us consider a simple molecule ; again same thing .	3.4848910138068305

Now , if we write two pair ; two asymmetric pair of carbon atom , now this is the horizontal line .	3.7671215629321235

This is your polymer backbone backbone .	6.034933084963907

And this line gives you the configuration of the carbon atom .	5.302856291949601

So this , in this case both the carbon atom , the asymmetric carbon atom has same configuration .	4.219719080884802

So , we call this as a mesodyad .	6.2161986649197445

And if they are in opposite direction , then we call this is as a racimic dyad .	4.35151227395871

We write m ; we write r for this .	4.138464411072077

Now dyad tacticity ; this term dyad tacticity is defined as the fraction of pair of fraction of pairs ; these are pairs , this is another pair ; so fraction of pairs of adjacent repeat unit are in a particular Stereochemistry , say isotactic or syndiotactic .	2.547449416504369

So , if we write m ; m is the fraction of pair adjacent repeat units that are present in a isotactic geometry .	4.075353905637685

And of course , n plus r would be equals to 1 .	3.9497280824091137

Now , sometimes few people write this is as a meso gives you isotactic , so they write as a ‘ i ’ , and the which gives a syndiotactic as small ‘ s ’ as well .	2.432604383745791

Now , we also can imagine Tryads .	5.9295249603148

So , which actually gives you isotactic polymers and we write this as m m ; so meso pair and another meso pair .	3.360835463622805

So , what will be ?	8.82819093060994

This is a racimic pair , this is also another racimic pair ; so gives you r r .	3.0706923120102965

and this gives you a syndiotactic rearrangement .	9.108877747856576

Now , in this case you have another possibility where you have a meso dyad ; another is a racimic dyad .	3.9683575595096503

So , you can have a meso , m r ; which gives you a heterotactic or atactic stereo arrangement .	3.7560071122679193

Again , we define in a similar way ; m m is a fraction of these three and r r is fraction of syndiotactic tryad and m r is a fraction of heterotactic tryad .	3.0513784479875077

So , we can write m m plus r r plus m r is equal to again 1 .	4.053349672616201

And sometimes , some people write this is this gives you isotactic , so they write I ; they gives you syndiotactic , so they write S and this is heterotactic , they write H .	3.2543344988387357

You can do yourself ; plus 0.5 m r and r as r r plus 0.5 m r .	3.8197328738538205

Now for isotactic or atactic polymer , both fractions for r will be equals to half .	3.224606537375685

So , half of the dyads will be in racimic form .	4.887464031757746

So , basically it is a fifty - fifty mixture of isotactic polymers , dyads and racimic dyads ; which is a completely atactic polymer .	3.7033677521555295

If you have an isotactic polymer , them m and m m , both the dyad and tryad would be equals to 1 .	2.5598629567790474

And if it is syndiotactic , then r and r r also will be 1 .	4.662384401060705

Now in case of atactic you also can you can also write m m and r r is one fourth ; whereas m r , if you have this fifty fifty , then obviously this m r , the combination of m and r tryad will be half .	3.188006449609404

So , you can write this .	7.5860771946032415

So , what we can do ?	7.296601609645717

We can identify this m and r from spectroscopic techniques like m m r .	3.156402917899731

We can use m m r techniques to find out the fraction of m , r or m r in the… All this we can find out quantitably from m m r experiment .	3.0600623460349037

And if we can find out this , we will be able to determine what is the extent of isotacticity , and syndiotacticity in the polymer .	4.652993028444325

If m is greater than one fourth , so as the m m tryad ; then obviously , it is predominantly towards this giving going towards a isotactic .	2.769652328395458

It is more isotactic , rather than syndiotactic .	4.271443189111037

If r is greater than 0.25 and r r greater than one fourth , then it is towards a syndiotactic .	4.087160401467329

That you can , yourself , this is what happened .	6.382178998833881

If there is a mixture it is always a isotactic polymerization .	6.688866776518055

So , these are the… So we can , what we can do ?	5.7200211491358965

We can take the polymer which is synthesized and get a quantitative m m r done .	4.73917883176552

This we can get .	14.374781797316382

And from that , the values for individual values we can actually estimate or we can predict or we can quantitatively get the amount of say tacticity ; which is the r fraction , which is the m fraction in the polymer itself .	3.971406297824347

Now , what we will do it ?	5.710216331826485

It will go and move to the next topic of Ziegler - Natta polymerization or coordination polymerization .	3.1316751287694706

Say for example , R 3 A l at high temperature high temperature plus high pressure , you only can got Oligomers ; so oligopoly ethylene or oligo ethylenes ; the maximum molecular of , maximum M W of around five thousand .	1.995124935402924

So , he was carrying out a polymerization reaction of ethylene in presence of a alkyl aluminum , Trialkyl aluminium and at high temperature and high pressure you only got oligomeric species , not a polymeric species .	2.823476193415934

What happened ?	23.096348722631518

When he added with this alkyl aluminum plus some transition metal compounds ?	3.3040180859908044

When he added , then even at low temperature , say like low temperature means 50 to 100 degree centigrade and at low pressure , he got very high molecular weight polyethylene .	3.2388817027650822

It is only the change of addition of transition metal compounds along with this alkyl aluminum .	3.9637874234403245

Then , it was dramatically… The polymerization nature was dramatically changed .	3.122435537947107

Now , this polyethylene is not branched like the polyethylene .	3.76744334981144

We discussed , while discussing the radical polymerization that , in case of radical polymerization you get a polyethylenes , which are branched because of chain transfer to polymers .	4.274830641539597

As we discussed , we recall from our discussion of chain transfer on radical polymerization .	4.201247750610557

In this case they are not branched ; they are linear high molecular polyethylene and that can be achieved even at low temperature , which is very means achievable or very comfortable temperature 50 degree to 100 degree centigrade , and even normal to low temperature , low pressure .	3.0971516350024

Now what happened ?	8.798031195811808

The same sort of catalyst was used by Natta .	4.0594181901869035

He was from Italy .	7.812804414585942

What if… he used instead of ethylene , he has taken say alpha or say in this case propylene and used the same sort of catalyst ; alkyl aluminum plus transition metal compounds .	2.4972297633136478

Now , what he got ?	8.279427249972272

He got high molecular weight polypropylene , definitely .	6.781209005279797

In addition , what he found that that was very stereo regular , stereo selective .	3.050379025096862

Depending up on exact polymeric conversion , it could be a completely isotactic or syndiotactic depending up on the exact condition .	3.3043540688443396

But what he found that it not only gives high molecular weight polypropylene , but it also gives a very high stereo selectivity ; whether it is a isotactic , completely isotactic or syndiotactic .	3.324240709510406

Now these two discoveries has a tremendous effect in Polymer Science .	2.988906297524434

And even at nowadays , say more than thirty to forty percent of the carbon carbon , the polymers which are made from carbon carbon double bond , polymers which are made from carbon carbon double bonds , they are synthesized by these coordination polymerization technique .	2.733361092184807

See , imagine how , what is the tremendous effect it has this discovery by Ziegler and Natta has made ; a huge huge importance in Polymer Chemistry , which has given recognition to them in 1963 .	2.415390755572769

Now , later on the large number of catalyst was discovered , developed .	4.382864245248668

And basically what happens ?	8.439145585201912

In… basically it is the combination of again the similar type of compounds and there has been a lot of research happened in this field .	3.563740908598986

And , most cases are organometallic compounds ; so organometallic compounds or hydride of a group one to three metal plus a halide or other compounds or other derivatives of group four to eight transition metals .	2.0690276829691783

So , basically this are the… this is , this they would take one from here and one from here and constitute the catalyst , which is generally called Ziegler - Natta initiator or Ziegler - Natta catalyst .	2.9201388797961845

For example , we can choose ; from this set , we can choose say triethyl aluminum or tri diethyl aluminum chloride or diethyl zinc , and from this we can say titanium , titanium chloride , tetrachloride , trichloride .	2.5273298465935135

And we can use so many things and these mixtures take one from here and one from here and constitute the Ziegler - Natta initiators .	2.8437384917291806

Where , instead of transition metal catalyst , metallocenes are used as a catalyst along with a co - initiator ; which we will discuss in a minute .	3.58880240435488

Now , most of the examples of Ziegler - Natta catalyst , let us put this Z - N , are titanium , from these two the titanium trichloride or 2 A l Cl or say titanium chloride plus… Most of the important industrial polymers are made from this .	3.063906106253353

And , this is the original polymer catalyst combination used by Ziegler .	4.019492721973366

And what happened when these things are mixed , Ti Cl 4 and triethyl aluminum ?	2.9906895338542117

They have taken in a nonpolar solvent and they have mixed ; now it produces a titanium trichloride and this .	2.978423253448251

Now , that this particular catalyst form - beta form of titanium trichloride does not have very high selectivity .	3.1956502037047465

What Natta found that , instead of using beta , other forms of titanium chloride like alpha or delta or gamma form of titanium trichloride ; if you use this sort of trichloride , then you get a very high stereospecificity , very high amount of isotacticity in this case .	2.857270320129209

Now , what happened ?	8.798031195811808

These two are , generally when the polymerization made these two polymers are mixed and ball milled that will mechanically grinded so that , that also increases the surface area of this catalyst .	2.494298348567536

Sometimes giving the development of the catalyst this titanium trichloride or tetrachloride , they are used along with a support like say magnesium chloride , where this titanium compound is either coherently bonded or they are occupied a crystal position in the lattice of the magnesium chloride support .	2.3770012539347922

So , that actually helps the activity and the stereo specificity .	3.843092758707736

And sometimes with this sort of Trialkyl aluminium chloride or say dialkyl aluminum chloride , sometimes these electron donors are added .	2.4842148147543037

Electron donors , like Lewis acids are added to increase the reactivity and the specificity stereo specificity of the catalyst .	3.5696493694375717

Typically , the activity of the catalyst is measured as a k g ; k g of polymer produced per gram of catalyst in an hour or completely or at the end of the or at end of the your or for a complete polymerization .	3.022029241658692

So , the activity of the catalyst is defined as the k g of polymers per gram of the catalyst used ; we can use in other , per hour or at the end of the polymerization .	3.4785033878210583

Now most cases , this type of the combination is your transitional metal compounds and alkyl aluminum compounds .	3.4983642097316583

They produce completely isotactic polymers except few cases ; where there are few exceptions like vanadium chloride plus trialkyl compound , which gives syndiotactic .	2.589627665633066

These are exception ; few exceptions , rather than a regular case .	3.6509023926606634

Most cases , in almost exclusively all the cases it is the isotactic , which get formed .	4.087976365756329

Now , what is the mechanism what is the mechanism by which these polymerization happen and all the stereostacticity is maintained ?	4.157926186373829

There has been lot of studies and lot of mechanism proposed during last several decades .	2.6390724031504043

And till there is no mechanism , you know , which has been which has been accepted by all the Chemists , Scientists working in this field .	3.6679292848933844

And , so what happened ?	9.471262440833033

Still this is , this Zeigler - Natta polymerization is not completely understood .	5.775433384646531

So , what we will discuss here in this lecture , we will basically talk about two mechanisms .	4.986482224843428

One was proposed originally by Natta and which is a bimetallic mechanism .	4.39428810960656

And second , where majority of has actually accepted this mechanism which is a monometallic .	3.6571359521174283

We will discuss these two in a minute .	4.439591171849075

Now , let us talk about first the bimetallic mechanism .	3.3281384428938443

I mean , this case the active side is an electron deficient .	5.183728953842163

The active side is electron deficient , bridged complex formed by chemisorption of the alkyl aluminum ; the electropositive alkyl , metal alkyl with a small ionic radius on the co - catalyst surface .	2.319964203304076

Let us first draw .	7.708022501100772

And this is the active side which is electron deficient than that formed by the chemisorption of the electropositive metal alkyl , which has a small ionic radius on the surface of the co - catalyst .	3.3621258730155548

Now , once this is formed which is electron deficient , what happened ?	4.584110682666845

The monomer approaches this active side and coordinates .	3.9413617679889823

So , we can write the next step .	6.081985792482285

Now instead of R , we are writing a propagating chain because that is the that is the steps get repeated .	4.792259652239913

So , we are not writing the first step , first addition .	4.71877265692473

We are writing any general addition of the next monomer , where P E is the polymer residue .	4.045122659290092

And , what happened ?	10.896466485215242

First , the monomer formation of complex between , formation of pi complex between the , with the nucleophilic olefin… So , they and this is electro deficient .	2.8289909261136934

So , this approaches and forms a pi complex with the titanium center and which gives you… Then , next what happened ?	2.977816416499715

This is followed by partial ionization of this olefin as well as this alkyl bridge .	3.7176735630969526

So , let us draw that .	6.543343888652673

And , there is a partial ionization of these alkyl bridge and also polarization of this monomers , which produce this intermediate , which then form a six membered ring transition state ; which basically form a six membered ring transition state .	2.3180423367073453

You can draw yourself .	8.069430375596584

And so that is the six membered ring transition state .	5.05588310521144

And what happened now ?	8.227633068342312

So , we have now .	8.822778299632617

So , insertion inserting this monomer , a new monomer in the aluminum alkyl aluminum carbon bond , which will form the regeneration of the bridge complex .	3.0246153584598514

So , again what happened ?	8.085974992311323

The next monomer comes and get inserted here same mechanism and you get a linear poly olefins in this case .	3.67928852331704

Now this case , the vacant d - orbital present in the transition metal is the main source of catalytic activity .	4.107035636952485

And the chain growth occurs in titanium alkyl bond .	4.116838308427573

In this case , you have seen the chain growth , of course in aluminum bond .	4.504227001382026

In the monometallic case , we are talking about the chain insertion or the chain growth happening in the titanium carbon bond .	3.2820053021697677

And in this case , the vacant d - orbital present in the transition metal in the main source of catalytic activity And as we said and as I said , that insertion happens in between the titanium and carbon bond .	3.2522750342020457

So , if we consider the example , we given earlier .	5.521569430615064

Let us take the same example to get the or discuss the mechanism .	4.104443686768343

Now , this is the octahedrally coordinated crystal and because it has to maintain electron neutrality , the titanium or the surface is five coordinated titanium and have a vacant d - orbital .	2.9959542941500694

And what happened at the beginning ?	5.985216892977736

At the active center , the formation happened by addition of a alkyl to this vacant d - orbital of five coordinated titanium three plus .	2.932225169918588

So , there is a… let me draw that .	5.7013673797168725

So the surface , the titanium which is present at the surface is that is five coordinated titanium three plus and that has a vacant d - orbital .	3.42534485934571

We are writing this as a vacant d - orbital .	5.454563707365651

Now the initially what happened ?	6.004844180815801

This alkyl aluminum compound gets chemisorbed .	4.872880661750199

In that , vacant d - orbital and titanium gets alkylated .	3.799425425670293

And this now is a active center .	4.7171122180229474

This initiates the polymerization .	8.397442491311642

We will let me drive the draw the mechanism in a separate page .	2.9142890503376617

And these are all chlorine atoms , which are firmly embedded in the crystal of titanium alpha titanium chloride , again which we are writing the polymer residue here ; ‘ p ’ as a polymer residue .	2.785213852523288

Now , the monomer gets coordinated form pi complex with the vacant d - orbital .	3.312274324225667

Monomer gets coordinated to the vacant or empty d - orbital .	3.5156248752463495

So , it forms a four membered cyclic transition state .	3.7813214342428125

And then , this new monomer gets inserted in the titanium carbon bond .	2.9518180027014336

In earlier case , in bimetallic case we proposed… the mechanism was proposed where the new monomer is getting inserted in the aluminum carbon bond .	2.6602768729704684

In this case , the new monomer is getting inserted in the titanium alkyl bond and regenerating the vacant d - orbital .	2.8650088848893134

So , CH2 - CH X - CH2 - CHX - P .	4.111316136992459

So , now this is regenerated .	7.13075396684142

This active center is regenerated .	6.296281443412525

So , again one more monomer comes and the cyclic four membered cyclic transition formation takes place and the monomer gets inserted in the titanium carbon bond .	2.68101295697077

So , the polymer , linear polymerization takes place .	4.360728571225984

Now , let us discuss few features of Ziegler - Natta polymerization which is the mechanism , we just talked about the monometallic mechanism .	4.174080603024197

We all talked about that .	8.750944482251562

Let me just summarize one more time the features .	4.907400472815364

So , basically an octahedral vacancy of the d - orbital of titanium three plus is available to complex with the incoming monomer .	2.7306793218243746

So , in this case there is a vacant d - rbital , which is available for complexation with the incoming monomer .	3.428813443898368

The orientation of the coordinate coordinated monomer is determined by the steric and electronic interaction with the ligands around the transition metals .	2.7719201605680612

So , basically these are the ligands .	8.574592154337122

And the propagation step is completed by insertion of the coordinated monomer in the metal , transition metal carbon bond as we discussed now .	3.091170579293938

And , the growing polymer chain is always attached to the transition metal .	4.950575776505462

Remember in case of bimetallic , the growing polymer chain was attached to the aluminum metal .	3.995534950672906

The orientation of the monomer as it inserts into the metal carbon bond , determines the configuration of the stereo center in the newly formed terminal unit .	2.727446076006296

You know , that is obvious ; what is the orientation of the monomer , when it gets complex and inserted , that orientation is determined by the stereo center , whether it will be isotactic or syndiotactic .	3.183283474010269

An isotactic polymer is always formed when it is preferred orientation for coordination is much lower than the other .	3.515084053417637

The isotactic polymerization formation takes place .	5.452692868265394

So , once initiation propagation is done , let us just glance through the possible mechanism by which we can terminate .	3.292205325796547

These Zeigler - Natta polymers or coordinated polymers get terminated .	3.516409668119354

And termination actually can happen in one of the three ways , like just , am just doing it a little fast .	3.4709660513770917

There is nothing more to understand and it is just for information purpose .	4.282341574020134

These hydride can get terminated and transferred to the transition metal forming a within end group in the polymer .	3.7803094950960685

It can also get transferred to a monomer ; a monomer forming or forming this combination .	3.5011701821918644

Basically if you take this example , propylene by titanium catalyst ; now , this can get transferred and you can have the chain get terminated .	3.962286267469908

The chain can terminate , the chain can transfer to compounds , added compounds , which are having active hydrogens .	3.1878925072165183

We can write this generic structure of H - T with active hydrogen .	4.019537547167267

Then , this chain transfer can happen to this and the chain can get terminated .	4.614054375563047

Now , so this is all about the Zeigler - Natta polymerization .	5.460331121917659

And , this is the majority of the industrial polymers .	6.114695726621767

And Olefin industrial polymers was synthesized by this catalyst combination , Zeigler - Natta catalyst , till the discovery of metallocene catalyzed coordination polymerization .	2.239578276094674

Now in case of metalist , now what I have not talked till now that this is heterogeneous polymerization .	3.8930198781441834

When you mix this alkyl aluminum and titanium chloride , the catalyst actually gets precipitate from the solution and when you add ethylene or propylene , it is a heterogeneous polymerization .	3.2168542392770685

Now metallocene , you can actually do the polymerization in the homogeneous medium .	5.035183401530431

Metallocene polymerization can be done in solution in a homogeneous medium .	5.838638649398848

And the advantage is that at the end of the reaction , you can isolate the metallocene catalyst and then purify and reuse .	3.208954140002834

Now , what is metallocene polymerization ?	5.541703082140622

You can give a generalized structure of metallocene catalyst like this where or you can write a structural L L dash M t X 2 ; where L L dash are the ligands which can be equal .	3.1110976407735498

Generally , this metal used is a group four transition metal and in most cases it is zirconium and so zirconocene is what is mostly used in case of metallocenes polymers .	3.0533316942252164

And X is a , most cases it is a chloride and sometimes it is CH 3 .	4.945643419623435

Now this require , this is like this titanium transition metal in Zeigler - Natta polymerization , this requires another co - catalyst like alkyl aluminum as is in the case of Zeigler - Natta polymerization .	2.894994277189549

But if we use alkyl aluminum , then what happened ?	4.41347546342536

The stereo specificity was not very high .	5.3117940496353

So , the most used co - catalyst is MAO which is a methylaluminoxane , which is network compound of this .	3.052764485946623

Now for example , let us take a metallocene polymerization .	4.801696919055322

This is a C p cyclopentadienyl , C p 2 say titanium chloride , inclination of MAO .	2.7020001383969583

MAO does actually two things .	6.5340198908984375

It is alkylate ; first it is alkylate , the metal and then abstract one halogen and form metal… ion and which generates one vacant or vital .	2.1085109775420015

And , rest of the mechanism is same as we discussed in case of Zeigler - Natta polymerization in , like the insertion of polymer monomer molecules .	4.147749042317548

So , rest of the propagation and propagation follow the same similar mechanism as we discussed in case of Zeigler - Natta polymerization .	4.088427034640833

So , with this we have completed our discussion on Stereochemistry , Polymer Stereochemistry and coordination polymerization .	3.148709273831436

Now in this lecture itself , we basically completed our module on polymer synthesis .	3.68353238027916

What , till now what has happ…till this twenty four lectures was except the first few couple of lectures , where we give introduction about polymers .	2.150413781356665

Rest of that twenty two lectures or twenty one lectures , we discussed how to synthesize polymers .	3.0355634594663496

Now , what are the different ways we can synthesize the polymers .	3.792085453547428

And I tried to give emphasize on the polymerization or synthetic process which are important , which are used very frequently or which are more important industrially .	3.250192679791377

For example , we solid - state polymerization , ring opening method , this is polymerization or group transfer polymerization .	2.692654761525179

Now , these are a not very common example of polymer synthesis or lots of industrial polymers are not used by this technique .	3.302689556044117

So , it can be covered in a specialized course on polymer synthesis itself .	4.905962568284039

So , in a general course like this of on Polymer Chemistry , we are not going in details on this type of specialized polymerization technique .	3.089548168522707

So , you are requested , if you are interested you can go and read a or consult a specialized book on polymer synthesis to know more about this polymerization techniques .	2.7132624954758637

Now before we end this lecture , let us go through the commercial , a few commercial coordination polymers .	3.3215221797209877

And you can for example , high density polyethylene which has low branching , high crystallinity , high density .	2.7899225588610896

You can actually use these coordination polymers to make high molecular weight , high density polyethylene or ultra - high molecular polyethylene .	3.073412068367477

You can make low density polyethylene as well by copolymerizing with slight amount of one olefin , such as one butylene or one hexylene along very slight amount with ethylene that , we will basically introduce to do branches and reduce the crystallization , increase reduce the density as well .	2.0701618466786345

And as we said that , stereo regular polypropylene like isotactic polypropylene and syndiotactic polymers are useful to synthesize .	2.783720493203943

So , with this we come to end in this module of polymer synthesis .	4.354922363147122

In next lecture onwards , what we will do ?	4.674023785820249

we will study the characterizes process , characterization of process , how after making this polymers what are the ways we will characterize and even with the polymers , which we have learnt for last twenty four lecture .	2.8854541416515103

Last time we were discussing about the application of the immobilized enzymes and we had mentioned that the enzymes find applications in a variety of situations and we dealt with the applications of immobilized enzymes as industrial biocatalyst in process industries .	3.2948520664286196

Two major sectors of applications of immobilized enzymes are analytical applications and also their application in the therapeutics for the treatment of diseases in human beings and both the applications are also particularly important or in contrast to the application as industrial catalyst lies in the effect that you require much more purified systems and the use of high value enzymes in their applications unlike in the case of industrial biocatalyst where mostly we were dealing with relatively lesser valued enzymes and the two applications on analytical applications and therapeutics require relatively high value enzymes and in a higher purified state .	2.4211839144007907

Just to take up the analytical applications the variety of applications that have been reported can be classified into four different types : the first is automated analysis procedures by combining immobilized enzymes with various analytical tools .	2.6228572302015016

One way is as you must have done in your laboratory class the use of glucose oxidase for example for assay of glucose .	3.5571690977318453

The use of soluble enzyme may be fine if you have to analyze let us say couple of samples three or four .	4.2760080470225414

But in situation where the sample to be analyzed are in very large number and very often such instances are met in hospitals and in clinical laboratories where few hundreds of samples everyday are encountered and use of soluble enzyme may be some times uneconomical .	2.4670713660757695

Similarly in research also a student might be analyzing the similar sample hundreds of them over a day and just to get his results .	2.306992375312565

So in those cases the analytical procedures can be automated by combining the immobilized enzymes , instead of soluble enzyme , with a standard analytical device .	2.912999452057431

It could be a spectrophotometer , it could be a fluorospectrophotometer , it could be as simple as pH meter .	4.111731248550714

So any analytical simple analytical tool can be combined and used .	3.2430500422706916

A very simple example of this approach was reported by Hicks and Updike way back in 66 .	3.1544782409849668

Another point is the bulk of the analytical applications were the earliest uses of immobilized enzymes .	4.230337383332301

In fact their application in process industry was adopted much later than they were used in analytical applications and that means the cost implications are much more severe in analytical sections .	2.680717967914856

The setup is like this that the given sample in which a chemical species to be analyzed is passed through an immobilized enzyme column a very small column and here in this reference it was glucose or lactic acid determination based on glucose oxidase or lactate dehydrogenase and they were immobilized on polyacrolymide gel and packed in a very small column and the substrate was fed at 0.8 ml per minute and then this is passed through a delay line so that you provide a reaction time and a coloured reagent is added here and after that in a spectrophotometer , a photometric cell which is connected to a system , the reaction passes the and color developed is monitored .	2.4602975815376102

You can also have some standard solutions and this is a two way valve whereby you can either put a standard solution and measure observant in the photometer or you can put the actual cell and on the other side you have a buffer or a control solution which also passes through a delay line and a different photometer of the same wavelength and to empty the photometer tube pulses are used so that in a pulse mode the tubes are filled and emptied while the flow is continuous for the photometer measures in a pulse mode and the materials are removed .	2.4084264968038105

In fact two of the systems which were very early reported were glucose by glucose oxidase and lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase .	2.5303680832305804

This is the kind of reaction that takes place in the immobilized enzyme column .	6.764796656937658

The lactic acid sample itself is mixed with NAD solution and pyruvic acid is formed with reduced NAD and reduced NAD is then oxidized with a dye DPI and then the NAD gets regenerated that means that is oxidized and reduced dye is colourless .	2.1562964183518303

This DPI is blue and this is colourless .	6.355937039579842

So difference in the absorbance is related to the concentration of the lactic acid .	5.233349788225427

On the other hand , in the case of glucose it is glucose to gluconic acid plus hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidizing agent and it oxidizes the DPI to coloured product which is blue in color and is measured .	2.14002009799009

A large number of other dyes also have been reported and this dye is only just to facilitate the measurement of the colour .	2.980506272137162

Two other very interesting examples also came in almost during the same time in 64 and 65 .	3.1554247439938927

Riesel and Katchalski in Israel reported the use of urease immobilized on diazotized amino acid copolymer used for the determination of urea in urine or serum and also for the removal of urea from body fluids .	2.251290943380596

The urea system in urine samples is used today in many large hospitals on a commercial scale where the requirement is almost thousands samples in a day .	2.222308494713803

So instead of employing number of analysts they have an auto analyzer in which the immobilized column can carry out the job and almost thousand samples can be analyzed using a single cartage of immobilized enzyme and the cost can be saved effectively .	2.798836661066328

The other report is by Gilbault and Kramer in 65 .	3.3902696974178013

They did for cholinesterase which was entrapped in a starch matrix and it was used for continuous detection of anti - cholinesterase .	2.5966749918237335

This is an example not really of a metabolite or some kind of a substrate or the product but it was just like an environmental analysis where the presence of certain cholinesterase inhibitors present in either effluents or nearby as a result of pollution were monitored continuously using an immobilized cholinesterase entrapped in a starch matrix plus a fluorescence spectrophotometer because the product ultimately gives a fluorescence and the change in fluorescence as a result of inhibitor present .	2.362949454182816

That means florescence decreases and by that one can monitor continuously and the measurement of florescence gives you a direct indication of the concentration of inhibitor in the feed stream .	3.4033761857657185

The second class of analytical applications is enzyme electrodes .	3.7530398696208214

Although it is listed as second it has become commercially a very , very important sector of analytical tool .	3.0930923613376606

What is an enzyme electrode ?	8.705395735551589

In general we call it a biosensor , an analytical device .	4.055884282148318

We know the transducer to utilize the selective analysis of a biochemical species in a sample .	2.7315018312016823

So there are three distinct segments one is the biological unit which is integrated with a transducer and the third is anylate .	3.2256189769207735

These three systems , the biological unit , transducer and anylate have to have a linkage .	3.8274393858212994

That means if this anylate has to recognize this biological unit there must be an affinity between the two .	2.924112673115685

Secondly the substrate or the product of the reaction which comes out as a result of this interaction must be able to generate a measurable parameter which can be measured by transducer in quantitative terms so that it can be related with either the substrate concentration or some species in the sample .	3.694761206376539

Anylate means that chemical species which is to be analyzed say for example you want to analyze sugar some glucose in blood ; glucose is the anylate .	3.6120573763284036

The chemical species which needs to be analyzed is anylate .	4.933175606547585

In other words the concept is very simple and a large variety of biological units have been used to prepare biosensors .	4.0225218718209605

As far as we are concerned you will be stressing more on enzymes as biological units but other than enzyme you can also use microbial cells , plant cells , animal cells , cell membrane , Lectins or antibodies depending upon the anylate .	2.592468677195855

The purpose is that the chemical species to be analyzed must have a specific recognition for the biological unit and the type of transducers that are very commonly used are amperometric or potentiometric electrodes and the recent year developments have been in the area of field effect transistors , thermisters .	2.5861246925467625

But still on commercial level amperometric and potentiometric transducers are the common tools that are used in bulk .	3.2283354974400753

Anylate is the chemical species which is to be monitored in the sample .	4.763635452685158

Say for example if you want to monitor urea in urine samples ; urea is the anylate , urine is a sample the fluid to be analyzed and the biological unit which is recognizing that analate is the material either an enzymes or a cell which has the some affinity for that molecule and you need a physical transducer which can sense either the substrate or the product or any other signal which is generated through the reaction .	2.4789389149570633

I will come to that later .	6.116573557203749

This is immobilized enzyme .	8.576028815451322

The substrate molecule recognizes the enzyme species present on the immobilized enzyme .	5.624322870918175

There can be a membrane through which the product or any other species which comes out as a result of reaction passes through and approaches transducer , an analytical device which generates a signal that can be monitored .	3.018980237041203

It can be in the form of a current ; it can be in the form of potential difference ; it can be the form of temperature change and variety of signals can be generated and that depends on the type of ……… producing .	4.06092575007097

Secondly convert the recognition process into a physico - chemical change which either directly or indirectly generates the current .	2.3489834969588625

In the electrical circuit current is a very easily measurable parameter and just to make it suitable for repeated use we need to immobilize the bio element .	3.205735287270231

Theoretically the system can be used in a soluble form also but just to make it a continuously usable system the bio element is immobilized .	3.4256647507525684

What kinds of electrodes are used usually ?	4.638888755259239

Take for example pH electrode in a laboratory .	4.737095402655386

pH electrode is a transducer , one of the transducers which can be used in the case of an enzyme electrode .	5.044334280781766

What you simply need to do is at the tip of the electrode you need to insert by some mechanism an immobilized enzyme layer so that when you dip that electrode into a sample liquid , the sample comes in contact with immobilized enzyme layer usually in the form of thin film and the reaction takes place ; the product goes through and it is sensed by the pH electrode .	2.9430341713799506

pH electrode is a potentiometric transducer .	5.496084226765738

It generates the potential and that potential is measured and calibrated in the form of pH change and that can be used simply .	3.577151762801314

In principle the enzyme is bound to ion selective electrode that will detect the presence of a substrate or product .	4.081096214647903

That means if the substrate is ionisable it can be measured or it can measure the product of the enzyme catalyzed reaction .	4.627812191249092

The transducer measures the potential difference between a reference and sensing electrode .	3.1428908513174996

We are not doing any manipulation with the transducer ; we use the commercially available transducers .	2.947914728981167

It could be a …. .. electrode what you use in the fermentor for measurement of dissolved oxygen because that is amperometric transducer ; it measures current .	2.678650446152985

On the other hand a simple pH meter or an ammonium ion electrode or carbon dioxide electrode they are potentiometric transducers .	2.168749709143969

No that mechanism can be developed , but it should be in proximity with the electrode .	3.874173496502411

That means the tip should be next to the sensing site of the electrode .	3.422993957293765

I will illustrate how we do that but the basic principle is that it should be in the proximity of the sensing site of the transducer .	3.462017496457011

One can manipulate and develop number of the strategies like an amperometric …. .. type dissolved oxygen electrode what you use in the case of fermentation fluids for measurement of dissolved oxygen .	2.8253552498745877

That means at the tip of the transducer you have a PTFE membrane so that the sample in which the analysis has to be done for dissolved oxygen is separated from KCl solution because that should not get mixed and a potential of about 0.5 to 0.8 volts , a constant value , is applied because this constant voltage applied will determine the calibration of the current which is generated as a result of dissolved oxygen when it comes in contact with the electrode .	2.803050571031018

The potential of 0.5 to 0.8 volts is usually applied across the electrode and the current generated is proportional to the concentration of the substrate in the sample .	3.344598534455336

The current generated is reflected by dissolved oxygen concentration because on the cathode it is the oxygen which takes up the protons generated on the anode .	2.533595674267527

This dissolved oxygen is a function or is a parameter which is participating in the reaction .	4.646630974090228

In enzymatic reactions usually there will be oxidoreductases , redox reactions if they consume oxygen or give out oxygen a difference in the dissolved oxygen can be used to measure the substrate .	3.0391620296651283

At the electrode is measured dissolved oxygen but the consumption of dissolved oxygen in the fluid is a result of enzymatic reaction .	3.0481352390777605

For example consider glucose .	7.575763195198397

Glucose plus oxygen will give you gluconic acid and in the sample when you bring the glucose sample in proximity of the electrode which has the glucose oxidase as enzyme deposited on it the enzyme will react with the glucose in the presence of oxygen and consume oxygen .	3.217624470147183

Just like in the earlier automated devices you can have small immobilized enzyme columns and link it to the photometer .	3.6618849745241033

That is possible but again to use it in terms of convenience use of pH electrode is very simple .	3.586402869415977

You just dip in the solution and get the result , output whereas if you have to really set up an auto analyzer it will have a full fledged setup with all tubing and you will have a reaction period and all those things and ultimately you will end up in a very cumbersome system .	3.406132822703947

You can have either way ; also you can put your enzyme into a column and pass it through a spectrophotometer ; that can be automated ; no doubt about it .	3.0894486147102795

The three parameters which are important in the case of an enzyme electrode are selectivity .	4.813997916747847

The selectivity is a function which is offered to it by enzyme because the enzyme has to be chosen which is highly selective for and that choice is important because if you are not able to choose very selective enzyme the analysis may not be very specific .	3.1140228601285616

Then sensitivity ; Sensitivity is a function of the Km value of the enzyme that means the range of analysis that it can perform that will depend on the Km value of the enzyme .	4.357956138215311

Usually immobilized enzyme is supplied in the form of sandwich between the membranes so that they can be replaced on the tip .	3.9239961036319246

This is a picture of a typical enzyme electrode which we used in our own laboratory .	3.050158991055388

It is a dissolved oxygen electrode ; simple one showing different components .	3.327709017644566

You have a gold cathode , silver anode and Teflon membrane at the tip ; that is the main electrode has a Teflon membrane on the tip .	2.789593934431949

We put another dialysis membrane over this Teflon membrane and this separates the enzyme which is immobilized in the form of a thin film and particularly in this case study which I was referring to , the immobilized enzyme is cellulose acetate membrane .	3.330689901885757

Just to provide a support it is inserted between dialysis tubes which is permeable to small molecular weight compound like glucose freely and which is put on this Teflon membrane which is already present in the dissolved oxygen electrode .	2.894773208407082

The other system what you see is a sleeve .	3.913911394935527

This sleeve is just to insert the enzyme membrane on to the electrode as a as a ……… .	3.8369230957076432

so that you insert on the tip the enzyme membrane .	5.414053629902152

Here you see a bigger view .	5.567146130862738

You can have for example glucose measurement .	4.998876927679015

You have a silver anode and platinum cathode , a plastic membrane which is supposed to protect anode and cathode which separates the fluid from the internal fluid and after that we put an enzyme gel layer .	2.2582748120206104

You can have some kind of sleeve which holds this layer .	3.7132141413333373

Like in our case we had reverse sleeve which is covered over the tip of the electrode so that the film remains intact on the electrode and it is separate because being inserted in the dialysis bed , it is separated from the PTFE membrane also and it also provides the analytical molecule to permeate through it and come in proximity with the enzyme .	2.5587906955185975

No ; enzyme is not leaving direct contact with the anode and cathode .	4.429446994545181

Anode and cathode only come in picture with either the substrate or the product which is a result of the enzyme reaction like for example here you see the second case which is for L - amino acid oxidase you have a simple glass electrode just like pH electrode .	3.845893605929183

They have put an enzyme solution in an ultra filtration membrane or cellophane membrane or you can say dialysis bed which is closed at the bottom and the electrode is dipped into it .	2.9321303918832324

That has been supported by ‘ O ’ rings just like we have put a sleeve in the earlier case .	3.0458858860083464

You put ‘ O ’ rings so that the dialysis bed which contains the enzyme is in proximity of the enzyme and it can be used for measurement systems .	4.926012255011333

We are indirectly measuring glucose via measurement of dissolved oxygen .	3.2102752021296017

The dissolved oxygen electrode will measure dissolved oxygen only ; it cannot measure glucose directly .	2.9051284447064627

But the glucose concentration results in either production or consumption of oxygen as a result of the enzyme reaction and that is the purpose .	4.086839924979184

Large number of enzyme electrodes have been prepared and listed here are the ones which are commercially available .	3.0680365206096156

There are many other experimental electrodes which have been made and reported in the literature .	3.8762315369514675

For example glucose is the most commonly used electrode and the immobilization method polyacrylamide gel ; oxygen electrode is electrode used and the concentration range it can measure is of the order of ten to the power of minus five to ten to the power of minus four molar .	2.91833554137279

I like you to see the sensitivity of the measurement which is probably much higher than any physical or chemical measurement system at this concentration level .	2.658468979090104

That is we are talking in the micro molar range .	5.47620825071977

In the case of urea , urease is the enzyme , immobilization method is polyacrylamide gel and ammonium ion electrode is used , ion selective potentiometric electrode and the range is one to ten micro molar .	2.443543675988981

In the case of cholesterol , cholesterol oxidase , collagen membrane and oxygen electrode is the measurement device .	2.731892086715974

In all reactions which are redox reactions oxygen electrodes are used and if any other ion selective measurement has to be done then the potentiometric electrometer is used .	2.9410623778146174

For urea , urease is the enzyme , ultra filtration membrane CO two electrode , an ion selective electrode .	2.8999219976374673

Then penicillin measurement using an enzyme penicillinase which hydrolyzes penicillin using a glass electrode , this can also be measured .	2.7849477400388305

The advantage is in an industry if they have to monitor the penicillin concentration of their bath on an online basis any chemical measurement will take time .	2.4578156105716977

The report may take two hour .	4.942624174854506

Whereas if the plant operator has an electrode in his pocket and he takes a sample and dips into it , the control becomes very easy .	2.2325331933231025

He can immediately take a decision to either switch on or switch off or terminate ; whatever decision has to be taken on the plan and in those cases such systems are very , very useful .	2.724872283347562

Another analytical device based on immobilized enzyme is enzyme thermisters .	4.259255302169392

The enzyme thermisters are based on the measurement of temperature difference of the reaction liquid in an exothermic biochemical reaction .	3.9162999781645507

Mind it that we are talking of exothermic biochemical reaction .	4.950886891133607

Many of the enzyme reactions which are highly isothermal , I am just comparing the two , although they are known to be in all broad range as isothermal reactions they will have some value of ?	3.6789588552075663

H . So those which have slightly higher ?	4.93117514779142

H value among enzyme reactions they can be used for enzyme thermisters because they will induce a change in the temperature .	3.957965026209905

Although temperature change as you will notice is much smaller .	5.527268758595581

This involves the use of semi conductor material showing a large resistance change with temperature .	3.322785993541751

So measurement of temperature is based on the change in resistance of a semiconductor material as a function of temperature .	4.062262868419368

In semiconductors , the expression which relates the resistance with reference to temperature T one and T two , resistance changes and all those material and semiconductors are known to have a high change in resistance as a function of temperature and they are used here as the sensing device .	2.8194043083626767

So thermister is nothing else but a semiconductor material which is connected to a circuit which measures impedance and if that is put at the tip of the effluent stream of the immobilized enzyme reaction you can use it for measurement of temperature .	3.001259802699667

In practice a well insulated immobilized enzyme column is used .	3.614127701155523

The most difficult part of the enzyme thermister is the very high order of insulation required because the temperature which we are measuring is probably a fraction of the integer ; some times as low as 0.1º centigrade , one hundredth of a centigrade ; that is the kind of temperature change we are talking about to ensure very high order of insulation and the effectiveness of this system depends on the quality of insulation one can provide .	2.96319406996124

The thermister is mounted at the extreme end of the fluid .	4.671079734980364

The ? T is indicated by a change in impedance and the range of temperature measurement for different enzymes lies in 0.004 to 1º degree centigrade .	2.996245741495606

Higher this change is the system can be more effective usually it has been noted that only those enzymes which can generate a temperature change more than 0.1º centigrade are effective .	2.9915835897223477

0.004 is a …… size but you need some reliably measurable amount of temperature change .	2.9569158688665116

The suitability of enzyme thermister depends on the enthalpy changes associated with the biochemical reaction .	3.6750200741670747

More exothermic the reaction we are handling , the system can be more effective .	4.491638495173488

If you look into some values of ?	5.287987440326076

H in the case of catalase , it is 100.4 kilo joules per mole .	5.0003693235699105

This is probably one of the highest ?	7.647304473771599

H value in the case of enzymatic reactions and this gives almost about a temperature change of 0.2 to 0.3 degree centigrade which can be very easily monitored .	4.43612602576756

Glucose oxidase 80 kilo joules per mole ; hexokinase 27.6 kilo joules per mole ; lactate dehydroginase another good system 62.1 and urease with the urea only 6.6 .	2.1994324449520657

As a matter of fact the urease , this system is usually not very effective and the first four ones are considered to be very effective and the system is not commercialized but in many laboratories they have been tested , used and reported .	2.678043265362638

The same anylate whatever substrate concentration , the change of temperature which is measured in terms of change in resistance is related to the change of substrate concentration .	4.1675997667023665

This is per mole ; per mole of substrate consumed means so much of ……. .. Just like any chemical reaction you have a ?	3.5741857526358456

H value .	26.129359816669716

Then the third area of application of enzyme , analytical application I am referring to , is the structural analysis of bio macromolecules .	2.6299537895548823

You must be familiar with the primary structural determination of proteins .	3.7080625313124433

Usually we take a protein , hydrolyze it by using some enzymes or chemical means by acid or alkali and monitor the different amino acids that are produced .	2.801162577918892

The same job can be done by immobilized enzyme in a more controlled way and you can have controlled hydrolysis .	4.515544838381574

The …… advantage , the kind of problem that is faced in the case of classical analysis is the removal of the hydrolyzing agent that is acid or alkali or even the soluble enzyme .	2.829177381784317

Removal from the sample is very tedious task and also causes in some cases for example tryptophan , it is destroyed by alkali .	2.9185658682231406

So alkaline hydrolysis , which is very commonly used for determination of primary structure does not measure tryptophan .	3.3200646982243573

But if you use a column of immobilized enzyme for a controlled hydrolysis of a protein sample , first thing no amino acid will be destroyed .	3.147115357859788

They will also liberate the D - amino acids if there are , which are very uncommon occurrences in proteins can also be analyzed .	3.6439966599842104

The basic concept is that we can analyze amino acid composition of proteins by using immobilized proteases or base composition of nucleic acids if we use immobilized phosphatases .	2.7913946268070324

If you take the phosphoesterases and immobilize them , then you can have the base composition because the hydrolysis will yield and then you can have a controlled hydrolysis and see the sequence .	3.3077620496706244

The principle remains the same as in the case of soluble enzyme but the preparation of the analytical samples becomes very easy because then you don ’ t have to separate the hydrolyzing agents , the catalyst .	2.894591660244267

You can simply either filter it off or centrifuge and your sample is ready for analysis .	2.585135880639534

A major advantage is in cases where sample contains amino acids that decompose by acid or alkali such as tryptophan and detection of D - amino acids .	2.6181413131935445

The conventional use of enzymes in therapeutic has been the use of proteases .	4.635983607035284

For variety of situations that range from digestion aid to even treatment of certain deceases which involve the availability of one of the enzyme or removal of some metabolite from the body .	2.69898567006153

A very large range of application sectors in the therapy have been known with soluble enzymes .	2.7294901624857615

But the use of soluble enzymes has certain very serious problems and the problems are listed here : one is that the enzyme has a higher molecular mass , a very large molecule protein and impermeability through biological membranes .	3.314018898402916

In fact the efficacy of any drug or a therapeutic agent depends on its permeability through biological membranes and even the efficacy of a chemical drug will depend on it ’ s ability to permeate through the biological membranes and reach to the site .	2.3721376213527394

So the larger the molecule as the enzymes are it posses serious problem in the permeability and the most toughest biological membrane through which the drug has to permeate is brain membranes .	2.4561990278248578

As a matter of fact almost all drugs which are required to be given for action at brain as the site the concentrations are very high almost 4 to eight times more that of the same drug if it is used at some other site in the body .	2.646706684824967

Say for example steroids .	7.973132352818601

If they have to be administered for some inflammation at some site leg or hand , you can give a very small dose ; it will reach the site and treat the patient .	2.730733410854007

But if the inflammation is in the brain at least ten fold concentration of the drug is required to be administered because lesser than that will not even permeate to the brain membrane .	2.888594123459374

So giving it will be useless it go to all over the body excepting brain .	3.750994114932429

If you give higher dose you end up in another problem of side effects because there is no drug which is free of side effects .	3.0748136765327057

You are taking it to cure the decease but slowly you are also getting exposed to certain side effects .	2.4386130728559356

So therefore the high molecular mass which results into impermeability through the biological membranes is a major problem .	3.10741773158112

Ultimately the drug has to reach into the biological fluids , save blood or let ’ s say it has to reach to stomach .	3.185165368984264

There might be certain inhibitors present for the enzyme which might reduce the rate of reaction or there might be some proteolytic enzymes present and they can inactivate the enzyme protein .	3.5774225765231913

Any therapeutic device must take care of these problems if it has to be effective .	4.121556184370855

That means one should ensure what is the site of action required ?	4.659069006026591

what is the biological view there ?	11.461630570203896

What is the chemical view there ?	5.8763626413642145

What are the inhibitors present ?	6.607695593028552

What is the pH ?	9.890058110056028

What is the temperature and then only the enzyme function can be ensured .	4.788059426084333

Third is antigenic properties hypersensitibity and immunological reactions .	3.4521984545749835

Number of approaches has been used to overcome this problem and some enzymes had become easily admissible .	2.9283384845572766

I like to illustrate only one example which has become quite interesting say for example in the case of patients who suffer from partial kidney failure .	2.9624784822026147

That means kidney is probably one of the excellent examples of a filtration system , highly specific filtration system in the body .	2.82592268834901

I don ’ t think any other filtration device is available which is so specific and lasting .	2.522505833825045

Still in some cases the partial failure takes place and the kidney is not able to filter out or remove urea .	3.1899639999575617

So the urea concentration in the blood stream increases and it can cause many metabolic problems and it is ultimately fatal .	3.9654687418451124

There are other chemical treatments but the last resort is to put on a dialysis system .	2.752404518953176

That means dialysis is something like an artificial organ ; it ’ s like an artificial kidney that you take out the blood and put it in an extra ……. .. .	2.9173902125554636

This is the living body and the blood passes through the dialysis membrane , a dialysis device in which the blood is dialyzed against a dialysate , usually a buffer .	2.331986456063064

The quantity of buffer that has to be administered or that has to be passed in the conventional dialysis unit is 100 to 300 lts .	3.2074095303378134

This is the range .	8.779882493054338

In cases where the concentration of urea is much larger in the blood stream you may have to require more fluid to pass and because of this large volume required for dialysis usually a specific patient has to be hospitalized and the whole setup of a hospital has to be used for dialysis .	3.028789914297924

This system which has been followed in the past has lot of problems .	3.739181914755075

One is that the patient after sometime fails to respond to dialysis , if the concentration goes very high the volume of the dialysate required is very large .	3.1455621541858925

The frequency required is very high that means initially he starts a dialysis once in a month and he may end up in daily dialysis .	2.8210272335427766

Putting one daily for dialysis in hospital is also very difficult task because ultimately what you are doing is you are circulating the whole of his body blood through a dialysis system ; it ’ s a very tedious system if we look at and you are just putting a secondary circulation system of blood which already exist in the body .	2.4187056462702263

The alternate to that is use of immobilized urease and this is an example of an artificial organ which is commercialized which is available commercially and with such a system a patient doesn ’ t have to go hospital because the volume of dialysate they require is only about a liter which he can safely install at the site of his bed in the house and use himself .	2.575000994332601

The principle remains the same .	5.843366245380049

You take blood in ; the dialyser unit is little compact same dialysis bag only thing is much smaller because as soon as the urea comes in the dialysate instead of being thrown out it is passed through an immobilized enzyme column , the one which is shown here as microcapsule in which ion exchange resin and the enzyme have been immobilized in microcapsules .	2.4929291097387414

So the urea which comes out in the dialysate is hydrolyzed to ammonia ; ammonia is absorbed by the ion exchange resin .	2.9300173438511536

Carbon dioxide is not allowed its not bothered about because carbon dioxide even if it reaches in the blood the body has a capacity to exit out to lungs assuming that the lungs are functioning properly of the patient .	2.141521680333205

So carbon dioxide can be left out ; but ammonia cannot be sent back to the body and ammonia is removed by ion exchange resins and other metabolite which are generated if any in the blood sample they are taken care by activated carbon and the body fluid of the blood through a system is then sent back into the patient valve .	2.195743730306179

The advantage here is from the practical point of view instead of dialysate volume using about of the order of three hundred liters we are talking of one or two liters of dialysate and because you are regenerating the dialysate by removing the urea formed in the system and that kind of system is commercially available .	2.7771156211544303

In the box , in an expanded view of the column in which the microcapsule contains the enzyme and the ion exchange resin the reaction takes place ; urea gets converted into carbon dioxide and ammonia .	2.9908258767408076

Carbon dioxide is led off in the blood stream for the body to take care and the ammonia is taken care by the ion exchange beads and the size approximately of these microcapsules is the order of two hundred to eight hundred microns ; very fine microcapsules almost like a tiny set and they are packed and this system is obtainable .	2.373596882334807

Besides the use of immobilized enzyme as industrial catalyst , the immobilized enzymes has a major role to play even for analytical devices and for therapeutic purposes .	3.3782816139617906

I must stress again that at least these two applications have lesser implication as for the economic systems .	2.724767625515881

I think the issue of economics is very , very important in their use in the process industries .	4.166913786682428

Analytical systems also because the quantity of enzyme required are so low that probably the economics rather is always in favor because you save tremendously in the cost of labour .	2.628332214898308

As I mentioned to you that I have seen myself the analysis in atleast one of the hospitals in Sweden almost about thousand samples in a day done by an auto analyzer using immobilized enzyme and which would have required at least ten persons and you are aware that the hiring of the person is the last thing , at least in the western world .	2.229251453369311

They will try to replace any person with a machine ; that is cheaper and the cost of analysis works out to be very cheap if you compare with hiring a person and also more reliable .	2.6972626441315035

The human error is by and large avoided .	4.505839371803336

Let us continue our discussion on step growth polymerization .	4.831327040438882

Now , before we come to this lectures topic , let us just recapitulate what we have learnt in last lecture .	3.3054709030846476

In last lecture , we have completed the kinetics of step polymerization and we have seen what is after looking at the kinetic expression .	4.1940488670994265

We are convinced that in for polymer chemistry , this life is little difficult compared to organic chemistry .	2.875273802070887

If we talk about the utility of conversion for an organic chemist which deals with the small molecules in 98 percent conversion may be good enough , but for a polymer chemist , 98 percent conversion might give you only a degree of polymerization of 50 .	2.8502626758416603

So , if you have to improve or increase their molecular weight , you have to take your reaction for longer and longer which makes it more difficult for a polymer chemist .	3.5604068995812246

We also in that kinetic polymerization proved the theory of equal reactivity of functional group .	2.9770347368761074

Then we went on and studied how the degrees of polymerization would vary with equilibrium constant in a closed system , and we found that the importance of equilibrium constant .	3.0001859576610967

In that case , if you want to build high molecular weight in a closed system without removing the condensate out of the polymerization medium , then your k value , the value of the equilibrium constant has to be quite high to build a descent enough molecular weight which is that is why , it is never practiced .	4.010564568242209

The step polymerization is never practiced in a closed system is always done where you take out the condensate from the reaction medium and in continuation , we found that we understood that it is not always possible to take out 100 percent of the condensate which is produced , getting produced in the reaction .	3.3101388999065824

So , we found the quantity of relations between the amount of condensate present at the end of the reaction with the degrees of polymerization in that along with its relational equilibrium constant , and we have seen that unless we have a quite high value of equilibrium constant , we have to go down the residual value of the condensate to a very low level to build a higher molecular weight .	3.5834312673552446

If we cannot take out the condensate from the reaction medium , such a way , such a high level , so that the residual level of the condensate in the polymerized medium is low , for whatever reason .	3.130626940967455

Then we have to design the monomers such a way that the equilibrium constant is pushed up or the reactivity increases .	3.901808633863501

In that case , we can afford to leave more amount of condensate molecules in the polymerization medium in order to build high enough molecular weight .	3.3222216719591433

We also studied what are the strategies for controlling molecular weight in a step polymerization and two recommended strategies are either , one should use a slight excess of the one of the two bi - functional monomer or a slight amount of a chain stopper which is nothing but a mono - functional group .	3.203295160085867

Now , what we planned to study in this lecture is continuation of the strategies and now , we in this lecture would quantify the relation .	3.2650580425216313

That means , how much excess we use , the term slight excess , so how much excess you should use for your target molecular weight or how much mono - functional monomer you should have for a target molecular weight .	2.8549006732864917

And then we also learnt molecular distribution among the chains which are formed in step polymerization , and then calculate MW and poly dispersed index and then at the end , we will compare between cyclization and linear polymerization .	2.846887069199594

So , let us begin with where we left in the last lecture .	3.53905959719754

Now , we know that degrees of polymerization , the first degrees of polymerization is given by the number of monomer group or functional groups at the beginning number of molecules at the beginning and by the number of groups at time t .	4.592636711006259

Now , let us consider a case where we have this system AA and BB with slight excess of BBB .	3.356009251852365

This is present in slight excess .	7.852175447857773

So , define a ratio which is imbalanced ratio or which is the moles of AA number of BB .	4.000290395260607

Now , r is defined in such a way that it is always less than equals to 1 .	4.11691236198443

It will never be more than 1 .	6.202211487900913

So , the monomer which is present , this should come as a denominator , so that r is always less than equals to 1 .	2.8745459723229128

So , what you need to find ?	7.661057023647228

The molecular weight or degrees of polymerization .	7.061162180422096

We have to find N 0 and N .	6.009511716619804

If N A is the number of functional group present at the beginning at t is equal to 0 and N B is a number of functional groups of B present at t is equal to 0 , so what are the total number of a molecule at t is equal to 0 ?	3.9312723622035106

Total number of molecule is N A by 2 because each molecules has two functional groups and total number of BB molecules is given by N B by 2 .	3.83560363606584

Now , N B is r is N A by N B .	5.174053500780724

So , N B is N A by r 1 over 2 .	4.461949914342342

So , total molecules at the beginning at t is equal to 0 or N 0 which is N 0 is N A by 2 number of AA molecules plus number of BB molecules N A bar r 1 by 2 , which gives plus 1 by r .	2.694967966485411

Clear ? Now , we have to find out this .	9.800602144638809

We know N 0 .	11.893960588112948

Now , we have to find out N which is the number of molecules at time t at some reaction if conversion is P .	4.120684405428987

So , number of a molecules reacted a functional group reacted is P into N A .	3.7480822034537717

So , number of B group reacted again .	5.019687358491793

Each A will react with one A will react with one B .	4.313581018593799

So , number of BB group will react , will be same as number of A group .	4.104781289153501

Is it clear ?	13.313419821494032

Because conversion is defined the fraction of functional group has reacted , in this case , A present in a small amount .	5.397625537848495

So , we will consider AA number of A groups reacted is fraction in the total present , initially P into P multiplied by N A .	2.8935869826930816

Now , each A group will react with one B group .	4.389500132908364

So , total number of B groups will react also this .	4.1083939836967955

So , how many of A is remaining ?	4.8606183973887385

So , remaining number of A group is earlier what N A .	3.6495916802139874

Now , it is N A into P .	5.561823225889123

It gives N A 1 minus P .	5.195763327357475

How many B groups remaining ?	6.297019577045731

Earlier was N B minus P N A .	4.24765226493201

Again , N B is N A by r P N A which gives us N A 1 by r minus P .	3.3981185643152108

So , this is the number of A groups remaining and this is the number of BB group , B group remaining .	4.159470246487142

So , total number of functional groups remaining unreacted is sum of these two .	3.8717319090548004

So , total number of functional groups unreacted is summation of these two .	4.387691106043739

I can take both together 1 minus P plus 1 r minus P gives us N A 1 plus 1 by r minus 2 P .	3.043323838572174

Now , each of these are the number of functional groups unreacted .	8.545817904997689

Each molecule has two functional groups at two ends .	5.04728777482923

So , how many of number of groups , number of molecules present now ?	4.799298771158177

So , N which is the number of molecules left over , each molecules which is left over now in the polymerization medium which have two functional groups .	4.0383279777606935

So , if you divide the total number of functional groups unreacted by 2 , it will give you the number of molecules left .	4.434382372472405

So , N is N A by 2 , 1 plus 1 by r minus 2 p .	3.839917635550159

So , x n bar is N 0 by N , which means N A by 2 1 plus 1 by r divided by N A by 2 , 1 plus 1 r minus 2 P which leads to 1 plus r 1 plus r minus 2 r P .	3.0658615407131458

So , that is the expression which relates the number of average molecular weight with r , which is ratio of the moles of two bi - functional monomers present in the system at the beginning , where r is defined such a way that it is always less than equals to 1 and P is the conversion which is defined as the fraction of the functional groups which is present in a smaller quantity as reacted .	3.989695765952817

Now , if I plot this , how does it look ?	4.473625372007137

So , it will look something like this , where this is the direction of PP is 1 in this case , and the other curves are for lower P which means for a given r , you take any of the r here .	4.022669521648662

As you increase P , molecular weight goes up which is expected and for a given P for any of this , if you consider any of this curve .	4.459951059878483

As you increase r , if you go close to tri - symmetric , you will increase the molecular weight .	3.5254815779271893

So , the ideal scenario of working is somewhere here , where your r is close to 1 and P is close to 1 .	2.879542928693891

That will give you the highest molecular you can achieve .	5.903788018636892

If in any of these two factors , if r is somewhere here , then the matter what is a conversion level ?	4.084775587625019

You cannot reach high molecular weight .	5.830835871591036

It will stop here same as if your P is low .	3.817665483340959

So , to A for a successful step polymerization , successful by mean in A by successful , I mean to build a high molecular at you have to have a condition , where r is also close to 1 .	2.9697763998980977

You can only know the concentration of each other , the moles of each of the monomers and the functional groups if they are pure enough .	5.243442023118915

If there are impurities present in your monomers , then you do not know , you are not sure what is the actual mole fraction or mole of the functional groups which restricts that you must have very pure monomer in order to get a successful step polymers and also at the same time , your reactor should be high enough , so that you can take out your condensate such extreme that you can push your conversion up to P .	3.1536708849533075

Now , sometimes it is difficult to quantify the P where you cannot take out the halicut giving the reaction and determine the functional group present .	4.112321337751072

So , by which you can determine the conversion .	8.026848455452743

So , what is typically done ?	6.081300291755231

You do your reaction best possible way and that is your limitation .	4.616343199150945

So , that is the maximum you can go and if your reactions system is good , your reactor is good , your vacuum system is good .	3.2215363007324394

Then you can hope that you will be , your P would be close to 1 .	3.572158397457712

Then you can control your molecular weight and you can target your molecular weight by adjusting the ratio between two monomer or the fixing the value of r .	4.697772894204258

If you consider P as 1 , if you make your P is 1 , then x n would be 1 plus r , 1 minus r .	3.168362638136839

This is typically done .	8.366727910788963

You do your reaction best possible way as best you can do and hope that P is close to 1 and you can choose r in at the beginning , so that you can target x n accordingly and there is another case when r is 1 x n would give us back the original equation where we started with one is to one ratio of the two functional , two bi - functional groups .	3.2025627908059584

Now , there is a second strategy we discussed .	5.774446857115753

Type 2 that was earlier was type 1 .	5.310554747926437

Type 2 where we said that we can control the molecular weight by adding a mono - functional group , mono - functional compound or monomer substance whatever .	3.836972704491572

Now , let us take A , as situation where we have saved AAAA B type molecules lose some excess B or a AA type BB type plus some excess B .	2.363615276438984

You can use the expression which we will get it for the simple , any of this simple scenario where you have B or AA BB .	4.130139855472816

One is to one plus these things plus some mono - functional monomer which is chain stopper .	3.9199684732826454

In that case also , you can use the same expression which we got in the last page .	4.933056709879676

In that case also , you can use the same expression .	5.800341870196143

Only difference is that in this case , r is defined as N A plus N B plus 2 N B dash .	4.102097770247099

The same expression can be used for this scenario as well .	5.425508948994539

What is scenario where you have either A or D or 1 is to 1 A B plus some excess d .	3.0969707405339806

In this case , the dash is the mole fact , number of moles of the molecular mono - functional group having B .	3.7191605616702472

You might question what is the origin of these two ?	6.575433436703874

That is because this has same effect as excess BB .	3.9528389573219234

These are same effect of a x is presence of a excess bi - functional monomer to equate these two is added compensate this .	2.728666757526385

So , now , with this formula , you can use , you can target a molecular weight .	4.340740386217394

You can start with a one is to one A and B .	5.08744189251264

These two monomers , A and B and then add slight amount of this mono functional group and target a certain molecular weight using this expression , where r is defined as this .	3.6121186887057295

What is the advantage of this mono functional group ?	5.089224623989938

If you remember , in this case using mono - functional group , the insert cap with non - functional group and when you use the other strategy , the type one where you have one of the groups excess is still has virtually date polymers , but there you have functional , same functional group present in both the sides .	2.9754636994581682

When you use first strategy , you have same functional group present in both the sides , so that they do not interrupt with each other , react with each other , but you still have functional groups .	3.2733907743488513

So , in case there is in future , when you take this polymer for other reaction , if there are any impurities unlikely present which might react with this functional group , you might land up in a problem scenario whereas if you have a mono - functional or chain stopper , the insert cap with non - functional group .	2.7227485413726193

So , it will not react .	10.649933791288694

That is only the advantage in this case , but in this advantage , you have two , have an extra molecule in the reaction .	4.407790712464215

We will move to the next topic of molecular weight distribution .	4.723609158294674

Now , you know that the product of a polymerization is a mixture of different chain links .	5.931247758037689

So , in any polymerization reaction , you at the end of the reaction , you have a distribution which content similar molecular .	3.75006852460506

Now , in the step molecular , how the distribution looks ?	4.272302402921696

We will try to get some information , some prediction from statistics .	3.3571218290801537

See whether we can estimate , we can predict what would be the molecular with distribution , both numbers average and weight average , weight fraction and distribution of the molecules present .	2.9905279552171584

Now , let us , we have to consider or we have to find what the number of fraction is or say probability of finding a chain with x mar x structure units .	3.6953409026410973

If we can find the probability of all x or x mar , then we can surely get the distribution .	3.5889071130747827

So , to generalize , let us try to find what the probability of finding a chain in the reaction medium with the x bar is .	3.2181151020523466

Now , you consider a reaction of A plus BB type or say AB type and consider this is present in one is to one .	3.480834038002081

This following statistics was first done by Flory .	3.961657961302095

So , this distribution will guess is known as Flory distribution .	3.829698322463379

Now , how do you get this probability in x bar ?	3.9300706329923076

X bar means x n is x x bar .	4.977414936511805

If a chain which has x number of structure units which means , this is a polymer of this x .	5.330847551752285

Now , how many molecules are there in x mar ?	4.8516220291015975

X is the number of structure units .	6.9784885383599935

So , number of a group will be also x .	6.338819908889293

Now , out of this x number of a groups , one is at the end unreacted , and x minus 1 have reacted to form linkages .	3.739853472074944

See , if x mar at a , which one is the end which is free and x minus 1 is the number of a functional group as which is reacted .	4.012964215974072

Now , what is the probability of finding one free A group ?	4.071414429639611

If P is the conversion probability of one free A group is 1 minus P , means unreacted probability of one free A group .	2.7677480076603924

So , what is the property of two A group ?	5.107418727376338

Reactant P into P or P square .	5.036797563324423

3 A group reactant is P cube .	4.210948188539398

So , in x mar , we have x minus 1 A group which is reactant .	3.708471315322804

So , in x minus 1 x mar , a probability of x minus 1 A group reacted is P to the power x minus 1 .	2.7937029061130256

So , in case of x mar which has one free one , free A group and x minus 1 A group which is reacted to probability of finding such x mar is given by 1 minus P .	3.026563708212233

The product of these two probability is x minus 1 .	5.214400385368644

Now , what does it mean ?	4.592161118776184

The probability of finding a chain which has x structural unit which is nothing but the mole fraction , mole on number fraction of x mar which is say , N x 1 by P P to the power x minus 1 .	2.915837273404268

This is your mole fraction .	6.297614079127368

So , again I write mole fraction of x mar is given by 1 minus P P to the power x minus 1 .	3.662295902128562

Now , what is this mole fraction ?	5.463938670087517

It is the number of molecules having in mar .	5.784425110746282

So , N x is the number of molecules having in x mar in x structural units by total number of molecules present in that time is 1 minus P , so P to the power x minus 1 .	3.061049497313401

Now , what is N ?	8.018345358407267

N is the total number of molecules present at time t , which is given by the total number of molecule minus PN 0 has earlier , so N 0 1 minus P , where N 0 the number of monomers in the beginning .	3.9529016051077464

So , N x will be given by N 0 , 1 minus P square , P x minus 1 .	3.8873803911424023

So , this is the number of molecules present which have x mar in x number of x mar , which means number of molecules or changes present at any time having x number of structural units .	3.0544886655366543

How does it look ?	8.412816073792916

This distribution let us draw it again in next page .	3.5938113353802943

This is of the order of p .	6.311217653548357

So , if this is the duration of P which means at lower , this is the lowest P , this is the intermediate P and this is the highest P which means that at the lowest P , your polymer mixture has maximum number of molecules having low x .	4.232853475944083

That means , low number of consol group , it has intermediate conversion .	2.974946075561912

In that case also , the maximum number of group present or maximum number of molecules present is the molecules having lower number of structural units in the chain .	3.6164367305774103

If we increase the conversion further , then also the maximum of the number of chains having small number of functional groups , small number of structural units and maximum , but this difference comes down as we increase p .	3.314883772174934

So , what does it mean is that in any case of state polymerization , in any point of time whether you say small conversion or high conversion , what is the number of molecules which is present in maximum are the monomers because mono mass has the least number of structure units .	2.9236833015649877

Look at the distribution , the maximum mean on the left hand side which is the minimum of x .	3.7953587059575176

That means these are the monomers .	10.765384660118878

So , at any conversion region , whether it is a small low conversion , low conversion , medium conversion or high conversion , the reaction medium will have in number , fraction in number , not the width in number wise maximum number of monomer present .	2.8489873256130185

Now , the number of monomers will decrease as the conversion goes up , but even at very high concentration , there are significant numbers of monomers present in the reaction .	3.9573524542919367

So , the real polymers would be in the smallest number present in the reaction medium in case of numbers , but the numbers are not always very significant .	3.731398075358791

Weights are more significant than numbers .	5.29940912862301

So , how we will look at , how the weight fraction is distributed ?	4.660167065316359

How the weight fraction of this individual chain varies with x , which is the number of monomer present ?	4.660767122753106

So , weight fraction of x mar is the weight of all molecules of x mar divided by total weight of the mixture , if N x is the number of molecules having x structural units .	3.4600076840162144

So , N x is the number multiplied by x which is the number of structural unit present in one molecule .	3.871376162448332

X is the number of molecule number of structural unit present in one molecule and n x is the number of such molecules .	3.8078441596259935

So , total in N x in x and in average is the molecular width of the structural units .	3.076235629832868

So , this is the molecular structural units , this is the number of structural unit present in one chain and this is the number of such ends and you can sum total with it and sum up all such x mar , so all of x .	3.3864579770032313

So , we can get in x by x N x total .	4.11778225223221

This summation for all x s should give you N 0 total numbers of molecule and N x by N 0 .	2.76243234669624

We have seen earlier , we can put that value and we can get this expression .	4.461967041178911

So , that is your weight fraction .	5.754611688773003

So , weight fraction of x mar , it will be something like this .	4.456981387641325

This is the plot , the weight fraction as you can see from this distribution .	4.488416062072822

Unlike in case of number of fraction , you have always the maximum number was the lowest x , the chains having lowest x and one more being the least x 1 x .	2.945515829832733

In this case , there is distribution with the maximum .	4.3193916401878845

There is maximum and this maximum around comes above the x in bar number of average .	2.851029790135983

This x is where the maximum comes .	6.783523195609694

It is above the x in bar and this is again with increasing P .	4.601460337771226

So , this is the least P and this is your intermediate P and this is your highest P .	4.59886565090453

So , as I expected with increasing P , you have x also increases , molecular poly molecular also increases , but if you plot with fraction , you can see this is not the monomer features .	3.0401414255917736

These are the timer dimer which is present in maximum number .	3.8985218092185616

What is present in maximum , it corresponds to the polymer chain which is having average degrees of polymers .	5.266944151584187

So , the weight , if you take all the chains and plot the weight fraction in five maximum , where x is equals to or to the average degrees of polymerization .	3.538508894263423

When I increase number , if we talk about number fraction , it is the lower monomer , dimmer or trimmer .	3.852784373101795

Their weight could be more because monomers , dimmers presents in not significantly contribute any polymer properties in the weight which will contribute more in terms of polymer properties .	2.6586714054494274

See if you want to get the M M bar and number wise molecular weight and weight of molecular form , this distribution , you will get it .	4.013977121814351

We know the width number of fraction and weight fraction .	3.9177532028512805

We also know the expression of M n and M w M n .	5.070223964827255

We know X n bar multiplied by average molecular of the structural units and X n bar is mole fraction multiplied by the number multiplied by the number which is given by X n 0 1 minus P square P to the power of x minus 1 sum over x , and if you do this math , you will land up 1 minus 1 minus P M w is X w bar m average X w bar is weight fraction multiplied .	3.0280269275472396

There is number of fraction .	10.516282759045554

It is weight fraction .	9.362277298879427

So , u X is square 1 minus P square P X minus 1 and if you solve this , you will get , we get X bar is 1 plus P 1 minus P .	2.936223207630878

What is the process index which is given by M w bar by M n bar , same as X w bar X n bar is 1 plus P 1 minus P divided by 1 , 1 minus P which is given by 1 plus P .	3.5334959143168114

So , PDI is 1 plus P .	7.06865871569017

Why is it ?	14.067870616699622

So , as we have seen , I understood in last lectures , previous lectures that to make a high enough molecular weight which is useful for application P as to be very close to 1 .	3.104921524993542

If P is close to 1 , PDI is almost in every case is close to 2 .	3.3689494566397813

So , you cannot make a step polymerization of high molecular weight , where PDI is narrow .	4.428847880724967

1 , 1.2 , 1.3 that is not possible because do you remember what he have told that to make a high enough molecular width , you have to be having r is equal to 1 close to 1 .	3.6002988875837727

So , as P is close to 1 , if your half P to a lower level than no matter what is your r , no matter what is r , whether r is 1 , still you get lower molecular widths .	2.4403476183548967

So , if you have higher molecular width polymer , nobody can claim that he does not have narrow , very narrow distribution of 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.5 .	2.5948596399201067

That is not possible .	11.208312063768062

Whenever you make high molecular width by step polymerization , you are going to get poly dispersity of closed to 2 .	3.4465162574841157

So , without knowing both the molecular wise M n bar M n , if you know only of them and you have given the structures , one structure , if know that this is made by step polymerization , if you are given only one of them .	3.247802486931743

See if you have given M n has 10000 and a polymer is supplied to you , given you know the structure and from the structure you know that this is made by step polymers , then you even is 10000 .	3.8319691706582337

See in these cases say , 90 percentage or something and you also know PBI which is close to 2 .	3.0561605582681177

So , you know M w bar is close to 20000 .	4.542062376651443

So , from the single data of M n and the structure , you know all others P is close to 1 .	3.437816649518879

So , this should be clear now .	6.182344728159724

We have seen in last page that PDI is 1 plus P which is always close to 2 , or if the molecular weight is lower , it would be less than 2 .	3.7601650072933768

It can never be more than 2 because P cannot be more than 1 .	3.594891556558787

Anytime , at any point , P cannot be more than 1 .	4.861392795184687

So , P is very close to 2 , at most if your polymer molecular is low , it can be little lower than 2 .	3.8922571564778825

It can never be more than 2 .	5.302645861503158

So , theoretically , we have seen that it can never be 2 or more than 2 , but in practice , we find that after end of the polymerization reaction , if you do explanatory finally what is polymerization distribution , you find that it is slightly over 2 .	3.770171560221743

It can only be possible if there are side reactions which are producing smaller molecules in excess .	4.2285955603173315

Now , if any distributions have more smaller molecules than expected M w and M n , both will come down and as you know that smaller molecules effect more than M n than M w .	2.8204116179598886

So , your PDI will go down .	5.255494210148246

That means , it will be more broader .	8.15255732443831

How can , what are the types of side reactions ?	6.501706047792009

We have one major side reaction is which is present in most of the polymerization step .	5.447808851254753

Polymerization side reaction is cyclization .	8.14246936246652

Now , you understood why we are bringing this concept of cyclization .	3.741404861984309

As you have seen that most , as I said that most of the case , PDI of polymer after the reaction found to be little lower to in practice .	3.6340574717933642

That means , they are side product which are small molecular in nature which affect M M mode than M w , which means the N w by M n goes up .	2.741826920959169

So , PDI goes up little lower .	5.9590393818700225

Now , how can cyclization product if you consider molecules , they are both functional in both the sides .	3.4456364117126586

If you have hydroxy acid , then it can form a cyclic product like the monomer .	4.158717425930003

These are the intra molecular reactions in the monomers of AB type .	4.321856322230368

If you have monomers like AA type or BB type , then you have the intra molecular reaction cyclization in monomers .	3.5953357919591777

It is not possible because both the sides , you have a di acid , di caboxly acid , both the side you have a two carboxyl acid or di - hydroxyl compound and both the side , two hydroxyl acid group .	3.2488702644601752

So , monomers , they cannot cyclize intra molecularly , but cannot they cyclize at all .	2.921510096119417

They can in a because in a , they have two defined functional group at both the sides .	2.8312898676586857

So , we are talking about reaction between di hydroxyl and di di - hydroxyl compound and Indus intermediare stages .	2.738331146078734

Then you have hydroxy acids or hydroxy amine and then they can intra molecularly react and cyclize .	2.913872680458803

Let us see some example , generic example .	4.664087041993788

See AA BB type structure , this can cyclize to give like this .	3.0261753007108805

Even in case of AB type of monomer also , you can also have cyclization at an intermediate step .	4.786879975826335

So , these are showing the possibilities of cyclization .	4.343113144760718

If you have AB type monomers , then in monomeric stage also , it can intra molecularly cyclize .	2.756192906585015

If you have BA or BB type monomer , it can only cyclize at stage .	2.8919958832615205

Now , what is the tendency of a monomer to cyclize , participate in cyclization reaction compared to a linear reaction ?	4.276931720659072

If you have intermediate molecule like this , it can take part in a intra molecular cyclization reaction or it can also as usual , what you just learnt all the time , it can take out linear reactions to make high molecular polymer .	3.435951271443907

Now , it is desirable fast , it is desirable that this take part in linear polymers and not in cyclization .	3.416354727165917

If its cyclic form cycles , then it will form low molecular .	4.537544636901004

It will come out from the reaction and those will contribute to the lower molecular fraction , and to increase your poly dispersity , you cannot avoid the cyclic formation .	3.504029954320277

They are always present in the cyclic formation .	7.420641817500157

That is the reason why your poly dispersity goes up little over because you cannot avoid completely .	3.233502198181396

Formation of cyclic in a step polymerization is always present in little amount , so that its contribution to your PDI to be little lower .	2.9237743958692484

Now , what is the comparison ?	8.585422676573286

If you compare a cyclization process and the linear polymerization process , what are the tendencies ?	4.307500957750866

Now , if I compare between cyclization tendency verses linear polymerization tendency , now this depends upon both kinetic factor as well as thermodynamic factor .	2.9622207178202995

Thermodynamic factor comes from the stability of the ring size .	5.522364572823806

Now , when they form cyclic , when this form cyclic , it is always forming a ring and the size of the ring determine whether it will form in thermodynamically , it will form the formation or not .	3.241226016690359

If I go from a ring size to 3 to 4 , strain comes down .	3.427263846622792

Then 5 and again strain comes down .	4.845188708745773

6 is the least .	9.903710101700376

If I go up again from 7 member ring , again it goes up 8 , the strain goes up and then again it starts up to 13 .	3.128283218268962

It goes up and for instance after 13 , it comes down in strain .	4.196643272552309

So , if you talk about the compare ring size , then 6 , 14 and larger are the more stable rings .	3.202232897477465

Then the 5 and 5 ring size within 7 to 13 and the least stable is the 3 to 4 ring size .	2.8779851562209307

This is applicable for methylene groups and also , this ether are the backbone , the cycling and ether other carboxylic groups , carbonic groups .	2.524656831794437

Now , what will be discussion in the next class is take this forward , this ring size and we know that what the thermilyn factor is .	3.4415470133701045

The ring size determines the stability , and of course guide the tendency of your formation .	3.423979172516551

We will talk about kinetic factor in next class , in next lecture and then compare between what are the factors we should take care to reduce the cyclic formation as desire that this should have minimum amount of the cyclic in the polymer mixture , but as I said that we cannot have word cyclic formation .	2.900094088811382

So , that is the reason why you always get a a little lower to.. ... So , we will come back and start with and repeat this thermionic factor and a little bit , and then start the kinetic factor , and also talk about reaction conditions which defers the cyclic formation which is responsible for cyclic formation .	2.641017816587555

See you .	26.433810405359914

So far we have seen the influence of substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration or activator concentration on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction and they very strongly influence the catalytic behavior .	3.8539045564039474

Besides the substrates , inhibitors or activators two major environmental parameters which form or which constitute a bulk environment for the enzyme catalyzed reactions are pH and temperature .	2.758211350042497

Today we will be looking at these environmental parameters and how they influence the whole enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.4674377578586046

As you know enzymes are primarily very complex molecules and we had also looked into the complexity of the situation as regards to their catalyses , as regards to their specificity .	2.4972925002564104

The whole effect of pH and temperature therefore is not based on a single interaction like in the case of substrate or an inhibitor which is usually their effect on the reaction rate and the formation of dynamic complexes with the enzyme .	3.5926030187990614

In the case of pH and temperature the effects are multidimensional .	4.23475896406624

If you look at the pH effects you will notice that the pH influences enzyme reaction rates or enzyme reaction in general in a number of ways .	3.5805202698637584

The first and probably the most common feature could be the shift in equilibrium .	3.816993737888656

A number of enzyme catalyzed reactions that are reversible in nature primarily can be affected strongly by the pH , particularly the reaction like oxidoreductases .	3.195756353336195

If you take for example ethanol oxidization by alcohol dehydrogenase , forming acetaldehyde plus NADH plus H .	2.369036350677439

If you consider such a reaction you will notice that the concentration of hydrogen ions at any given pH can be regulated by the pH of the environment .	3.7915573251836627

By taking a buffered reaction mixture at a higher pH the concentration of hydrogen ions in the reaction mixture can be maintained at a very low level and the reaction can be driven in the forward direction .	3.534937312212059

Similarly if you reduce the concentration or the pH of the buffer in which the reaction takes place you can also bring down the equilibrium constant of the reaction .	4.256255656686921

If you consider this reaction although this reaction may have an optimum pH of , say for example , seven that means the rate of reaction is maximum at pH seven .	3.6324670006140787

But at pH seven , the reaction may not be driven very largely to the forward direction .	3.340207118195125

To be able to drive the reaction in the forward direction you need to adjust the pH so that the concentration of hydrogen ions can be reduced and therefore the reaction can be driven .	4.560573753029254

But the reaction might proceed at a very slow pace .	4.32717491410553

For example if you consider let us say pH nine .	4.976123670650001

Just alter the pH value .	7.3550896776342904

At pH nine the concentration of hydrogen ions will be hundred fold less , one hundredth of at pH seven and therefore you can drive the reaction as far as the equilibrium constant is concerned but at a very slow rate .	3.27155323498946

The shift in the equilibrium must be considered in terms of the rate .	5.614047829463191

So pH optimum or the equilibrium constant they are two issues which are to be considered independently .	3.9885711043261383

The second issue which is important in the case of pH effects is the stability of the protein confirmation .	4.21676621662334

As we all know that proteins retain their native confirmation within a limited pH range , because electrostatic interactions , which are a major force , non - covalent force are involved in the confirmation of the enzyme molecule .	2.599387226942363

If you shift that pH very often gross alterations occur often called as denaturation .	2.71806894635583

That means if there is an irreversible change in the confirmation then the enzyme is considered to have been deactivated .	4.726674930839205

We assumed the stability behaviour of enzymes .	4.620937952112896

In earlier stabilization studies we saw that a two stage model is the most accepted model for enzyme which consists of two steps , native protein going into an unfolded form and then irreversible inactivation to in - active enzyme .	2.3491842415033686

While the first step is reversible , the second step is irreversible and always the approach to stabilize and a similar effect is noted even for the pH .	2.788668701981574

Initially if the pH alteration is mild if you go beyond a certain level of pH change you might observe only reversible change and therefore the enzyme can be brought back to a native confirmation but if you further change the pH it might undergo to a irreversible inactivation and which may not be possible to bring back .	2.7070355490250932

The third role is in which the hydrogen ions play a role for either inhibitor or an activator .	3.4401434222039606

Wherever we are considering the involvement of ionisable substrates or the products that are formed which are ionisable , the hydrogen ions will play the role of an inhibitor or an activator .	2.9865241009291292

The fourth role of pH and probably one of the most important role which pH plays and which directly influences the rate of reaction is the ionization of the amino acid residues on enzyme active sites .	3.431851374813307

On the enzyme active sites a number of amino acid residues are present which are charged and these charged residues will ionize as a function of pH of the bulk environment and therefore it is required that they are at a particular ionization state in which the enzyme offers the maximum reaction velocity .	3.44924798261274

That means if there is a particular state of ionization of the active site of the amino acid involved , whatever fraction of the enzymes present in that fraction will constitute the catalytically functional enzyme .	3.7749250160658745

This ionization state will affect the maximum reaction velocity of the enzyme because ultimately you are affecting the total effective enzyme concentration which is in the true ionisable state of the system .	3.53148883996503

The last effect is due to ionization of substrate .	4.926981294196348

Although many of the substrates which are used in the enzyme reactions may be neutral , like ethanol or any other non - ionisable substrate , many of them also contain carboxylic group or hydroxyl group or amino group .	3.185633996803535

The ionization of substrate will influence the Km value of the enzyme .	5.060934467544516

The Km value will be altered because the apparent concentration of substrate which we are providing is not the true substrate concentration which is interacting with the enzyme and it may be lesser than that because the ionized state which is catalytically acceptable to enzyme is less than that .	3.6695530560306655

Therefore the pH effects must be looked into all these parameters or all these effects in a comprehensive manner .	3.122143762738433

Practically it may be difficult to consider all these effects in one go because sometimes they may be counteracting and so the net effect of what we notice is a very complex phenomenon , all over .	3.370732524116218

To understand the behavior and to derive certain meaningful conclusions one may create or design experiments in which only one of the pH effect is considered prominent and in fact the pH effect studies have contributed a lot to understand the identification of the amino acid residues in the active site in conjunction with the chemical modification studies .	2.689003683047509

Common technique to study the amino acid residues or identify the amino acid residues at the enzyme active site is by chemical modification of the different function of the groups that are present .	4.062034480128824

In addition to that their effect on the ionization behavior and ultimately the rate effect and putting both the things together can give you a confirmatory result or conclusion on the identification of the amino acid residues on the reaction rate .	2.6718518636419684

We will consider today mainly the ionization of amino acid residues on the active site which is primarily a major factor which influences the typical reaction profile that you are familiar with of the effect of pH on the enzyme .	3.1668472758580255

You often end up getting a variety of profiles when we study pH .	3.7115238421585452

When we study the enzyme reaction rate as the function of pH we get a variety of profiles .	4.92342430111471

For example in the first case in the diagram , in part a you notice that , the effect of pH is shown against the percentage rate of the maximum value .	3.708614442620997

Maximum value means the optimum pH , the optimum or the maximum at which it shows and with a single ionisable residue on the active site .	3.251665570554558

When there is only one ionisable residue with the pKa value of nine initially at a lower pH value the enzyme activity remains constant and when you go to higher pH value the rate falls and subsequently at an extreme value it comes down to zero .	2.5844732973194833

We will determine the pKa values and their role .	5.359291069389397

In the second case you notice that it may be a much broad based pH profile .	4.224476232019244

A profile like this shows maximum value over a pH range , not a very broad range but at least in one or two units .	3.373724882095751

This reflects probably the presence of two ionisable amino acid residues , one acidic and one basic on the enzyme active site and the profile is like this .	3.39832200144926

Of the two amino acid residues one has pKa three and one has pKa ten , just a typical profile which you get .	3.020269384450681

Most commonly you may end up getting a profile of a very sharp maximum and we are familiar with the typical terminology called bell shaped curve .	3.080930425855295

You have very sharp pH optimum which is considered at the peak of this .	3.113223001187741

Such a situation is a special case of this broad profile in the sense that here the pKa value of the two ionisable groups are distinct apart , one at three and another at ten .	3.0675179426042014

Their ionization doesn ’ t really influence each other so much .	3.73691928843081

One of the amino acid is ionizing and the other is not in a very highly ionised state and therefore you got a broad pH .	3.805854052321156

But in case the pKa value of the two ionisable groups are close enough that means at a particular pH , the ionization of one amino acid residue does also ionize , to different extent , the other amino acid residue .	3.1327819043983185

In that case they will tend to look as if both the ionizations result are merged and you get a sharp profile because here the pKa values of the two amino acid residues are seven and eight which are pretty close .	2.8584226589742388

So that is a kind of scenario you get .	5.045890411470096

It is a comparatively simplistic situation .	4.966052838008428

In practice in many of the enzymes for practical applications , you might end up with a profile like this which consists of not ionization of one or two amino acid residues but more than two , may be five , may be seven and may be six .	2.8957014065727225

The net pH profile may be a sum total of all the effects and they can be broken down into linear segments and each linear segment will represent the ionization of one of the amino acid residues .	3.39222291875337

The effect of pH on the reaction velocity must be considered as a parameter on the rate of reaction .	4.431219222116922

Let us take the simplest case .	5.538337521123895

The ionization of the residue can be considered as K EH E - + H + That is the neutral enzyme , which is a protonated enzyme can dissociate into the negatively charged enzyme and the protons with the ionization constant of K .	3.2393278655187863

Under these circumstances , the concentration of EH will be EH = E - .H + / K and the total enzyme concentration E0 = EH + E - E0 = EH + K.EH / H + = EH ( 1 + K / H + ) E0 EH = = E0.H + / H + + K ( 1 + K / H + ) If we assume that EH is the catalytically active form and not the negatively charged enzyme , then the substrate will bind only to EH .	2.875295989105967

EH + S EHS EH + P If you assume that EH is the catalytically active form that is the enzyme is present in the form of EH , in that case the Vm , the maximum reaction velocity will be Vm = k.E0.H + / H + + k The enzyme is present in the form of EH and therefore you multiply k , the rate constant k here , with the concentration of EH .	3.5536087099973885

If the total enzyme is present in the form of EH that is Vmtrue .	4.834315968110539

That is the maximum reaction velocity which one can achieve at some pH when predominantly all the enzyme E0 is present in the form of EH .	3.655047897089265

That is a true Vm .	7.436012544795113

Vmtrue / ( 1 + k / H + ) You arrive at a relation where by you see the Vm is the affected by a factor 1 + k / H + In such a case if you plot the profile of pH , which is negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration , with log of Vm you end up with a profile like this .	3.134364504718222

If you take logarithm on both sides logVm = log Vmtrue – log ( 1 + k / H + ) If you consider the extreme conditions that is when hydrogen ion concentration is much , much greater than the ionization constant or in the other words the pH is smaller than pK , then log Vm = log Vmtrue .	2.834845695673363

That means it remains constant .	6.176339225467271

Only when the hydrogen ion concentration becomes smaller than k or pH becomes greater than pk , log Vm = log Vmtrue – log k + log H + The hydrogen ion concentration will influence , Vm will be decreased and you get a downward fall .	2.4606147403175704

If you extrapolate these two lines , at the point where pH and pK are identical you will get a point of intersection at which the two lines will merge .	2.8892381559125435

Another option available to us is instead of EH , E - or the negatively charged enzyme is the active form .	3.155329915293718

If the E - is the active form , not the neutral enzyme in that case although … .	4.35628894164302

will be identical but the rate profile will be different .	5.185949034863234

The rate profile will be Vm = k E0 K / H + + K You can again analyze the same way and the profile obtained will be reverse of this and you get pK value .	3.1615222304188926

Only difference is the direction of the pH effect will be changed and the analyses will remain on the identical lines .	2.7096797791706657

That is a very simplistic situation only to appreciate and understand the effect of ionization of the amino acid residue on the reaction rate .	3.9455190971429377

But if you take a little more realistic case that instead of having one amino acid residue , we have two amino acid residues or two ionisable residues there might be more than two other amino acid residues which are involved in the active site but they may be non - polar .	3.5945446479081387

If there are two ionisable residues involved , one containing a carboxylic group and amino group and if you add acid or base or change the pH , the ionization state of the two residues will change .	3.5866143097514964

Both groups being in the ionized form , if it is the active form then you can see the effect of addition of acid or base in this equilibrium .	4.24008255831731

If the middle thing is the ionisable form , then you can also predict that the left hand side form of the enzyme EH2 is more reduced form than the EH and then EH is more reduced than E .	2.9482769312372112

If this EH is the form which is catalytically active , that means it binds to S the substrate and forms the product .	3.4799073060838426

To analyze the system we have taken , we consider that there are three dissociation constants involved .	4.358791175316609

One is the ionization of the two amino acid residues .	6.2611618051053695

If we represent Ka and Kb as the ionization constant of the two residues that are involved and the third we are taking as Km which is the dissociation constant of the enzyme substrate complex .	3.8998563908717983

We define it as analogous to the dissociation constant , Km .	4.510829213835956

In such a case the typical profile that will be obtained of pH will be a bell shaped curve with the pH optimum at the middle of it which we consider as the typical profile and Vm .	2.9276285419774744

If we look at the analyses of such a system you will notice that you can write the three different equilibrium and get the concentrations of individual enzyme species that are present in the three states .	4.380688073899426

Let us consider the first one , the case of EHS that is the interaction of the EH with the substrate and we can write the concentration of EHS EHS = EH.S / Km I am omitting the parenthesis to denote the concentration term .	4.500772461292413

These terms represent the concentration terms.Similarly if you look at EH2 EH2 = EH .	4.31774769535183

H + / Kb E = Ka.EH / H + This is based on the equilibrium dissociation of the three species .	3.9451595219129856

Our total enzyme concentration E0 will be equal to E0 = E + EH + EH2 + EHS The total enzyme is present in four different species : the free enzyme , the partially reduced , fully reduced and the substrate bound which is involved in binding only with the EH .	2.969510668641746

Therefore we can substitute the value EH E0 = EH { 1 + Ka / H + + H / Kb + S / Km } From this if we put the expression in the term for EHS EHS = E0.S / Km { 1 + Ka / H + + H / Kb + S / Km } or reaction velocity will be v = k [ EHS ] That is the concentration of the enzyme substrate complex which has bound the doubly ionized enzyme complex .	2.8712368193807967

V = k [ EHS ] = k.E0.S Km ( 1 + Ka / H + + H / Kb ) + S The whole effect of the change of pH that is the hydrogen ion concentration is influenced by this parameter in the parenthesis .	3.441595590073876

The parameter in the parenthesis influences or depicts the effect of pH on the reaction velocity and this parameter will pass through minima as hydrogen ion concentration is varied and you can get the minimum value by simply differentiating it with respect to hydrogen ion concentration .	3.209980053919869

If you denote this function as F dF / dH + = 1 / kb – ka / ( H + ) 2 = 0 If you equate it to zero you get 1 / kb = ka / ( H + ) 2 Hydrogen ion concentration gives you this function F to be a minimum .	2.5465270902068005

When this function is minimum your reaction velocity will be maximum and that will be given by ( H + ) m = vka.kb You get the minimum value of this function .	3.396841108737215

This is not the minimum hydrogen ion concentration but is the value of this function F which is minimum .	4.094857876583369

The rate will pass through a maximum when the function is minimum and at this concentration of hydrogen ion the reaction velocity will pass through a maximum .	3.744059175085274

You can use this expression to denote to the effect of k , the effect of ionization constant of two amino acid residues on the reaction velocity of the enzyme catalyzed reaction .	4.052087410058552

You can increase on the complexity by taking more and more number of ionization .	3.9879305591852265

It is not necessary that there will be always one negatively charged and one positively charged amino acid residue .	3.2622645403152757

There might be more than one of each of the type .	6.154638447204855

The only difference you will notice in that case is that the pH optimum profile will not be a very sharp bell shape but can be broken down into different stages or segments , each of the segment representing the ionization state of that particular segment .	3.303401313876741

It will be important to notice that the sharpness of the profile of the pH versus reaction rate will also depend on the proximity at which the pK value of the different amino acid residues lie .	3.8297491010787748

Very often just by a pH profile if the number of amino acid residues involved are not very large , one can guess the likely number of amino acid residues involved and knowing the pK value of different amino acids that are known , that are likely to be present one can make judgment whether a particular ionisable amino acid residues present or not .	2.706090239903179

That is the effect of pH as far as the ionization of enzyme active sites are involved .	4.983852408753472

The next stage which is again very important is to look at the ionization of substrates because it is not only important that the enzyme may ionize it may also be very commonly feasible that when you are handling the charged substrate molecules and very often the protein itself is a substrate which is a poly electrolyte and it will have many functional groups which will be ionisable .	3.806514066483516

Depending on the number of charged functional groups on the substrate the situation might be more and more complex .	4.930371949573107

But just to consider two simple model cases let us consider a substrate which in its unionized form is not catalytically active but is able to bind to the enzyme for catalytic function .	3.0131097959905158

The substrate itself is not catalytically active , it is only enzyme which is a catalytically active component and if suppose we assume a simplistic case wherein the substrate can ionize and give you a protonated form of substrate with the ionization constant of K .	2.815134827123454

S + E ES E + P K SH + You can arrive at the rate expression for such a system as Vm .	4.008023633318805

S V0 = Km ( 1 + H + / K ) + S You will notice that in such a case the net effect of the ionization of substrate is an increase in the Km value .	4.483469127169038

The Km value is modified to the true Km K ’ m = Km ( 1 + H + / K ) The expression is analogous to that of competitive inhibition .	3.161822767772725

That means in such a case the hydrogen ion acts as a competitive inhibitor for the substrate .	4.0248773792261385

The neutral substrate and protonated substrate is the reactive form which is acceptable to the enzyme .	3.077461764028146

Part of the substrate which got protonated by binding with the hydrogen ions becomes a dead end complex as happened in the case of a competitive inhibitor and therefore you get a similar profile which gives you a Km value .	3.745128477245022

So the effect of pH on the Km value can be noted to look at the pattern of inhibition .	4.487450373262826

In the second case you assume that it is the protonated form which is catalytically acceptable to the enzyme function .	4.503050382120194

SH + + E ESH + E + PH + S In such a case although the analysis will remain the same only the form of the reaction velocity will change .	3.6051032817900497

Again there will be a difference in the Km value you will again get an apparent Km .	4.877910423816418

But the magnitude of apparent Km will be slightly different and will be given by V0 = Vm.S / Km ( 1 + K / H + ) S If you analyze the two apparent Km terms , in this case this one and in this case Km .	3.746103577566273

( 1 + K / H + ) S .	11.551275531576406

You will notice that only at extreme values of hydrogen ion concentration there will be difference in the behavior of the enzyme .	4.390090931769757

Otherwise they will be almost similar kind of behavior .	6.075206981429769

In both the cases you will notice that the ionization of substrate influences the Km value of the enzyme that has increased and this increase is in magnitude dependent upon the fraction of the substrate which is present in the form of the substrate molecule which is acceptable to the enzyme and ionization substrate .	4.254138811050434

Similarly if there are more than one ionisable groups in the case of a substrate a similar analyses can be arrived at .	4.3204595845456675

We should consider SH + because that is the form of substrate concentration which is the total substrate concentration for all practical purposes .	6.13340089862302

V0 = Vm.S / Km ( 1 + K / H + ) S We have seen so for that this pH effects are quite complex and all the parameter that are influenced by pH cannot be considered in one go .	3.0923741457835487

They need to be considered in isolation one by one and depending upon the information we want to collect .	4.481080078387692

So life is very simple .	7.0581690526812535

You conduct the enzyme catalyzed reaction in a buffered medium with different pH values and get the reaction rate and use the one which has the maximum value .	4.122747942698988

Sometimes you want to identify the amino acid residue at the active site .	5.29372546513383

This needs to be confirmed again by chemical modification studies .	4.069619794246623

Therefore such an analysis can give you an indication but may not be able to give you confirmed data .	4.228079210769398

The second environmental parameter which is very important is temperature .	6.1862127022022735

Like pH , temperature is also a multidimensional parameter which influences different aspects of the enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.700415152079542

Probably the very first step at which the temperature influences is the interaction of enzyme substrate complex , an equilibrium process , you know is a reversible equilibrium process .	3.632802888128811

The key parameter which represents the ES interaction , in our case we have noted at least for typical Michaelis Menten kinetics , is the Km Michaelis Menten constant .	3.0240480593961157

The temperature will influence the effect on K and the study of effect of temperature on the Km is a very interesting issue because it gives you lot of insight into the thermodynamic aspects of the enzyme substrate binding like the enthalpic and entropic parameters involved .	3.331207835272043

If you look at the classical Vant hoff equation for an equilibrium process , the equilibrium process here is km E + S ES with the dissociation constant of Km .	2.873392541445996

The free energy change will be equal to ?	6.005250155733188

G0 = RT ln Km Note that I have purposely removed the minus term from here as Km is not the equilibrium constant , is dissociation constant almost like inverse of that and which again also can be equated to ?	2.7498119529724123

H - T ?	17.85118031035053

S . I think all of you should be familiar that conventionally in biochemical systems we are used to use these terms with prime and I am sure that you must have understood the meaning of prime for the thermodynamic parameters in biochemical system .	2.517192637751467

? G ’ = RT ln Km = ?	5.516654736097053

H ’ - T ?	17.85118031035053

S ’ That is only for the sake of convention but the laws of thermodynamics do apply and the Vant hoff equation is also applicable , the second law of thermodynamics is also applicable and therefore you can write ln Km = ?	2.5825381419336315

H / RT – ?	31.89905182029785

S / R So a very simple situation arrives that if you determine the Km values for an enzyme catalyzed reaction experimentally at a number of temperatures and then make a plot between ln Km and 1 / T you end up in a straight line with a slope of ?	3.0088536062011237

H / R .	32.85273996062923

So one can easily get the magnitude of ?	6.904659658546036

H , the enthalpy change during the enzyme substrate binding .	5.692737454616663

Also the sign of slope I have shown only the positive slope it could end up in a negative slope also .	3.1232538464565844

The sign also indicates whether the enzyme substrate binding is exothermic or endothermic .	3.868144918690842

You can get a thermodynamic picture of the enzyme substrate binding and also you will notice that the interaction on the X - axis will give you ?	4.478306176210583

S / ?	147.25705392522275

H . If you put this equal to zero you get ?	6.319219070421918

H / ?	146.0627786467701

S as the interaction point and thereby you can calculate both ?	4.624770819352828

H and ?	21.71589967746665

S for a given enzyme catalyzed reaction by studying the effect of temperature on the Km value of a reaction .	5.53051453079822

So the effect on K2 that is the turn over number is primarily almost like any other chemical reaction .	3.8170001428023173

The third effect on the enzyme catalyzed reaction of the temperature is the deactivation of enzymes .	6.747741433096526

Just like in the case of pH effects on the deactivation of enzyme , temperature is also mediated by inactivation process .	3.3215235018504563

That means as long as you are keeping the temperature range in the environment of the reaction within a close range the enzyme may be functional but if the temperature ranges are shifted drastically to the higher side the deactivation occurs and a very broad picture of deactivation has been discussed earlier which is represented by a first order deactivation kinetics where you can define as E = E0 e - Kd.t Here also you can make a first order kinetics analysis that is your ln E / E0 versus time will give you a profile with a negative slope and slope will be equal to - Kd and this will be a function of temperature .	2.8814708824409565

The magnitude of the deactivation constant will be a function of temperature .	5.872639132727609

One must look at the deactivation effect , the third effect and the second effect that is on the K2 as opposite forces .	3.686379344681487

While with the increasing temperature on the one side the reaction rate increases , the deactivation constant also increases .	4.210884064005704

The practical operational temperatures of enzyme reactions therefore are chosen on the basis of not just the optimum temperature that means the optimum temperature for the enzyme reaction rate but also taking into account the deactivation kinetics because the interest will be on the total productivity of the enzyme per unit enzyme rather than only initial reaction rates .	3.2074870124044743

All these studies are based on initial reaction rate but if you look at the practical application that will be based on total productivity and both the effects the deactivation as well as increase of reaction rate with temperature should be considered .	3.556284385924209

So to summarize we have seen the effect of two major environmental parameters which are experienced by the enzyme catalyzed reaction the first is pH .	4.247849090819117

The effect is quite complex and the effect can be considered on the basis of the shift in the equilibrium or on the ionization of either substrate molecule or on the enzyme active sites .	3.8774052144739906

The other parameter which is temperature also influences in a multiple fashion .	3.5990100409636754

It influences to increase the reaction rate in a pattern of the Arrhenius plot .	4.453122456564806

It also influences the deactivation of the enzyme molecule and finally a very important tool which it provides is to understand the thermodynamic status of the enzyme substrate interaction and one can by computing the value of Km at different temperatures one can get a picture of the ?	3.751568464306826

H and ?	21.71589967746665

S for the given enzyme catalyzed reaction .	6.032693275698197

Welcome back to this course in Polymer Chemistry .	3.1606825266091074

And today we will start how discussion in mechanical properties , which may be continued in next lecture as well and then , eventually we will discuss very briefly the other properties .	3.460565523411117

Now , this lecture and probably , next one or two lectures is not directly related to chemistry for say but , as a polymer chemist , if we if you are hired in a company then , you must know the polymer properties .	3.1833709572303697

Because , this is when you doing some polymer synthesis and characterizing them , finally you are targeting for some application and applications are linked with polymer properties .	2.3926201340475934

So , unless you do not know , what the power polymer properties means , how their evaluated and how they are related structure how they are related to the polymers structures then , it is difficult for you to design a new polymer and then , synthesis it .	3.195613687307505

So , it is very very need a basic need to understand the polymer properties at least in brief .	3.7099350199552763

And out of the polymer properties , I will spend more time on basically , we will discuss in detail about mechanical properties because , as you will see in next one or two lectures , this is the most important properties of the polymers .	4.293332988278192

And some other properties like thermal properties , environmental properties , they are linked to the mechanical properties .	3.0390236305770073

Linked means , what I mean that basically , the polymers are exposed or be in contact with heat or some environment conditions and then , the properties mechanical properties of polymers are followed according after exposure .	3.40905252834032

So , mechanical properties is the most property for polymer and I will discussed the mechanical properties in the detailed .	3.763372749148964

And I will very briefly covered the other properties like thermal , environmental , barriers , surface , electrical , optical , fire resistances , etc .	2.514106166791702

And before I start discussion on polymer properties , I want to very briefly talk about polymer processing .	4.225258255503178

Mainly because , the fact that , till now we have understand or we have gain the knowledge of polymer resins , you know how to synthesis them , how to characterize them .	2.8619731906090795

And then finally , these polymers will be applied in product , in applications and the step which converts the polymer resins into product is called processing .	2.8294912737799365

So , polymer properties are tested on the final product or final specimens so , unless we know the polymer processing step , their it there will be gap between resins and a product or applications .	2.938896460285443

So , this is again not directly related to chemistry but , you must know the basic nomenclatures and basic techniques , how which how by which the polymer is converted from a resin to a product for final applications .	2.723630527771268

So , let us start our discussion on polymer processing very briefly as I said , polymer processing can be done from a melt state or a solution state .	3.0008955021750485

Melt state , there are two three techniques mainly , extrusion , molding , thermoforming , by which the polymer converted to final specimen .	3.221139857744479

And for solutions , we can do casting is applied to making films and spinning is applied to both from polymer melts or polymer solutions for example , making fibers .	2.5481133345646034

Now , as I as I said that , melt from the polymer processing from melt state are mainly three types , we can mainly two types , we can say extrusion and molding .	2.8554103562425266

Extrusion is basically a step where , a compounding is mixing is done between the polymer resin and other other additives or reinforcement colorant and all these things .	2.6917420206423492

And then , taken to the molding state to give the final part or extrusion techniques can be used for making final parts like , very simple parts like film , profiles like pipes , rods and so on .	2.507679836197233

Moldings are are these , these are techniques of molding injection molding , blow molding , these are applied for thermoplastics and compression molding transfer molding design applied for thermo sets .	2.2818806177996263

So , what I will do , I will discuss this techniques important techniques like compounding , injection molding , blow molding , compression molding in very briefly .	2.6098590748610477

So that , you know you have some idea about how this extrusion molding is done .	4.439647718321003

So , how the as the overview of the main processing technique , there is a formulation where , this poly solid polymer is added .	2.973024599410852

And if you need additives , invariably we need really , that the 100 percent polymer is used for any formulation .	2.931132525939213

There will be invariably some additives added and they can be mixed well and if there are color master batch or some other master batch , they can be added here .	3.5800632989242005

So , this is the formulation and then , they are taken to melt processing steps like extrusion , it could be two step extrusion followed by molding or it can be just extrusion step .	3.167258472339741

And then , you finally get a the specimen where , some post processing steps are done like for example , if you are making a DVD then , the polymers are taken and then , extruded and finally , injection molded to a DVD form .	2.7227775422062876

And then , the company takes it and put the data in it and put the decoration and finally , sell it as a product .	2.743258623086341

In this stage , you can add other agents like foaming agents , which makes the final product foam product or you can add the other fillers and reinforcement material .	3.127044035257276

Typically , amorphous materials are processed melt process at T g plus sum or 80 to 140 degree centigrade temperature .	3.011625183322999

Higher and semi crystalline materials as processed at melting temperature placid , temperature 20 to 50 degree centigrade .	2.5524900290064036

Talk about briefly extrusion process , extrusion process as said , this is steady step process , this is continuous process having high productivity and it is used for making low complexity of parts like pipes sheets and so on .	2.492612592407505

This is a schematic or structure or a scheme of a extruder where extrusion is made , a one screw is shown , this is a single screw extruder .	2.478480400410798

That in some other cases , there could be two screw , which makes that instrument as twin screw extruder .	3.07274851297396

It has different zones having different temperature within increasingly , if you go from left hand side to a right hand side , the temperature generally increases and becomes steady somewhere in this region .	2.7891659376070184

And there is a dye , by which the molten polymers are extruded out and cooled with the real cooled or cooled in a in water medium , it could be cooled in a both the ways .	2.890395130773669

So , basically in the first part , all the ingredients are added and those ingredient are mixed here , molten in this part , melted in this part and mixed thoroughly and as the screw rotates , the melt is pushed forward .	2.3079475412053734

And finally , the melting is comp and melting and mixing is completed here and this this polymer melt is comes out from this dye .	2.8905850470206396

And if you have different shape dye like sheets , you can form sheets or pipes here itself or if you want to use this material for for further injection molding or some other molding , still you can cut into granules in small pieces and make them as a granules .	2.5382918281138096

Some other large companies , large polymer manufacturing companies , they just mix all this ingredients and extrude the polymer and make granules and sell those granules in big bags .	2.1650634780008358

And those are purchased by the final or original equipment manufacturer , they just take those granules and do the molding at there there into make the final product .	2.474928856848359

So , the function of extruder is to pump the high viscosity melt , also mixing the ingredient .	2.9268859321326453

Sometimes , if you add some , if deliberately wants some reactions to happen at higher temperature then , you can do in extruder .	3.5975597810455064

Sometimes , they are unwillingly or unwantedly some reaction also take place inside extruder .	2.883231733671864

And if there are volatile materials then , you can add some vacuum somewhere here to remove those volatiles materials .	3.3445203714706926

So , going to molding and molding is a cyclic transient process and is molding can be used for making complicated three dimensional parts , as I said it could be injection molding , blow molding , thermo forming .	2.8283129661974646

Injection molding is done mainly for thermo plastic material and it is similar to the extruder machine , there is a hopper where , you add the gremial polymer material and some additives , which act as a mold release agent .	3.1481666576531513

So that , after the part is formed , it can easily taken out from the mold , there is screws , it basically melts and mix those those polymers with additives here and this screw by rotating it , takes it forward .	2.398334488921756

There is a cylinder somewhere here , which basically pushes the polymer melt mix polymer melt in the mold and when molding is done , it is cooled and the part is ejected from this material this mold .	2.3332148958500554

Other techniques like extrusion blow molding where , the extruded polymer is placed in form a tubular profile is like this , this is a tubular profile and it is placed inside the mold .	3.452147489377181

And then , the inherent gas is injected through to inflate this tubular profile , till it get the shape of the mold .	2.4731282730275477

And finally , it is cooled here and the part is taken out , it is used mainly for bottles , hallow materials like bottles and similar materials .	2.8178848307044366

Similarly , in in adjacent to extrusion blow molding , injection blow molding also can be used where , this parison , this tubular profile is basically injected in this mold .	2.6376346797655876

And the rest of the steps are similar where , it the molds inflated with the inner gas and then , cooled and the part is taken out .	2.5167298013117474

So , injection blow molding and extrusion blow molding is similar , except the the way this parish ion is inserted in the mold so , this scheme is shown here .	2.514110902816794

The other techniques in very briefly thermo forming where , sheets is first extruded and then , it is heated to a temperature just below the , just heated to the softening temperature then , vacuum is applied .	2.4305971736708196

So that , this sheet is formed thermo can be thermo formed in the shape of the mold similarly , in injection molding machine , this is the place where the polymer melt is accumulated .	2.902270893117477

Now , in this case , if you can if you want to make a foamed polymer , you can add some inner gases here .	4.30345796322977

And then , make a short short which means , you can inject less material , which was supposed to be filling the entire mold .	2.760162641467978

So , if then what happens , this this material fill the mold with this gas in a foam a foam in between .	2.562429854581214

So , the surface would be in contact with the mold , it will be plain which would not have any bubbles , it will be smooth but , the bulk will have lots of inner gases as a foam so , it will so , you get a foamy material .	3.0071232396869227

So , thermoset polymers are molded using compression molding basically , as you know that , thermo thermoset polymers cannot be flown at higher temperature , they are material .	2.7434322651279954

So , they do not flow .	8.364784039678701

So , basically what you do is , you basically melt in a cavity and then , with particular shape mold , you just compress them and leave it .	2.4141368848542215

You close this , compress them and close it and once it cools , you can take out this mold and you can form this shaped article or part so , this is in brief about compression molding .	3.097955164486023

So now , you have seen , how this polymers are converted to the articles now , we will discuss about the properties of this final polymer and this properties are very essential for the applications .	3.5467076247078837

So , you have to make a proper polymer article or part having particular properties so that , you can sustain or you can apply to the application you are looking for .	3.452758576785844

And as I said that , I will be mainly I will be discussing the mechanical properties in in details , basic some basic terms in , when you talk about mechanical properties , stress you know that , it is force divided by the area upon which the force acts .	3.1933771390218975

So , it is a stress is given by force so , stress is forced by area .	3.9816177548939438

And strain is basically is the change in dimension change in dimension divided by the original dimension .	4.1522625093156185

So , strain percentage is given by d L by L into 100 so , that is the strain percentage .	4.431372290676228

We will be using this stress and strain very very frequently in coming coming discussion .	3.002738782623285

Now , mechanical probabilities is polymers , mechanical prosperities is related to deformation , what happened in when you apply some force or a stress to polymeric material or plastic material , it it deforms .	2.64125701961789

And the deformation is basically a but , what we discussed , what we talked about mechanical properties .	5.200570642608909

So , you first know , how many different types of deformation that a polymer undergo , under applied stress or applied force .	3.1742858497034927

So , there could be three types mainly , one is elastic deformation you probably know that , we say that , elastic deformation happen when a material returns to its original state , releasing the stresses on releasing the stresses , following the same stress strain curve that it to deformation .	2.376757566805715

So , while if you apply stress it will deform , if you release the stress it should come back in the same path , stressed and come original state then , we called this is a linear this is elastic deformation .	3.1360810476106433

It could be linear , if the stress strain behavior is linear , it goes from here and come back in the same path .	3.181514796218118

It is linear behavior and if it is something like that , it goes in this way and come back then , it is a nonlinear , nonlinear elastic behavior .	3.8666058453209606

Second is your inelastic deformation where , basically inelastic behavior what happened , if you give the stress , give the force , the energy stored in the material .	2.580271230313741

So , when you release stress , that energy is given back so , you gave you get back to original state .	2.4194385653153057

Whereas , in case of inelastic deformation , when we apply the energy or apply some force , the energy is lost .	3.094580610288093

So , it may deform permanently or even if come back to the original state , it it do not follow the same path .	3.046980382116618

So , in inelastic deformation , loss of energy happens and if at all it returns to the original state then , it does in a different route .	2.778706673731213

It could be two different type , visco elastic which may and may not shows permanent deformation and there is another type of deformation deformation where , the plastic deformation where , permanent deformation happen .	2.5478175969389016

So , plastic deformation is said to have occurred when the deform material is permanently unable to return to it is initial state and yield point is that where , the materials start showing the plastic deformation .	2.190491257473893

What happen to in at the molecular level , in inelastic during elastic registration , the the resistance to deform the resistance to deformation can happen both intermolecular .	2.718807130889101

The polymer chains are you know entangle to each other so , polymers , the resistance to deform may happen , because of presence of the other polymer chain segment in the near viscidity .	3.5191890394266476

Or it could be due to resistance , due to intra molecular because , the polymer chains are entangle so , different parts of the chain are linked .	3.6843284663110984

So , they they they resist times they resist to give a resistance to deformation , elasticity elastomer you know elastomers are very very elastic .	2.6310439429920787

So , it elongates quite high and entropy change on the deformation is the dominant factor in to the resistance of deformation .	3.365002626264093

In case of elastomer , the polymers are you know having conformation , quailed type conformation in in normal case .	3.3344668603829843

So , if you want to stretch , deform it like in elastomer what happen , this conformation entropy is a lost .	2.574940896038712

So , when you release that stress to gain that conformation entropy , it comes back to it is original state .	2.5453772735934224

So , that is what this entropy change and deformation is the dominant contribution in the to the resistance of the deformation in case of elastic material .	3.163636830208623

And in case of plastic deformation in the polymers especially , in case in case of amorphous polymers , cooperative motion at of a large number of chain segments happen together , large say number of chain segments corporally move with each other .	2.7732500542538574

And in case of semi crystalline polymer , deformation at crystallographic scale crystal state so , polymer chains might sleep with respect in the direction of the applied stress or it could move in the perpendicular director direction .	2.401074578372701

And there the could be deformation in case of semi crystalline polymer could be deformation in in the amorphous region or in case of spur light region .	3.5164173058847927

So , we will we we talking about elastic deformation and plastic deformation , elastic deformation where on a plain releasing the stress , the sample comes up back to the original state and in case of plastic deformation , it it come it come does not come back .	2.5186218399412312

The polymer sample on releasing the applied stress , it does not come back to the original state , there is a permanent deformation .	3.729975431058667

So , you test the mechanical properties , the different types of test can be conducted , static states test like a tensile compressive shear properties , which gives stress and curves , stiffness and strength and toughness of polymeric material .	2.3602643954838545

We impact test , which is basically high strength test done it very fast fast by by applying stress in a fast rate and it can give the impact strength , the resistance of about plastic material to a impact can be given by impact stress and time dependence of polymer material can be done from a creep test .	2.7329483592186015

Similarly , the other test like dynamic mechanical test , fatigue test , hardness , abrasion resistance and these are all , within what this test mean are written here .	2.533809647231843

You can just read fatigue test is for determining the lifetime or durability , hardness is the resistance to surface indentation , abrasion resistance is the weightless by a fine or abrader or the finely divided abrasive particle .	2.015805272966446

But , for these lecture , we will mainly talk about first two test , which are used very often and rest of the test will not be covered because the , because of lack of time , this will not be covered in this lecture .	3.394853541635691

We talking about deformation of polymer material , that this deformation can be bring about in a polymer material in different ways .	3.2213606161175106

Like tensile , you can pull a polymer specimen , you can compress them , which gives us a compressive deformation .	2.7874190882058305

You can shear then and you can shear in rotational way as well , you can bend them , bend a polymer by applying stress in in the middle of the polymer where , the two sides are supported .	3.10283667831378

You can apply this stress or or so that , there is this deformation happen oscillatory , that stress can be applied or the deformation can happen in a tensile way or a shear shear manner .	2.7254729685409305

So , that is that is the way , oscillation oscillatory deformation is done so , basically it you must know this basic deformation modes to understand the subsequent test and polymer mechanical properties .	2.902368402523014

So , let us talk about tensile testing , what is done , you take a specimen something like this geometry , which is like a tumbleset geometry or we call dog bone geometry in a crude way .	2.810547266378525

And then , fix this two side and pull them applied force from both the sides , sample is deform , the deformation is done in the constant rate and the amount of stress is required for keeping that constant rate of deformation is monitored .	2.6254368172001388

So , stress is plotted against time or stress now remember , in this test and all subsequent polymer property testing , you must… Because , this test is very much dependent on the size , shape of the specimen and the environment , what you when you are doing the test like temperature and relative humidity of the environment .	2.549267157207744

So , you must there are agencies which give like ASTM and ISO International Standard Organization or ASTM American in Standard Organization where basically , they give specific conditions , specific size of the and shape of the polymer specimen and the conditions .	2.392327716053299

So , we must when we testing , we must keep those condition intact to get the report is full or repeatable polymer property measurements .	2.5372178115381163

So , what is the typical stress strain curve look like , we can analyze a stress strain curve so , stress is plotted against strain and these curves basically shows , what are the possible effect or possible deformation in a sample .	2.801543247792986

This is this does not happen for all the sample but , this is shown here to so that , you know all the different terms and related to this tensile testing .	3.674472864563254

So , as you know , the first part is linear up to this point so , this part is elastic and you from this slope , you can get the elastic modulus of the material .	3.639928059926807

This is the proportional to the limit and this is the point where , yield happened yield means , sneaking happens in the sample .	3.6650122948640855

So , beyond this stress , beyond this strain , the polymer start deforming permanently so , up to this , is an elastic linear elastic limit and up to from here to here , it is nonlinear elastic limit .	2.550944861431835

So , you can if you deform up to this point and then , remove the stress , it will come back to the original state .	3.1987499990288955

But , beyond this yielding point , it will not come back to the original state so , permanent deformation happens so , this is a plastic .	3.7350678673118183

So , from this point to the further onwards , is a plastic deformation happening , below this elastic deformation is happening , this is called yield point .	2.6429893765199024

So , the corresponding stress is the yield stress and corresponding strain is the yield strain and on subsequent applying subsequent stress , subsequent straining , sometimes at the end , the stress might go a further thus because , strain hardening technique takes place , the chains are already stretched .	2.3814043024590283

So , for further stretching of the chains become difficult , polymer chains becomes difficult so , if you have more stress to give a given strain and this has strain hardening this is because , strain called strain hardening and this slopes sometimes can get give us the strain hardening modulus .	2.5487671391905073

And this is the point where , polymer breaks , polymer fails , the basically failed apart and this is the corresponding stress is called the ultimate stress and the strain is the ultimate strain , which is the strain or elongation at at break .	3.1385340970568083

So , please do remember all this terminologies , this yield point , this is final break point so , elongation at the break , ultimate strain and this slope , the initial slope gives us the elastic modulus .	2.455267007067606

Some terms related to tensile testing , stiffness usually stiffness related to the product of the modulus and the movement of inertia .	3.486538742060807

So , basically , if you have a specimen , you try to bend them and if you resist , you feel resistance to bending you call this , the material is stiff .	3.04545552416894

So , that is depends upon the movement of inertia , which is given by the shape and geometry of the specimen .	3.6704232163718973

And if you compare between difference material and out of same sample specimen then , higher the modulus obviously , higher will be the stiffness , higher will be the resistance to bend .	3.0064585261430588

So , this modulus is the material property whereas , the movement of inertia captures the contributed of structure design and the shape on the stiffness .	2.504899343351185

So , if you compare same structural design and the shape materials , the higher the elastic modulus or with the stiffness , rigidity is the ability to carry stress without changing dimension , basically .	2.615894966938667

Similar to stiffness , and the magnitude of the elastic modulus is a measure of rigidity , elasticity is the ability to undergo reversible deformation .	3.256964591636067

Means , where that , after the stress is released , it should come back to the original state that is , what mean by the reversible deformation .	3.3779457837255027

And or carry a stress without suffering permanent deformation and it is indicated by the elastic limit or the yield point , beyond yield point the elasticity the sample actually undergoes permanent deformation .	2.308477680633249

Strength , is the load , is the sustain it is the ability to sustain dead load so , basically ultimate strain is the stress it it can capture or it can hold before it breaks and yield stress , yield strength is basically the stress , you it can it can take up before it yields .	2.720847164817813

And toughness is basically , the energy spent , the entire energy is spent for causing the material fail , is basically the the area under those stressed in curve in case of a tensile testing .	2.9597613706969175

I just showed one example in in last page of one type of stressed in curve is basically capture everything , all the possible deformation of terminologies .	2.60293818616133

But , in typically , one particular polymer can have one type of this deformation behavior for example , polymer gels have this type of soft and weak stressed in behavior , this is hard and brittle .	2.614640403861865

So , it breaks at a low strain elongation value similar , this is hard and strong , this is strong and tough and this is hard and tough and example of these are given in this table .	2.813080999461536

So , hard means higher elastic modulus where , soft means low elastic modulus and weak can brittle is basically given by the elongational breaks .	2.6853681410089116

So , higher high elongation means toughness value is high so , these are different types of stress tensile possible for different polymers , the examples are given here .	2.8782569639443136

Some more examples with the names of the polymers this nylon , PVC , HDPE , LDPE now , just to compare the values of the polymers with metals .	3.546269761221626

So , where in the applications , where you require very high loading high loading applications where basically , the part has to hold a very high load .	3.5094151448748465

Basically , polymer does not does not fair well in those applications so , metal is the choice of material in those applications .	2.853381123903028

Elongation is where , polymers win over metals , the polymers can elongate in case of a elongation typically , polymers elongate much more than the metals .	3.1995836372014117

Now , the stress strain curve we a talked about and the modulus or the stiffness and the rigidity and your elongation at break , all those parameters or properties can actually depend both on the temperature and the time .	2.786192927677436

The strain rate physically , how fast you applying the stress or how fast you straining the polymeric material for example , this is a stress strain curve for poly methyl methacrylate .	3.276790657719784

And as you can see the stress strain behavior changes at a lower temperature , it becomes hard and brittle .	3.4123178619498806

Whereas , at higher temperature , it become soft and a and a along with a ductile , which means it the the sample can be elongated , is more tough in that that sense .	2.7080426503801442

Similarly , if you change the strain rate , strain rates means the the the d L by a L value , the fast you are the fast you are changing this applying strain , see your the first deformation will change the stress strain behavior .	2.392882690238185

If the that the strain rate is higher , it will become closer to is become to hard and brittle and if you do the deformations , it is slow phase then , it will become more soft and ductile or tough in nature .	3.081786337152058

So , basically you must know that , the mechanical properties of polymers this for examples stress strain curve and other mechanical properties always as well , very much depended on the temperature of the experiments .	3.1686554057263203

So , and and finally , where this material is applied so , definitely if you measure a modules or stiffness at say 40 degree centigrade and find your material is sustaining the load .	2.451620514916923

You probably may not used that at higher temperature like 80 degree you might see failure , because of decrease in the modules of the material .	2.9005085093447374

So that , you must know that , all the mechanical properties depends on depend on the temperature of the experiment or the application and and the how fast the deformation is taking place , how how fast the load is applied .	3.7034166504776302

So , just again showing the same thing , with increasing temperature , the sample become stuff and ductile .	3.1319305650717215

With reducing temperature , becomes brittle and rigid whereas , applying high strain rate , makes the sample brittle and rigid , very slow strain rate mix the sample tough and ductile .	2.2804926570570445

The modulus which means , the stiffness or rigidity , very much depends on the temperature , as I said so , this is the example , how the modules changes with temperature .	4.370954668145521

As we know that , the polymers have undergo glass transition and melting transition at at a adiabatic temperature for example , if you pure amorphous material undergo go glass transition T g whereas , semi crystallized polymers undergo both glass transition and a melting at T g and T m subsequently .	2.534271058201464

So , the so , the modulus also changes with temperature generally , molecular modulus decreases with increasing temperature of the thermoplastics and at T g and T m , the modulus decreases suddenly at T x added T g and T m .	2.439173784996219

And with increasing crystalinity , in case of semi semi crystallized polymers , with increasing crystalinity modulus goes up and also for the cross link polymer with increasing degree of the cross linking , the modulus goes up .	3.123201276296035

So , with different so , this is a plot of lock elastic modulus with temperature , which shows that , different regions of polymer elasticity .	3.3378064771541487

Whereas , below T g , it is glassy , which have higher elastic modulus and more it is more of a elastic behavior is like a elastic behavior then , immediately after the T g it is becomes soft but , because of high viscosity thus , the polymer chains steel cannot move fast each other very easily .	2.83762931680197

And this we talking about a amorphous material and at the highly temperature is , it behaves like a polymer liquid .	3.3030547784746327

So , is basically flow state , this example of real polymers , nylon 6 is semi crystalline polymer , is basically drops after T g , it drops very fast and then , after T m this is T m and after T m , it is becomes polymer that , if the elastic modules becomes very low after T m .	2.702177155020745

So , this is T g here , drop in modulus and T m , drastic drastic drop in modulus in case of a semi crystalline polymer .	3.5644710138430487

This is a pure amorphous polymers so , the drop in elastic modulus or modulus after T g and this is a rubber with cross linking .	3.8021532275992636

So , it drops after T g but , because of the cross linking , if the presence of the cross linking , the elastic modulus or modulus does not drop significantly after after a value .	3.423667355379845

So , this is what I was discussing in in just a minute that , with a for a semi crystalline polymer with increasing crystalinity at the modules goes up elastic modules goes up .	2.5936949671524654

Where , in case of cross linking , material with cross linking , the the material the less modulus can goes up further with cross linking .	3.112315374925992

So , this is the way , you can basically change , if your semi crystalline material , you can increase the crystalinity to increase the load bearing capacity of the material .	3.458215034462053

And you can also crosslink to increase the load bearing capacity , even at the higher temperature but then , cross link brings other problem like a possibility with it .	2.7575330010957915

This is another mechanical property testing , we just discuss all last few minutes about tensile basically , the stresses is applied in a longitudinal direction .	2.5456594985145493

Here , in case of flexible or bending testing is basically bending mode where , the stress applied .	3.5685102394123716

It could be three point bending test or four point bending test , is like stresses or strain is applied in bending direction so , higher the modulus as bending will be lower .	2.4562218163879623

We can we just talk about impact testing , impact basically is a dynamic loading at short duration .	2.7012546982619363

You know we we know about impact like , if you have just a glass then , if you hammer it , it breaks which means , the glass has a very low impact property .	3.6491777543181576

Glass like we talk about glass then , if you keep a glass and you can put a load on it , it does not break .	4.38846366550787

So , the modulus of glass is high because , the strain rate or the the stresses are applied is not in a higher rate you know , very fast rate .	3.4705495359471694

But , when you impact , apply a hammer on that , you are applying the stress in a much faster rate so , a strain in the material at the very faster rate and the material performs poorly , the glass perform poorly .	2.909156576049458

So , the impact behavior of glass is basically poor so , the glass impact behavior and modulus does not always match with each other .	2.3996369543291793

The testing itself is different modulus , we talk about the slow deformation that , we do deformation as we apply strain in a much slower rate compared to a impact testing .	3.1155185718879963

So , impact testing is a dynamical load of short duration and very high strain and at high very high strain rate .	3.2010002120622874

And the performance of thermoplastic or plastic material depends upon the stress rate obviously , the higher you know it depends up on how we are applying the stress , loading rate , what is the amount of force , temperature and sample geometry and nature of the sample of course .	3.0706664025992922

There are different types of impact test available , which you know the you have to if you are applying a designing any you have made a polymer and you want to test , you have molded it and you want to test impact properties then , you need to know the target application .	3.8317795227917286

Depending upon the target application , you choose the type of impact test should be done on that sample .	3.2154008568620083

So , different types of test possible namely , Charpy , Notched Izod , Falling dart , tensile and and drop test and they are basically different and different types of test .	3.023280636251422

Charpy test is is shown here schematically , you have sample , the sample is clamped both the sides and there is a notched in the other side and you hammer it and find out the energy require to break the material .	3.198985417681147

In case of Notched Izod test , you clamp this specimen upto the notch , this both side and hammer on the top part .	2.1701982716165484

So , this material , this specimen breaks from the notch and the amount of energy require will to break this material will be the Notched Izod impact energy .	2.872353753021937

Sometimes , the test is done without the notch where , we say just Izod testing or notched izod impact testing .	2.393011290691826

In case of tensile testing , the tensile bar , a dog bone type specimen or a dumbbell type specimen is fixed one side and another side with a pendulum is is hit the hammered from both the side .	2.0405305365105044

So , actually the deformation or the strain happen in a tensile way , in a longitudinal way , uniaxial if this uniaxial to.. ... So , the only difference between this and a tensile stress strain test that , here the strain is applied or the stress is applied much higher rate .	2.3273185293232714

So , the amount of energy required to break this bar is called impact strain .	3.4399700226604337

Another testing where , a load is just applied of actually , allowed to drop from a height on a circular disk and it can break this material or it can make a hole , just hole depending upon the energy .	2.8381030269247915

And the amount of energy required to break this material is again is impact energy for this plate .	3.3919530146907624

And drop test is basically , take the specimen and drop from a certain height , which is very complex complex phenomena .	3.1369384715595894

Now , we know different test impact test , tensile test , now we need to find out , what is the relations between the polymer structure and and the properties .	3.7188557753286617

Now , as I said that , temperature is a very important thing so , we can compare for a same same polymer , same chemical nature at a same temperature , elastic modulus will increase with crystallinity .	3.0385164223247934

As we have seen earlier that , for a particular semi crystalline polymer at a , if we want to increase the elastic modulus at a particular temperature , you increase the crystallinity .	4.689329165639114

Basically , with increase the soft disperse phase , the modulus increases .	3.4539531123941987

If there is a orientation , the chains if the chains are already oriented little bit obviously , if you want to deform further , you have to you have to stretch the polymer chains further .	4.213123656464826

Which means , what I am telling that , this is the original state now , if I already have stretched and aligned oriented little bit then obviously , aligning from or stretching reforming from this state will be much easier compared to aligning from or deforming longitudinally form this state .	2.6322755374868505

So , orientation increases modulus and for a semi crystalline polymer , if we increase a some glassy additives like glass fibers in the amorphous region then , basically the elastic modulus goes up .	2.929363119235765

Flexible modulus increase with elastic modulus generally , generally flexible modulus and elastic modulus go hand in hand .	2.478971437179377

So , with increase in elastic modulus of a plastic material , flexible modulus or bending modulus also go up .	3.1830450745854466

Yield strength that is , the stress where , yielding starts or permanent deformation starts and again with yield strength decrease , if we add some plasticizer or a solvent molecule obviously , the yielding yield stress comes down .	2.495242622175642

It increases elastic modulus , it increases with crystallinity of a semi crystalline polymer and if we add this glassy additives like glass fiber then , yield state increases .	2.8384882933326896

Elongational break decreases with increasing molecular weight and elongational break decreases with increases short change branching density of the polymer .	3.3159957625210725

And basically , we relate brittleness of a polymer with elongational break basically , when something elongate more we say , this less brittle and if does not elongate , we call that it is a brittle material .	2.988523103569087

In general , if we talk about different polymers , if you want to compare the mechanical properties of different polymer in general what happen .	4.332414617141759

If you have steep polymer back bone obviously , stretching it further or deforming it further is always difficult .	2.3881013427695654

Similarly , if it is stiff then , you cannot deform it you know , you cannot strain it much longer which means , the elongational break for a stiff polymer is low .	3.064700273498553

So , it breaks .	11.907895275594273

it is become brittle whereas , if you have flexible polymer chain obviously , it can absorb that energy and change it conformation .	3.588423802463923

So , in general , if you want to summarize , flexible back bone , lower modulus and strength , chain stiffness would have back bone or bulky side group increases the modulus and strength , and chain stiffness lower the impact strength and elongation would break .	2.373354897603463

Now , with this , I stop for this lecture , I will just continue the mechanical property in the next lecture with little more discussion .	3.671341756847774

And we will talk about some other , we will start discussion about some other properties in next lecture as well .	3.5662472249591173

The enzyme kinetics deals with a quantitative analysis of the effect of various parameters on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.8242151708844436

It involves molecular dynamics between the various species involved in the reaction .	3.8269546968601182

One of the principle species as you know is enzyme itself and the interaction of enzyme with all other chemical species that is the substrate , the product , if there is any inhibitor all those molecular species , dynamics of these inter relationship or interactions is involved in the study of enzyme kinetics .	3.098163040891444

One of the essential features for study of enzyme kinetics is the experimental data .	3.454991982139749

To start with any kinetic analysis one needs to initiate with some basic experimental observations and to take some experimental observations the key parameters that are usually involved in the study are the enzyme concentration , substrate concentration , product concentration , concentration of inhibitor or activator if there is one where as enzyme , substrate and product are the universal chemical species involved in the case of an enzyme catalyzed reactions .	2.8701704911925208

Then you have a set of environmental parameters like hydrogen ion concentration reflected in pH , or the temperature of reaction .	3.9689935255626008

Then in most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions , we assume the water concentration to be very large almost in excess and for most of the analytical purposes it is ignored .	3.763597669766226

But at least in two distinct cases where we are handling very high substrate concentrations of the order of say greater than 50 or 60 % weight by volume or in cases where we are carrying out reactions in the non polar medium , water activity also becomes a key parameter for study under enzyme kinetics because then it controls the rate of enzymatic reaction and therefore it must be taken into account .	3.0238561208814723

So when we talk of enzyme kinetics we are looking into the molecular dynamics of various species that are involved in the reaction , their interconversions and the effect of those inter conversions on the rate of reactions as a function of different parameters that are listed here .	3.283042108927285

There are three major constituents in any kinetic analysis .	4.133293471015757

As I mentioned earlier the first and probably the most important are the experimental data .	3.768040938782529

With the start of experimental data one assume certain mechanistic hypothesis that means how various molecules involved in the reaction are interacting and you propose some kind of a mechanistic hypothesis or in other words you can say in a simplistic term the sequence of reaction steps that are involved in converting substrate into product and based on these mechanistic hypothesis or reaction steps we arrive at a rate equation using mathematical analysis .	2.5471554366004376

If it befits the experimental data , if it predicts or gives you a close relationship with experimental data it is acceptable , both the rate equation as well as mechanistic hypothesis we have assumed are acceptable .	2.7853279155402486

If not we again go back to the mechanistic hypothesis modify it , revise it , in the light of the deviations and then again go back to a new rate equation and therefore such an analytical sequence continues till we are able to match our rate expression with the experimentally observed data .	2.4690291685468546

In a very simplistic term the rate equation is a mathematical expression that depicts the reaction process in terms of rate constants .	3.437175983817572

I think we must appreciate that the rate equation has a very new dimension in terms of rate constants .	4.545740795504125

A large number of rate constants might be involved depending on the number of reaction sequence steps and substrate and product and other chemical species if involved .	3.5380394737261094

It also serves as a link between experimentally observed data and the possible reaction sequence steps .	2.900147329771817

These three parameters or these three steps are the critical steps in study of any kinetic system and applies to also the enzyme kinetics .	2.7062935841018754

The second question that might emerge in your mind is why do we study enzyme kinetics ?	2.8531545244996086

What is the function ?	8.762354381826706

I think the first and foremost and probably the most trivial function that could be understood is to get a certain optimum set of parameters for carrying out the reaction .	2.9631240350364996

For example when we consider the optimum temperature of the reaction and the optimum pH for the reaction that is probably one of the primary objectives of establishing the whole kinetics analysis .	4.3272982697190585

As I mentioned you will always assume a mechanistic hypothesis to arrive at rate expression .	3.295539628274328

It also gives a number of inferences about reaction mechanisms and the current accepted rate expressions for enzyme catalyzed reactions involve a hypothesis where enzyme substrate complex has to be formed .	3.7862103369118056

It gives you a very big inference when we look at the reaction mechanism also and that becomes a very important part of the study of reaction mechanism itself .	4.046098757213366

It can also give you lot of insight into the biological phenomena , the kind of reactions that the enzymes carry out inside the cell at molecular level , their intercellular concentrations , their physiology , directions and regulation .	2.5356233779526636

Lot of issues about the function of the enzymes within the cell can be understood and inferred from the kinetic analysis of the enzyme .	4.032480675022907

Then from the point of view of biochemical engineers probably a very important requirement for enzyme kinetic study is to design enzyme reactors .	3.002628030979354

The design of enzyme reactors , like in the case of chemical reactors is based on kinetic pattern .	4.533670328940541

Finally from academic point of view I think the enzyme kinetics has also played a very important role in classification of the enzymes particularly when the same enzyme is obtained from different sources their kinetic characterization gives you a very good tool to distinguish between them and use them so that you can understand and identify the enzyme based on the kinetic characteristics .	3.13976380833245

We will probably talk when we will come to the actual kinetic aspects .	4.565908522498476

The third point which one must look at before studying the actual enzyme kinetics is some of the historical perspectives that have gone into the study of enzyme kinetics .	2.8522850119826066

The understanding in the mind of the scientists that there are some biological catalysts which catalyze a number of reactions particularly the key reaction which people have understood then thanks to the availability of alcoholic beverages that the yeast possesses some enzyme which hydrolysis sucrose into glucose .	2.3158313783732924

The first enzyme in the whole reaction sequence was invertase which hydrolyses sucrose into glucose and fructose and that was essentially the a key enzyme which people were ready to study .	2.6838477872158673

Many of the kinetic analysis in the early stages when I say early stages I am referring to the late 18th century or early 19th century when people tried to understand the kinetic behavior and I think one of the earliest recorded interpretations or results of the kinetic analysis of enzyme was by O ’ sullivian and Tompson as early as 1890 .	2.3758140363523954

He also studied the same enzyme and probably concluded in a very broad fashion that the enzyme reaction rates are influenced by acidity and enzyme concentration .	3.8399057789143383

These are the two parameters which today we understand as pH and the temperature .	4.284806563973104

He did not propose any basic hypothesis but suggested based on his experimental observations that with every ten degree centigrade rise in temperature the reaction rate doubles .	2.50096027013872

He also gave a good clue which became a landmark in the applications of enzymes that enzymes are more stable in the presence of a substrate .	3.1148145383151435

In fact many of the enzyme preparations then could be stored in the presence of substrate and that was another conclusion or observation he gave way back in 1890 .	3.2885176610107885

We store enzyme in the presence of substrate at low temperatures so that reaction rate is stopped during storage .	4.258336298132006

The low temperature was always understood phenomena that at low temperatures the enzymes will have a much better stability .	3.6237134626673115

They didn ’ t have any concept of enzyme substrate complex in those times and he only gave a hypothetical suggestion that one could store the enzyme at low temperature in the presence of substrate .	2.9079024980214014

His observations were all based on hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase .	3.2652142634283416

Then the second major kinetic observations came from Brown , also in the early 19th century and he proposed for the first time the concept of an enzyme substrate complex .	2.9633392997529473

He also proposed based on experimental observations that the reaction rate for an enzyme catalyzed reaction that is conversion of substrate into product follows saturation kinetics .	3.929350600951187

That means the rate increases initially and reaches to a saturation level .	3.460076407850848

He did not give any experimental or any hypothesis or any sequence of steps but he was able to understand that the basic reaction kinetics follows a saturation behavior .	2.4991003389788085

The rate increases to a maximum level and then stops at that and beyond that there will be no increase in the reaction rate .	3.4373626389577665

At low substrate concentrations the enzyme reaction rate is proportional to substrate concentration .	5.165874388824311

That is the phenomena we still understand , now with our detailed understanding of enzyme kinetics today .	2.9350715024235003

These are the broad observations by Brown .	4.2148970483738255

The major breakthrough in the enzyme kinetics was Michaelis and Menten as early as 1913 .	3.6740266063250044

At that time we had great limitation of analytical methods .	3.677755891211467

In most cases analytical procedures was not available to quantitatively measure the concentration of product .	3.6280996591145276

The concept of buffers was in a very primitive stage .	4.301227480003501

Buffers were not a very common tool to be used in the kinetic analysis .	5.615864627702741

Then they didn ’ t have much understanding of the stability of the enzyme as well .	5.126559948347441

Thirdly the enzymes they used were really not available in the highly purified state .	3.1532133334933383

What they were talking was with crude enzymes preparations and so the observations they could get were very limited .	2.6128344264304713

That is E + S E - S He also proposed that this interaction is reversible in nature and he was the first person to propose a mechanistic hypothesis which is followed by enzyme catalyzed reactions .	2.622731688556985

This enzyme substrate complex then breaks irreversibly to form the product and enzyme is released back .	3.689832364771397

That was the hypothesis he proposed and probably is one of the landmark contributions in the study of enzyme kinetics even today .	2.9976444847852055

Secondly he could also generate data using buffered substrate .	3.323733958821844

For the first time he carried out reactions under controlled pH .	3.5040270023370166

Then the third thing was that he introduced another concept .	3.5222635021162536

The first contribution was enzyme substrate complex , the second was buffered substrate .	3.918048350166504

The third and another important feature was that he said that when we talk of rate of reaction we must talk only of initial rate of reaction , vo .	3.4278851035779545

vo = ( dp / dt ) t = 0 He said that once a significant quantity of product is formed the kinetic behavior changes .	3.580941275251644

The enzyme follows a kinetic behavior which can only be understood at the initial reaction rate that means when you carry out the reaction the rate of product formation at time zero .	3.686284264573018

The fourth thing was he confirmed the concept of enzyme substrate complex .	3.6823321325268252

He also mentioned that the interaction between enzyme and substrate to form enzyme substrate complex is in perfect equilibrium .	3.9258732867861914

It reaches equilibrium at a very short time and then the reaction proceeds further to form the product .	4.634831250822161

Based on this hypothesis he developed his rate expression .	4.019065329568034

If you can write down the rate constant k1 , k2 and k - 1 for the three reaction steps that are involved in this case , one can write down the rate expression using equilibrium hypothesis .	4.157146880752965

That means at the equilibrium K1 [ E ] [ S ] = k - 1 [ ES ] and this by series of interpretations and using enzyme conservation equation , E0 = [ E ] + [ ES ] The total enzyme concentration then , at equilibrium is distributed between enzyme substrate complex and free enzyme .	2.579677623274613

So , you can write k2 [ E - S ] will be the initial rate of reaction .	5.74696656359788

Substituting the various parameters you get vo = k2 [ E - S ] = k2 [ E ] 0 [ S ] 0 / k - 1 / k1 + S So you get initial rate expression where the initial reaction rate in terms of initial enzyme concentration and substrate concentration are given .	3.9021291767652873

The rate constant here as you notice is k1 , k - 1 and k2 .	4.180452346324457

The term k2E0 was saturation reaction rate when all the enzymes were saturated with the substrate that is bound to substrate .	3.3694782158586034

This hypothetical situation will never emerge because there will always be equilibrium between enzyme , free enzyme , substrate and the enzyme substrate complex .	3.22609104037037

But hypothetical situation is that if all the enzyme is say saturated with the substrate then you have a maximum reaction rate which is called Vm .	5.186796651116007

Also k - 1 / k2 ratio of two rate constants k2 and k - 1that means the ratio of two rate constants which is involved in the break down of the ES complex , either ES complex can go to product formation or it can go back to substrate complex .	3.6010004329792733

The ratio of the two was considered as Kd , the dissociation constant of ES .	4.501417423058907

At the time of Michaelis and Menten , there was no proposal of Michaelis and Menten constant .	3.6611656665035697

He only proposed the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex .	4.377511514537512

The graphical representation of such reaction will be substrate concentration versus initial reaction rate .	3.7382050059346597

It will follow saturation behavior where the saturated reaction rate reaches to a value of Vm , which is nothing else but k2 [ E0 ] and the reaction rate at half the value of maximum reaction rate was defined as Kd , dissociation constant .	3.1385520355432397

He also proposed that this substrate concentration at which the reaction rate reaches half the Vm value which is the dissociation constant also has direct implication with the affinity of enzyme to substrate .	3.6461627519299955

It is substrate concentration at which the reaction reaches half of the saturation behavior and therefore it directly implies the affinity behavior and is being represented in the terms of dissociation constant .	3.0507728488150887

This was the major contribution which for a long time was valid until the time another major contribution which came in the enzyme kinetics was by Briggs and Haldane in 1925 .	2.7551799474320884

Mind it that J.B.S .	4.73200754167296

Haldane was one of the scientist who did all of his work in India .	3.9483324066443988

They proposed a hypothesis that Michaelis - Menten hypothesis is very correct in most of the respect except that they did not agree that the interaction between enzyme and substrate is that of equilibrium behavior .	2.9878924645790033

Instead of equilibrium behavior they mentioned in the case of rate terms a steady state behavior .	4.4749836683309

That means again they assumed the same thing E + S X E + P They also expanded the whole hypothesis .	2.7124799420373984

Instead of the enzyme substrate breaking down to irreversible step in many reactions which are known to be reversible in behavior , like the isomerization of glucose to fructose the true reversible enzyme reaction and there are many such examples where the reaction can be catalyzed in either direction .	3.1887284929132425

Therefore he also considered that the second step in the sequence is also reversible .	3.9579445439788326

We need not limit it to an irreversible behavior and he also mentioned that instead of having an equilibrium behavior here we have a steady state behavior which means the rate of change of x is zero with time .	3.0433905603133624

After a very short interval of time when the reaction starts , concentration of enzyme and the enzyme substrate complex reaches a constant value and if you look at the time scale for the enzyme catalyzed reaction , this is concentration axis .	4.358294012232339

Then enzyme concentration goes down , the enzyme substrate concentration builds up and this is the enzyme concentration and this is ES concentration .	6.201943511554222

This is short time .	8.376505201519562

When I show it in expanded view , this time scale is probably only for few seconds .	2.7141173642048755

This time scale up to here is only a few seconds which he named as induction period .	3.0839252392470566

You can call it transient state or free steady state period also but as soon as this transient period , which is very short time , passes both the enzyme substrate complex and rate of formation of enzyme substrate complex becomes a steady state and this will become zero .	3.093572579345862

Based on that he wrote his rate expression and they are almost identical rate expression as Michaelis and Menten with slight difference which we will notice .	3.583802201737287

You can write then with the assumption of ( dx / dt ) = 0 ( E0 ) = ( E ) + ( X ) X is enzyme substrate complex .	3.0105994251272445

You can also take the conservation equation of substrate which will be equal to the substrate concentration plus product concentration .	4.440717558980809

S0 = ( S ) + ( P ) + ( X ) If you write all the expressions in a rate term you will find the concentration of X will be [ X ] = k1E0 [ S ] + k - 2 [ E ] 0 { P ] / k - 1 + k2 + k1 [ S ] + k - 2 [ P ] But as a matter of fact one can always neglect X because it ’ s too small a concentration compared to S .	3.0954195457829465

We assume in most of the analysis that S0 is much , much greater than enzyme concentration .	4.1764801882186555

The concentration of substrate , being a small molecule usually is much , much larger compared to the enzyme concentration which is used as catalyst in very small concentration .	4.734871242391452

Usually in any enzyme catalyzed reaction , the concentration of enzyme will be of the order of few milli molar or even lesser than that .	4.234485135707655

So you get the concentration of enzyme substrate complex and based on this hypothesis you get the initial reaction rate .	4.720208913485666

He also followed initial reaction rate concept as V0 = k2 [ E0 ] [ S ] / ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) + [ S ] If you take a general reversible equation and put p equal to zero because at p equal to zero you are considering the forward reaction only where you start with the substrate .	3.3418059611623585

At the initial rate the product concentration is zero and in general expression if we write p equal to zero you will arrive at initial reaction rate .	3.383517015511263

The difference between Michaelis and Menten kinetics and that proposed by Briggs and Haldane lies in the fact that in the case of Michaelis kinetics they proposed the dissociation constant k - 1 / k1 ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) They named as this parameter ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) as Michaelis Menten constant in honour of Michaelis and Menten to recognize their contribution because bulk of the ideas they got in the whole analysis from the Michaelis and Menten assumptions .	2.9132904141102736

In fact Michaelis Menten himself never proposed or gave the name as Michaelis Menten constant .	2.6559566035737987

He always talked of dissociation constant which is a very fundamental parameter in the physical chemistry .	4.6711552412713

The constant which Briggs and Haldane proposed was not developed by Michaelis and Menten .	3.4287487588879926

Briggs and Haldane ’ s parameter of rate constant ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) was named as Michaelis and Menten constant which is analogous to dissociation constant .	3.210040986329299

In most cases it is true and that is why even the dissociation constant concept is feasible .	4.125960890764164

In most cases the rate of break down of enzyme substrate complex is the reason why many of the enzyme reaction are noted to be very slow in terms of the rate processes .	4.721108215316503

The term k2 , the rate constant k2 is usually in many cases it is fast also like for example in the case of invertase itself k2 has significant magnitude .	3.5411128312940097

But in many enzyme catalyzed reactions the k2 is very , very small compared to k - 1 .	4.340076616303944

Therefore the two hypotheses provide you a very similar inference as far as the kinetic function of enzymes are concerned .	3.6811370879417877

The concept of Vm the maximum reaction velocity , the concept of Michaelis Menten constant , the physical significance of these two parameters which are the critical parameters also remain the same even with Briggs and Haldane .	3.310686221329431

To summarize the results of the Michaelis Menten kinetics and Briggs and Haldane kinetics , we have two kinetic parameters which can characterize any enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.529364257839153

One is the maximum reaction velocity which is V0 = k2 ( E0 ) km = k - 1 + k2 / k1 Another point I like to make it clear here is Vm is not a kinetic constant .	3.1892455233966284

Vm is a parameter and is not a kinetic constant .	5.671448522008943

It is a function of enzyme concentration .	6.36737684319535

If you increase enzyme concentration , the value of Vm increases .	5.150486583956599

The kinetic parameter here is k2 , the rate constant which is responsible for break down of enzyme substrate complex into the product .	3.9001975712095236

Very often the k2 is also called as turn over number which is the rate limiting step in the enzyme catalyzed reaction .	4.478440880587604

The composite term the k2 ( E0 ) characterizes an enzyme in terms of saturation .	4.291427980192527

But that Vm value is at a particular enzyme concentration .	5.34154125719825

When you mention Vm as characteristic it refers to a particular enzyme concentration .	3.3465382796757024

Km is a true kinetic parameter which is a …. .. parameter of the three rate constants and is typically characteristic of any enzyme function and very often Km is used as a characterizing parameter for most of the enzymes that are available .	3.947351264632511

This kind of kinetics if you look at V0 = k2 [ E ] 0 [ S ] / Km + [ S ] You will also notice a very significant trend if you look at a graphical representation , saturation kinetics , represented by a rectangular hyperbola this is Km , and this is Vm / 2 .	3.2785155880850465

Unlike most of the chemical reactions you will notice that this represents a case where the order of reaction changes the substrate concentration .	5.12157838491331

In this case you will notice that at low substrate concentration , when substrate concentration is much , much smaller compared to Km you can keep km as the sort of a …. .. If it is very , very small compare to Km , you can arrive at v0 = k2 [ E0 ] [ S ] A simple first order kinetics and because k2 [ E0 ] is a constant at a given enzyme concentration and substrate concentration is a variable , it becomes a first order kinetics and the portion represented by this area is first order kinetics .	3.049755837330552

On the other extreme if you go to the concentration beyond this point when substrate concentration is much , much greater than Km v0 = k2 [ E0 ] ~ vm which means a zero order kinetics .	3.1951086337331973

In between the two the enzymes follow some kind of a mixed kinetics and that is one very characteristic feature of enzyme catalyzed reactions that instead of following a fixed kinetic order it follows a changing order of reaction kinetics at the two extremes .	3.23608238483713

This has very important feature .	8.80806969167776

In most of the subsequent analysis of the kinetic parameters or the reaction rate or the reactor design to simplify the situation we often either go to the zero order design or go to the first order design very often because this expression is comparably much more complex to analyze rather than a zero order or first order design .	3.5515201715094156

For most of the analysis , to understand the system either we simplify it to a zero order design and experimental data can be collected either at a very low substrate concentration range or at very high substrate concentration .	3.2457911513009323

When we see the reaction rate these understanding can be used even for use of enzyme as analytical tool or the action of the enzyme itself .	4.300968779645093

All these information can be used very significantly for those purposes .	4.459555817237867

To expand further on the Briggs - Haldane ’ s kinetics based on the reversible enzyme catalyzed reaction if you recall what we got v = { k1k2 [ S ] – k - 1 k - 2 [ P ] } E0 / k1 [ S ] + k - 2 [ P ] + k - 1 + k2 The original reaction rate expression was developed by Briggs and Haldane for reversible reaction that means you carry out the reaction either from the reverse direction or in the forward direction starting from s or starting from p and you can arrive at rate expression in terms of substrate and product concentration .	3.060258429125925

From this expression you can determine the equilibrium constant for the reaction .	6.245471389581967

The equilibrium constant can be monitored experimentally and that can also give you an idea of measuring or determining the individual kinetic parameters experimentally .	3.234136038570165

This you can arrive at if you put v = 0 and solve it and determine the value of Peq .	4.0994625504402356

At equilibrium , reaction rate will be zero .	6.7202180995554865

I will leave it to you to develop this .	4.2100714366696215

I don ’ t think it will be very difficult task to do that .	4.9360264804138305

That means if you carry out the reaction with substrate the maximum reaction rate velocity it reaches is Vs .	3.414426552665828

These data vs , ks , kp and vp will be determined experimentally on the basis of initial reaction rates and not as a general reaction .	2.9164261290934275

These parameters will be determined on the basis of initial reaction rate corresponding to either s or either p .	3.437308629968804

You can write as Keq = [ P ] eq / [ S ] eq = k1 k2 / k - 1 k - 2 = vms.kp / ks.vmp One would like to understand the enzyme kinetics on the basis of the experimental data .	3.1048068084651406

Today Briggs and Haldane ’ s kinetics has become a universally accepted reaction kinetics which is followed all over the world to understand the enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.052571096472639

The major issue is how to use those data primarily for determining the km value or the vm value corresponding to the particular enzyme concentration .	2.744390956123532

So an attempt was made for the treatment of experimental data so as to test or verify the hypothesis that has been proposed by Michaelis Menten initially and verified and approved or wetted by Briggs and Haldane .	2.474997979329457

The simplest way to do that was that these non linear equations if they could be converted by some means , by some modification , into a straight line relationship life will be much easier to analyze experimental data and the first attempt for that was given by Lineweaver and Burk .	2.604143899794241

Lineweaver and Burk made a very simple approach .	5.281965233446051

v0 = k2 [ E0 ] [ S ] / km + [ S ] Both these sides you take reciprocal and you can just write 1 / v0 = km / [ S ] .	4.305190985832788

1 / k2 [ E0 ] + 1 / km [ E0 ] Therefore this represents a straight line relationship between 1 / v0 and 1 / [ S ] .	4.355189369996507

That means when you plot 1 / v0 and 1 / [ S ] you get a straight line relationship with a slope equal to km / k2 [ E0 ] with intercept 1 / vm .	3.9160235787954125

On the x axis also this will intersect which will be - 1 / km .	4.853854963886859

So in a very simplistic way if you can take a double reciprocal plot one can analyze the experimental data that are obtained on the rate of reaction as a function of substrate concentration and verify the hypothesis .	4.243543486550067

For most of the cases such a hypothesis has been verified and found to be proven under certain limited conditions which have to be in line with the assumptions made by the scientists .	2.8914638008448503

While Michaelis - Menten kinetics is the most accepted kinetic pattern of the enzyme catalyzed reaction , most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions in practice deviate from the basic assumptions and only under certain set of conditions they obey the enzyme kinetics proposed by Michaelis - Menten or Briggs and Haldane .	3.277370092689587

I think with that we will stop at this point .	4.497720958309107

Welcome back to this course on Polymer Chemistry , and this will be the last lecture for this course .	3.726411282832337

What we will do in this lecture , we will cover , basically complete our discussion , which we are having on chemistry on polymer additives and we will talk about fire retardants , surface - active additives and reinforcing fillers today .	3.314073622053691

And then briefly talk about polymer blends and then go to the concluding remarks about this course .	3.5153924296424663

Let us talk about fire retardant and we had earlier about 2 , 3 lectures , earlier we discussed the fire retardant and the evaluation techniques , and how do we measure the fire retardant properties of a polymer samples .	3.0731265595132364

For example , that limited oxygen index , we talked about one of the ways to measure the fire retardants properties .	4.020137289532666

The other or a method , we talked about that method , where we burn the sample from a particular distance , under particular condition and in presences of some ignitable materials like cotton .	2.586311078523634

One of the also important thing that about fire retardants is that , whether the polymer during the burning , whether they are generating smoke and toxic gases .	2.693096571156052

So basically , a good fire retardant polymer should not generate lots of smoke and obiviously they should not produce toxic gases .	2.7024626210929514

So , fire retardants have chemicals , which are used to retard the ignition and burning of plastics , by interfering with the chemistry and or the physics of the combustion process .	2.362085008110424

Fire retardants additives enable plastics to meet various fire safety and performance standards imposed upon them , you know the application of plastics in various common public purpose like say in Aeroplane or in building materials .	2.198942274052378

Now , in those applications this fire retardants is a is a very important important criteria for regularity criteria for the polymers , to be used in those applications .	3.6805931453651572

Because for example , if you talk about a building construction material , where the polymer used must be a fire retardants should not catch or ignite fire easily or if in case unfortunately , it is giving ignitable , it should not produced toxic gas or a smoke .	2.5282711356772603

So , basically this properties required for the applications , where it is essential for the polymer to be fire retardant .	4.5651113986068035

Now , to design a fire retardant additives , we need to consider the polymer ignitability rate of flame spreading , rate of heat release and formation of smoke and toxic gases , as we mention before .	2.4530394374499997

One thing one must note that , there is no uniform FR additives , it is not that , one FR additive is best for all the polymers .	3.5493680923389146

So , is basically the choice of fire additives will depend upon the prior of the polymer and the additives , basically one additive may be very good for one polymer , but the same additive may not be as good as for the other polymers .	3.3964850418492527

So , it is it is essential that , the combination is chosen rightly so , no universal FR additives , performance varies with the final form of product .	2.5442445866771783

And generally , highly aromatic polymers and halogen containing polymers are inherently better fire retardant .	2.6483444979268462

Out of fire retardants work and they basically , prevent this ignition or combustion process , by whatever means or some means .	2.609155994089192

For example , they can reduce the or they can absorb the heat release during the combustion process , by releasing water from them .	2.99990238991756

They can form a insulating char on the combustion substrate and thus , by stopping or preventing supply of further fuel to the fire .	2.2924170927513825

So , it basically stops the fire and the fire comes down , it can also interfere , it can design additives , which interfere with the chemical reactions that maintain the fire .	2.6012601756697364

To maintain the fire , they are they resume that some chemical reaction happening , which are basically radical processes , which maintain the phase fire .	2.824303194650958

Now , if we can stop those chemicals reaction then basically , we can stop the spreading of the flame .	3.164998619872335

Example , this was the basis of choosing or designing fire retardants now , we talk about few additives , which work by one of these mechanisms .	3.6921922636705076

For example , titania alumina trihydrate , they when in a in a fire situation , it releases water around 200 degree centigrade , which basically inhibits the combustion process .	2.4438407513518943

So , that is one example of FR additive , which basically act as a fire retardant additives by absorbing heat , by releasing water .	2.7606818161395026

Second mechanism by which , some of the additives may function is by forming insulating char on the substrate , as we just discuss in a minute .	3.7909328820713513

And some examples are phosphorous flame retardant , phosphate ester , PVC and these are used mainly for PVC polyurethane polypropylene oxide type polymer .	2.62662706091222

Look at these are mainly inorganic material because inorganic material , they do not basically burn in those temperature .	2.8622153431627106

Typically , organic you cannot use organic material for char form , for making a cement char because organic material themselves burn off .	2.365209551308335

Similarly , phosphorous containing flame retardant act as a flame retardant by forming insulating char , the other flame mechanism by which , fire retardants works is by interfering with the chemical reactions , that maintain the fire and promotes the state of the fire .	2.4502777204131383

And for example , this halogenated or brominated aromatics , they emits hydrogen bromide during decomposition .	2.757204526798515

And the other halogenated compounds work that way , they basically a trap the radicals , which it is basically assumed or resumed that the radicals , which basically spread the fire .	2.820211580524781

So , this HBR or HX halogenated hydrogen halides basically , trap those radicals and prevent those chemical reactions , which spread fire and they are mainly used for polymers like nylon , polyesters , styrenics and polyolefins .	2.2227467925043087

A combination of halogenated FR and antimony trioxides also used some cases and it is a the way , it is worked that on combustion with the temperature at 600 degree Fahrenheit .	2.9531373627742177

This halogens form hydrochloride or hydrobromic acids , that reacts with the antimony oxides to form antimony halides or antimony oxyhalides , which basically traps those free radicals .	2.0250635024721473

And prevent that chemicals reaction , which basically produces , basically it stops or prevents this thermo oxidation process is , which we generates this volatile or flammable , volatile flammable volatile organic compounds .	2.0050740177341786

And it prevents formation of those flammable organic compounds volatile flammable organic compounds , they basically prevent the burning process .	2.6266549564656003

For example , polymer air interface or polymer mold interface or interface between two polymeric phases in a blend , for example .	2.433792500253948

Now , there are plenty of example of such surface active additives , what I am going to do in this next few minutes is , give examples of or give generic examples of this additives , how they work and give few examples of such additives .	2.6628850426989126

Now , let us first talk about polymer additives , which work in polymer air interface , first let us talk about additives , anti - fog or anti - fogging agents .	2.8452788419730792

Now , if you think about the polymer wrap , a transparent polymer wrap which are used in a grocery stores , which we use for wrapping this fruits or food materials , and they are kept in a refrigerator and a freezer .	2.6711060188154847

Now , if in a normal situation what will happen , the water droplet with condense in that flame and it will hinder your visibility , somebody is visibility through that flame .	2.7043254144101434

Because of , fog formation and customer will not be able to look at the food material , which is inside the wrapper .	3.586221023315334

So , he or she may not buy that material so , anti - fogging agents basically , a surface - active agent with migrate to this polymer surface .	2.5602156612818674

And being hydrophilic , it measure it makes the polymer surface white hydrophilic and in a hydrophilic surface , the water droplets cannot condense into beads .	2.655942312207688

When the come in the water vapour come in contact with this surface , they actual form a thin flame of water , which does not interfere with the light , such a way , that it basically gives any reduction in the visibility through this plastic material or it does not decrease the transparency of this plastic material .	2.8083506399576135

Similar types of additives is anti - stat additive or anti - static additive where , additives , which migrate to the surface and being water absorbing .	2.5044829612042694

It can absorb water from the atmosphere and form a layer of water molecules , which form path ways for dissipating the static charges .	2.8212052055271535

So , if there are anti - stat additives were not used during the normal usage of the plastic material , the static can static charge can generate on the surface , which might give lot of hazard to the user .	2.4798178976951206

But if anti - static additives surface - active anti - static additives are used then what happened the agent surface - active agent migrate to the surface .	2.8358653624364916

And they absorb water , which form channels through which , the static charge can dissipated so , there is no formation of static charge .	2.9638808221381936

Easy clean or self - cleaning type additives , which are basically very hydrophobic additives , which on migrating to the surface make the polymer surface very hydrophobic , such a way such a extreme that , when the water droplet condense on it , it cannot hold on to the surface , it basically rolls off .	2.6726376817764432

Because , the contact angle between the water and the polymeric surface is very high so , it basically rolls off and giving the strolling of process , it can take away that , they are the impurities , which are present in the surface .	3.3146319832360156

So , basically this type of may this additives make the surface self - cleanic so or easy cleanic , the cleanic of the surface is done easily .	2.7407795033636

Next step of additives are basically use to make the polymer surface useful for biological applications , there are lots some applications , where polymers or parts of parts made of polymeric polymeric polymers are used in biological application .	2.7105321914659446

In those cases , the polymer surface comes in contact with biological fluid now , the surface of the polymer should be such that , it should not interfere the normal biological processes or it should not basically introduce , or start the coagulation process in the biological fluids .	3.0914790548843802

So , this oxygenator is mostly made up of polymeric materials and the membranes by which , this purification is done is also made up of polymeric material .	2.939503118474809

Now , there are so many other example I can give where , polymers are used for medical application where , they are in contact with the biological fluids , may be blood or serum or or tissues and so on .	2.823655529560295

Now , if you look at the steps or the process of what happened when a polymeric surface , or any for the matter fact , any other external surface come in come in contact with biological fluid , the first step what happen , proteins present in the bio fluid , they get absorbed on the external surface .	2.667626668032877

And subsequently , they have lots of others steps which happens following the absorption process .	2.8274147455426575

Now , if we can make the polymer surface such that , this absorption of protein can be prevented or minimized .	3.2659927294981057

Then we can make this polymer surface hemocompatible or anti - thrombogenity , whatever we called that of anti - fogging to protein , whatever name we can give .	2.598700601588891

And that is done typically , by using by making the polymer very hydrophilic or drafting or modifying the surface using surface - active additives , surface - active additives make the surface reach with the hydrophilic polymer .	2.3378941604981676

So , that the protein coming proteins is prevented from absorbing on the surface theoritically and one of the examples of the polymers used for surface polyurethanes , polyethylene glycol , very often .	3.2353074176699974

So , they are the some examples , where surface active additives are used for medical application , modifying polymer surface is , that are utilized for medical applications .	3.1369768647142604

One other example is anti microbial , where basically there is some devices , which are used by many people like a computer mouse of the using , may have been used by somebody else .	2.7651820949772024

So , if this is a this mouse is made up of anti , this surface is anti - microbial additives , made up by anti - microbial additives then it prevents formation of microbes on the surface of the polymers and that actually prevent spreading of microbes between among people .	2.6543895060442755

And typically , surface active agents are used for this purpose , surface active agents are used basically to improve the mechanical property of the polymer surfaces like scratch scratch resistances , improved wear performances and so on .	2.7880585548035683

And then some other specific examples like anti - glare , anti - piracy , these are the some examples , where surface - active agents are used .	2.6150863627514083

Now , to be successful as a surface - active additives , the additives must have some attributes for example , it must be partially comfortable .	2.9997712644872627

If it is completely comfortable with the polymer matrix then it will soluble in the polymer matrix so , it will not come out to the surface and if it is completely in comfortable then it will bloom out of the surface. .. So , the additives in this case , must be partially comfortable so , that it may get the surface but be in the polymer matrix .	4.120955787180011

Second , it should have low surface energy components so that , it migrates during processing technique during processing technique or molding processor , it migrates to the surface , to minimize the surface energy .	2.8184623155946698

At least part of the surface , part of the additives must have a low surface energy component , it must be thermally stable .	4.4923913550130425

So , that , it can survive the processing condition and it should be chemically unreactive to the base polymer , it is being used .	3.7777674187344874

In some other application , which work other type of surface like polymer mold surfaces , to improve the mold release property of the polymer polymer material polymer material mole release are added .	2.872235945644492

Mold release basically , the a polymeric surface - active agent , which have long hydrophobic tail and because of , presence of this high surface low surface energy long hydrophobic tail , they migrate to the surface .	2.6409969752360514

And as a result , they form a lubricating layer on the molds on the polymer surface .	4.120483729880789

So , they can be easily released from the polymer mold , the other examples of surface - active agents , which are used for this parsing a solid filler in polymer matrices .	3.418380048923487

So that , the if you use external fillers , particular fillers to disperse them well in a polymer matrices .	3.3222370542608193

Some surface - active agents are used , which are basically cover our seat in the interface between the filler and the polymer matrices and thus , help the depression of the particular fillers .	2.6729969237766364

Compatibilizers , they are like a lock copolymer type surface - active agents , which which go and occupy the interfaces between two polymer phases , to reduce the interfacial energy between that two polymer phases and act as a compatibilizer .	2.610456947008195

Some example or few example of surface - active additives now , like this this additives or the other additives we talked about , they could be a small organic molecules or inorganic molecules .	3.4797410448694253

So , they would be polymeric or polymeric additives as well for example , this PTFE polytetraflurideethylene are added to the polymer to improve the wear resistances or coefficient of friction .	3.0236703918069954

Because of , the low surface energy , it migrates to the surface during processing and the coefficient of the friction of polymers are very low .	3.177865743767612

So , they form a lubricating layer on the base polymer surface and improve the wear resistances , these are the examples of few mold release agent .	2.9609064831292193

As I said there have long tail , hydrophobic tail and because of this , they migrate to the surface and and form a lubricating layer .	3.131727407525078

And which is release of the article , polymer article form the mold , examples of improving hemocompatibility or biocompatibility of polymeric surface is a tegomer , which is and PDMS .	2.2283916218622686

Because of , presences of PDMS , it migrate to the surface and because of , hydrophilic nature of polycapton electron , it basically form a domains of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions .	2.5066760317013337

So , which actually have in , being the surface biocompatible or hemocompatible .	3.105225988090236

Let us move to the next set of additives , which are fillers , which are mainly use to reinforce the polymer performances mainly , benefitting the mechanical properties of the base polymers .	2.7062754019912454

And many types of fillers mainly inorganic or added to polymers for different purposes and some of them are listed here .	2.849286086493704

And inorganic fillers , they themselves has high modulus so , these by adding these inorganic fillers , at least increases the modulus of the base polymer .	2.572559982162953

And some of the mover fillers , which are now a days used in polymer matrices , polymer formulation are nano - fillers .	3.1891162461925178

Some nanomaterials , which are used as a filler or nanoparticles , they are the particles having diameters between 1 nanometer to 100 nanometer range .	3.222473859682617

It would be silica particle titaniumdioxide and conducting particles and so on , there are many examples of such nano particles .	3.116350347685268

Nanotrubes specially , carbon nanotubes because of , they are very highly potential , this single one carbon nanotube or multi one carbon nanotubes are now a days , used for different polymeric nanocomposites .	2.314505730897633

Nanoclays , they are layered two dimensional structure , having thickness in nano dimension , they also used for in nanocomposites .	2.5113378012338377

And other fuller in spherical fullerenes and others also used as a nano - fillers .	3.1162769718726953

Now , what it does to the base polymer , the nano - fillers actually improve the some of the properties of the base polymers like strength , modulus , toughness , heat distortion temperature , UV resistances , barrier properties , we get the example of nanoclay during the discussion of barrier properties .	2.7525319194391265

It basically increases the tortuosity or increase the path to be covered by a gas to to come out of the polymer thickness .	3.323157777277953

It also increases thermal and electrical conductivity , if they are used in proper amount and their dispersion is proper .	3.2160741684342704

Obviously , they also being some challenges for example , with this inorganic fillers the transparency of the base polymers is basically come down .	2.5569567934146398

And that is because as we discussed earlier , differences in the refractive index between this fillers and the polymer matrix , and if the size is large then it can cause lot of scattering .	3.979599532379748

The ductility also come down along with increasing in the modulus , by this nano - fillers and thermal stability may be sometime also questionable because this might being some impurities along with this fillers .	2.3107995277956186

So , that might cause some questions about the thermal stability of this polymers specially , at the high temperature or during the processing condition , one example is shown here .	3.0263381377595624

This is a montmorillonite clays , which is very commonly used nanoclay and they have enlayered two dimensional structure and so , ideally to get the best property from the clay as a filler , they has to be dispersed quit well .	2.7702295209650023

So , their as the layer has to be dismandled and dispersed like , what is shown here and we call this as exfoliated nanocomposite .	3.417335960157006

And that happens there , is if there is the very good interruption between the polymer matrices and the surface of these clay .	4.2080755072820395

There could be intermediate scenario between these two , where the layers are separated to some extent with polymer chains in between and we call this as a intercalated nanocomposite .	2.9853580020214117

Obviously , to improve property one , this type of exfoliated nanocomposite with nanoclays always preferred .	3.284079698806916

But , obviously , with this the transparency come down and ductility of the matrices is comes down , with this let us basically come to our discussion on polymer additives .	2.845071083748009

And there are other additives can be discussed but due to lake of time , we cannot discuss the entire list of additives used for polymeric material , what I did I did discussed the important additives , which are very commonly used in polymer industries .	2.5843609041232876

Now , briefly talk about polymer blends , polymer blends is basically mixture of more than one homo polymers or copolymers .	3.3546268475125043

Now , to be why there why do we require to bring or mix to polymers , sometimes what happen one polymer is not sufficient enough to meet all the strange and requirement of properties for a product .	2.3584706890155833

So , sometimes by using another polymer mixed with other polymer , the properties is met so , we discuss , let us define few terms related to polymer blends , polymer blends as we know , it is a mixture of at least 2 polymers or copolymers .	2.6459410777849137

And miscible polymer blend is a mixture of polymers , which are homogeneous at molecular level .	4.095131543174115

Remember , we talked about while discussing with Tg , glass condition temperature , we discussed that this miscible polymer blend has single Tg .	2.9296323092714203

Basically , they are molecularly soluble with each other so , they are homogeneous at molecular level and of mixing for this type of blends is negative .	3.465812778222396

So , they are thermodynamically immiscible the mixing is positive .	4.117157075303371

Now , for application point of view , immiscible polymer blends is is not useful because then what happen during processing , they delaminate from each other .	2.9304434755053403

Because they are not miscible at all , they come out and you have the delamination problem , one layer comes out .	3.996591666307586

Whereas , miscible polymers blend is also not desirable from , in practical point of view because if it is miscible then you get the property , which is average of those 2 homopolymers .	3.593407237816748

So , you do not get best of the two polymers , which are mixed for making the blends so , it is always preferred to make blends , which are partially miscible or comfortable we say , we use the term comfortable , where the individual phases of those polymers are maintain .	2.833941113549716

But the interfaces are somehow , compatibilized using compatibiliser like block copolymers made up of two different homopolymers .	3.1594403050707323

So , basically interface between those two phases are stitched so that , they are not immiscible to that extent , that they delaminate , but they are not also miscible so , you can get the base properties of those two polymers as well .	3.0149600564219794

So , we talked about compatible polymer blend and polymer alloy are basically immiscible polymer blends with modified interface .	2.6787254389743276

Now , if you look at the thermodynamics of mixing , we discuss that Flory - Huggins Flory - Huggins theory of polymer solubility .	3.114860930093097

Where we have seen that , entropy of mixing is given by k t N one l N 5 1 N 2 l N 5 2 remember , we did this expression and of polymer solution where , N 1 is the number of molecules of component 1 , N 2 his for component 2 and 5 1 and 5 2 are the volume fraction of first component and second component .	2.8899685055683983

Now , if we increase the molecular weight if we increase the molecular weight of the polymer what happen , this number of molecules comes down .	5.054535327200168

So , the entropy of mixing contributes less and less to the mixing energy so , if you have very high molecular weight then the entropy of mixing is basically negligible .	3.7698267894781887

So , the high molecular weights blends or the polymer mixing is not entropy is given so , it is basically the entropy of mixing what determines , either two polymer will be misicible or not .	3.2824788135627645

So , if entropy of mixing entropy of mixing is negative enough then the polymers will make miscible blend and if there even 0 then aslo because of , slight entropy contribution , they may form misicible polymer blend .	2.64166777420515

What if this is positive then obviously this will form immiscible polymer blend now , to have a negative value of entropy of mixing , there should be some specific interaction between the polymers .	3.9006126687748086

And those specific interaction are shown here , some of them are this hydrogen bonding , ionic interactions or electron donor acceptor complex types .	2.75983836419513

So , basically , what am what we need to know that because of , the high molecular weight of the polymers , the entropy of mixing is not contributing significantly to the energy of mixing .	4.466243513608392

So , it is basically the entropy of mixing , which entropy of mixing which determines whether a polymer will blend , will form miscible blend or not .	3.1015391987245877

We shall be clear with few example , let us talk about two molecules decane and substitute methyl substitute decane like 2 4 6 8 10 pentamethyldodecane .	2.6413988998511853

Now , if you mix this two molecules , they will mix it easily no problem but similar polymers like polyethylene , if we increase this chain long enough , it will make polyethyl .	2.6341032051077904

And if we increase the chain both sides long enough , it will make polypropylene but they do not mix mix , they do not make miscible blend .	3.031782965049225

Because , this this no specific interaction between this two polymer , their entropy of mixing is not negative and because of their high polymer their high molecular weight then tropy of mixing is not contributing enough to the energy of mixing so , they form immiscible blends .	3.384524970537699

Another example we can talk about say , Bisphenol A polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate , if the length or the molecular weight of the polymethylmethacrylate is high then they do not form miscible blend whereas , this two form miscible blend as long as the molecular weight of PMA is small like polymer .	3.0016703524775488

So , as we increase the molecular weight , the solubility are miscibility between two polymers come down unless , there is a specific interaction , which makes the entropy of mixing negative , which happens here like polyphenyleneoxide and polystyrene .	3.019379606295311

Because of , rings of aromatic rings they can do interaction between them and because of this specific interaction , they form their entropy of mixing is negative and as a result , they form as result they form miscible blend .	2.950451019931139

So , basically to form miscible blend , the molecular weight has to be low , which is not a practical so , polymers which having high molecular weight , mixing is always governed by entropy of mixing .	3.8653982080508213

And that has to become that negative , there must be a specific interaction like hydrogen bonding are pi pi or ionic interaction between the two polymer molecules .	3.147058518904426

Now , reasons for blending , as we quickly , as we have just mention this improvement with , for the base polymer develop in broad property range of material , dilute or high cost engineering resins and so on .	2.245263599510373

So , let us , we have discussed enough earlier , we can blend by just mechanical mixing , we can do solution mixing as well we can dissolve those two polymers in a cosolvent and then form a film .	2.566413956383051

After that , we can make a interpenetrating network by dissolving one polymer in another monomer and then polymerizing the monomer to make a polymer , which will make this as a interpenetrating network .	4.2394121653160965

Let us come to the last very end of this course , I just want to make few concluding remark .	4.512203882415214

But this is the polymer tree where , basically we make polymers from monomers and monomers has to be characterized very well by all other techniques , to make sure that they are free of impurities .	3.488882006148607

Because , if there are impurities in the monomer , they will be carried over to the polymers and they are very detrimental for the use of the polymers .	5.420964911597209

Once you make the polymer , we have we basically understood what the different polymerization mechanism like step growth mechanism , chain growth mechanism and define specific technique polymerization technique .	2.6059416144762357

We started them in detail and once a polymerization is formed , we have learned how to characterise those polymer , both from a chemical point of view , chemical characterization .	2.7266886138210276

And determines their molecular weight , their solution behavior , their morphology , their thermal behavior , whether they are crystalline or amorphous so that , all we we discused how to characterise polymer completely .	2.369516096833354

Once the polymer characterize is over , we go to the processing step and finally , make the product , for the processing step we need to know few information about the polymers .	3.51361488051974

And we have not studied the processing part in detail but what I have done , I gave you the basic processing technique , which you must know to be understand the polymer completely .	2.6872808312529264

And then we last few lectures we discussed the applications of polymer , in the sense that , the different polymers properties and how they are evaluated like mechanical properties and so on .	3.4726214725909332

So , we discussed in so as a polymer chemist , you we very efficient in first two step monomer characterization , monomer synthesis and then polymerization process and characterisation of the polymers for synthesis .	3.103282984929332

Unless , you do not know the structure property relationship between the property , which enable the polymer to be at the final application , you cannot design the new polymers .	3.39838513634867

Last we just go back and look go back and look at the big picture a bird ’ s - eye view of the polymers , polymers applied when they met their are may be solution are in bulk They are synthesized in solution polymerization , they can be synthesized in bulk like a milk condensation polymerization .	2.6448591571097917

Polymers are also can be procute though , very very less quantity from natural resources .	3.1518471046535628

And these polymers are formed from monomers by polymerization different polymerization techniques .	4.198240662258568

What are the sources of this raw materials monomers , mainly they are from petroleum sources so , current end one of the important trend or requirement for polymer chemist at present is to find out natural sources .	2.4682848128852117

Because petroleum sources will be over soon or sooner or later , not only the petroleum sources , the polymers made up of petroleum sources actually causes lots of environmental problem like green house gas emission and .	2.1682502437255597

so on .	27.609861139293162

So , as a polymer chemist the challenge , the current challenge is to make polymers , the good which have good properties for application to be able to find application how they are how they can be made form monomers , which are sourced from natural sources .	2.8790846656583344

We talked about additives , which will be added during compounding or processing , and we get either the intermediate products , which are sold in market or we can get the simple shaped final product like sheets , film etc .	2.8610506932487207

And some of the and some will take these resins in plates or granular form and then make the other additives to make the final part .	3.1399052709724984

Now , after making the polymer product , what is the fate of the polymer , this is again another very contemporary topic of polymer waste .	4.421037563976427

In a lots of governments are banning plastics , plastic bags mainly because the waste it generates are not degradeable and so , basically , they creates lots of environmental hazards .	2.180603292290936

So , waste management of polymeric materials is a very important step and like the one , where polymers are need to be synthesized or produced from natural sources .	3.3658895593397373

Again this is another contemporary , very important topic for a polymer researcher that , what happened after .	3.414689948628467

So , new researcher a researcher should focus on to make efficient base management of the polymers , which are used for different application .	3.3253251539292537

If they can make biodegradable that is , fine .	4.32180625436139

If they are not able they are not biodegradable then if base whether they can be recycleable again to meaningful product or if they are not biodegradable or recyclable then how they the waste can be managed .	2.9926973578674576

So , that is one of the very important question for polymer chemist at this movement and obviously now a days , polymers are finding newer and newer applications , not polymers or not only applies for the commodity applications .	2.26791931052158

The polymers are now getting and finding applications is very , very high in products specially , also in health care related products .	2.673706727303418

So , with this , I come to the conclusion of this course and thank you , for being with me with this course and good luck to you .	2.6511532647774336

And I leave my email address , in case you need to contact , with a need for any reason .	3.1216062947289775

Thank you .	27.466586182296286

We had earlier discussed the reactor performance equations for three different types of reactors that I used for carrying out the enzyme catalyzed reactions ; that is batch , plug flow reactor and continuous stirred tank reactor .	3.311671498372017

While the choice of the batch reactor is primarily based on many factors other than the reactor performance mainly on the basis of the additional requirements of the reaction .	3.4486958354884547

For example if you require a very stringent pH control or a temperature control or addition of a secondary substrate at a different period other than the beginning of the reaction then batch reactor provides you operational convenience ; a better term would be the use of batch reactor is based on certain operational conveniences .	2.966255459588126

But based on the reactor performance the choice remains between use of a CSTR and a PFR and here I have given a summary of the reactor performance equations for CSTR and PFR and three different kinetic designs .	3.491258830261341

The first line indicates the reactor performance with respect to Michaelis Menten kinetics and the second line refers to when the reactor performance is in the zero order of the design that means when substrate concentration is much higher than the Km value and the third line is in the first order design when the substrate concentration is less than the Km value .	4.063176891904952

Similarly in the case of first order regime it is again the same thing that the K ' m is usually greater than 10S0 ten fold increase usually gives you a reasonable performance towards a first order regime As you have noticed that in the case of zero order regime the reactor performance is identical in both the cases in CSTR and plug flow reactor excepting that the magnitude of the tau is altered by epsilon that is voidage .	3.0578485670306965

Otherwise the reactor performance in the zero order regime is identical .	5.634551237390765

On the other hand in the case of a first order regime the performance of PFR , if you look from the point of view of fractional conversion the fact of fractional conversion on the quantity of enzyme required or the value of the space time , to be able to compare the reactor performance , what we need is to look at two different things : the fraction of conversion and the quantity of enzyme required .	3.5598681330887048

These two parameters can be looked at from these expressions .	4.498253257808523

We also looked at the relative quantity of enzyme required in CSTR to PFR which is given by this ratio and here you will notice that as we increase the fractional conversion the relative quantity of enzyme required for a first order regime significantly increases in the case of CSTR .	3.504486643974276

In the zero order regime there is no difference .	5.149247382277546

So therefore when we shift from zero order to first order regime the efficiency of plug flow reactor improves interms of its enzyme requirement or even in terms of space time .	2.9458787087922835

For example there are two parameters : either you can keep the space time constant and increase the enzyme loading ; or keep the enzyme loading constant and the space time can be varied .	3.929637647533268

In the case of PFR the space time required will be much less compared to CSTR in the first order regime .	3.8813089587860055

In the zero order regime the space time will be identical in the two cases .	4.5867974418368656

The intermediate regime is that where Km and S0 are of comparable value .	3.1919447016798044

That means let us say between one and ten .	5.08524333417633

That means S0 is something like about five Km values .	3.712339730884407

In that case the performance will be dependent not only on the magnitude of the fractional conversion but also on the magnitude of Km value and the relation between S0 and Km .	3.887219806518976

the performance will be dictated .	9.54057776525455

To give you a quantitative picture under three distinct conditions here I have taken three different fractional conversions 0.8 , 0.9 and 0.99 .	3.0021595156664937

I must also state here that ideally for most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions we will try to aim at the fractional conversion as high as possible .	3.3909391222874485

Hundred percent is perfect but very often you may not be able to test that and one will like to have fractional conversion anywhere between 0.9 and 0.99 .	3.0795221743040164

That is usually the pattern if the reaction is irreversible practically irreversible .	4.393114770063194

So under those conditions and assuming S0 equal to1M and epsilon of 0.5 , the Erel in the case of first order regime at 0.8 is 1.24 .	3.0527777501757494

They are any units ; don ' t bother about units .	3.4957271082989756

But these are relative ratio ; so the 1.24 .	4.938928457966718

As soon as you go to 0.9 conversion , the relative quantity of enzyme required is 1.95 ; almost about one and half times .	3.1548447432539777

But when you go from 0.9 to 0.99 , the relative quantity of enzyme becomes more than five times and it very significantly increases the relative quantity in the first order regime .	3.3756228971844204

If you consider from 0.8 to 0.99 , the ratio is still higher and the same relationship will also hold good for space time .	2.7738557675052156

equal to so and so .	7.950739573964562

In the case of zero order regime there is no complication whatever is the fractional conversion the relative quantity required are identical ; the same space time .	3.430349054118772

On the other hand in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics when the Emrel and S0 are comparable , it will vary and it will be a function of Km ; what the magnitude of Km is in comparison to substrate concentration .	3.05268191802531

We have chosen one molar here .	4.964125894086696

There is another point besides the fractional conversion ; the enzyme quantity required and the space time required .	3.6143938901560135

Another important parameter of the reactor design when we defined the parameters is reactor productivity that is Pr and is defined as XS0 / ?	3.4448864361253855

. You will notice that the reactor productivity also is linked with the fractional conversion .	3.959466722127567

In the case of the two types of reactor , the reactor productivity is directly linked with the fractional conversion and as it is also linked with the tau , inversely propositional to tau if the tau increases the productivity goes down .	3.348912026481459

Therefore the fractional conversion , whatever we have discussed about relative quantity of enzyme or the space time as a function of fractional conversion a reverse phenomena or the reverse behavior is true for productivity .	3.2662251169643373

When you increase fractional conversion the productivity will go down and for the first order regime the productivity of PFR will be much , much higher than the CSTR .	3.7973239328831316

I was trying to relate productivity and the quantity of enzyme or the space time .	3.5744364795380283

The quantity of enzyme required and the space time are almost analogous parameters .	3.8819896146318382

Their behavior on the basis of the fractional conversion is identical .	5.664706471422451

But the effect of the fractional conversion on reactor productivity is just reverse because tau appears on the denominator , XS0 / ?	3.4412409995511437

. So if the tau decreases more significantly with fractional conversion the productivity will increase more significantly and therefore in the case of first order regime , the productivity as a function of fractional conversion increases much faster in the case of PFR than CSTR .	2.816803481047813

The quantity of enzyme required or the value of tau increases more in the case of CSTR with increasing fractional conversion but the productivity increases more drastically in the case of PFR when fractional conversion is increased .	3.20565844998194

But in general with increase in fractional conversion the productivity will go down in both the cases because in the reactor performance equation the decrease in tau will be much faster compared to increase in fractional conversion .	3.613105884737032

In general there will be a decline in productivity as fractional conversion increases but the relative decrease will be more pronounced in the case of CSTR than in PFR .	3.2386549053532505

No tau .	27.088212920598018

Relative decrease of productivity , the tau and productivity are related inversely .	3.392585247499902

Therefore the tau increases with increase in fractional conversion more pronouncedly in the case of CSTR , the reverse may happen in the case of productivity .	3.647078570957065

Therefore I think one should very clearly understand the relationship between fractional conversion , enzyme quantity required or the space time and productivity .	3.234443654975351

Very often the choice of the right type of reactor whether to use a CSTR or a PFR is dependent upon the type of the reaction system we are looking at .	3.589554404326304

For example in case we are talking of a very high value product say for example .... transformations , a pharmaceutical product where the cost of product or the cost of substrate is very high .	3.860870083555801

You don ' t want to waste the substrate .	4.344926562956669

Then in such case we would like very high fractional conversion .	4.047801469379226

We will not like any substrate to remain unconverted because the cost of substrate is very high and even at the cost of productivity you go for higher fractional conversion .	3.217947005087163

The productivity will decrease ; but even that is desirable to have a higher fractional conversion and a lower productivity .	3.7682002611302794

On the other hand if you are talking of a lower or reasonable value product or in those cases where even the unconverted substrate can be used along with the product you don ' t have to separate the product for application as in the case of glucose fructose syrup when you isomerise glucose to fructose the final product is a mixture of glucose and fructose .	3.126171148652463

We never attempt to get the reaction converted to completion because then the residence time , space time required in the reactor will be very , very high because it ' s a reversible reaction .	3.9262927243477974

Therefore the final reaction product usually is an equilibrium mixture of glucose and fructose where the fractional conversion is only 0.4 or 0.45 not even 0.8 .	3.010294896889801

No separation is attempted .	8.29828609972405

So in those cases lower fractional conversion but we keep very high stake on productivity ; productivity is tried to be maximized .	2.448929468087997

The cost of the product is not very high so productivity becomes very important parameter .	4.920267794950683

But if the cost of the product is very high which also requires to be separated from unconverted substrate then it will be desirable to have a high fractional conversion even at the cost of productivity .	3.755354086544498

So we must clearly understand the inter relationship between the kinetic order regimes , the fractional conversion and the productivity and the parameter which is very important in the case of reactor performance is the effect of substrate and product inhibition .	3.842324068107181

Most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions will experience some kind of inhibition .	5.231061030367098

One inhibition as we talked that you can add a third component in addition to substrate and product and add another inhibitor either for any purpose of study or anything usually but that doesn ' t come into picture when we talk of industrial reactions using enzymes because we will not like to add inhibitor to the system for carrying out the enzyme catalyzed reaction for commercial purposes .	2.7485771987961356

But still most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions are inhibited naturally by either substrate or the product ; the product is a very common case .	4.592166472631971

For example in the case of CSTR the concentration of substrate in the reaction mixture is very , very low , same as in the outlet or in other way the concentration of product is very high in the reaction mixture .	4.782058163883795

So if a system experiences product inhibition and you use a CSTR you are making the reaction going at very high product concentration .	3.4210557467933675

That means in extremely inhibited conditions the reaction rate can be very , very slow .	4.132779835177729

On the other hand the reverse might be true in the case of plug flow reactor and so the incorporation of effect of substrate and product inhibition on the reactor performance equation becomes very important .	3.3601346755721377

While we are considering all other conditions of the isothermal operation or partitioning effect , diffusional limitations are still valid .	3.1790749271823873

We are still talking about idealized the vectors we are only changing the kinetic part .	2.8420241041204375

That means if we consider and if we let us take a general case of substrate inhibition where the reaction rate is given by v = k2E0 ( 1 + K ' m / S + S / Ks ) This is a general kind of expression .	4.17112745489831

Ks is the substrate inhibition constant , dissociation constant and Km is the natural Km value for the reaction .	3.612345178278807

If you recall we discussed substrate inhibition kinetics in which the excess of substrate causes binding of two substrate molecules to the enzyme molecule and which becomes a dead end complex .	3.1793500037317437

Under that condition at in the case of CSTR you can develop the reactor performance equation for such system also on the same lines as we did for Michaelis Menten kinetics .	3.45772435996278

That means you make a mass balance across the reactor , simplify it and the final reactor performance equation for this case for CSTR is XS0 + K ' m ( X / 1 - X ) + S20 / KS ( X - X2 ) = k2E0 ?	3.189440187475657

In the case of PFR the same reaction expression will result in XS0 - K ' m ln ( 1 - X ) + S20 / 2KS ( 2X - X2 ) = k2E0 e ?	2.8809926813986646

The reaction performance equation gets modified and as you will notice that in the case of substrate inhibition , the performance of CSTR will be far superior .	3.819728161949764

If you can use these two equations and substitute arbitrary values for fractional conversion at a given substrate concentration the performance of CSTR works out to be far superior compared to a plug flow reactor because the concentration of substrate at any given time physically is much lower than in the case of PFR which for bulk part , more than half of the part , substrate concentration is very high only in the upper half .	3.236190060665891

If you look at product inhibition , product inhibition also has influence in two modes .	2.7848677931913186

Either the product can inhibit competitively or non - competitively .	3.9596111598398127

Uncompetitive cases are rare and as I mentioned earlier also in most cases the inhibition patterns are usually either competitive or non competitive .	3.343002430101799

In the case of product inhibition the reaction rate is given by v = k2E0 1 + K ' m / S ( 1 + P / K ' p ) K ' p is the inhibition constant which is the competitive inhibitor of the reaction .	3.9881576897636752

In this case also one can write down the reactor performance equation for CSTR as S0X + K ' m ( X / 1 - X ) + K ' m / KP ( S0X2 / 1 - X ) = k2E0 ?	3.4669745005925425

In the case of plug flow reactor the reactor expression will be S0X ( 1 - K ' m / KP ) - K ' m ln ( 1 - X ) [ 1 + S0 / KP ] = k2E0 ?	3.166597855167437

e Even in the case of an uninhibited reaction the relative performance of PFR as the fractional conversion increases is superior .	3.766150912476639

Relative quantity of enzyme required or the relative value of the space time required in PFR for increased fractional conversion is much , much higher in the case of CSTR compared to PFR .	3.8347834813085124

On the other hand the analogous relations in the case of non - competitive product inhibition where the reaction rate can be given by v = k2E0 [ 1 + K ' m / S ] [ 1 + P / K ' p ] The CSTR reactor performance comes out at XS0 + K ' m ( X / 1 - X ) + K ' m / KP.1 - X / S0X2 + X2S20 / Kp = k2E0 ?	2.833384560542616

In the case of PFR the expression is arrived XS0 ( 1 - K ' m / K ' P ) - K ' m ln ( 1 - X ) [ 1 + S0 / K ' P ] + S20X2 / 2K ' P = k2E0 ?	3.4132216148980308

e When the enzyme is subjected to inhibition by excess substrate , it is more serious in the case of a plug flow reactor ; effect of inhibition on the reactor performance is more detrimental in the case of PFR .	3.51200065974661

The situation can be slightly improved if you make intermittent feeding of the line ; for example you use a plug flow reactor in which the feeding is done at more than one point .	3.475652670782357

That means you don ' t use a high substrate concentration right at the beginning .	3.8266423779982848

Such modifications can always be looked at .	4.795331622244472

On the other hand the effect of product inhibition is more serious particularly when high conversions are required .	3.318621622196384

So it is not only the effect of product inhibition which is more serious in the case of a CSTR compared to PFR but when high fractional conversions are required the product inhibition becomes even more serious .	3.1291127605831774

The product inhibition is more detrimental in CSTR compared to PFR because the concentration of product is much higher in the case of CSTR .	3.933382275336937

But when higher fractional conversions are required the problem becomes more and more serious because the product concentration is high when the fractional conversion required is high and therefore in those cases the plug flow reactor becomes almost a necessity .	3.361791075357673

That is one of the reasons that in the literature a large number of immobilized enzyme systems have been reported to be used in a plug flow reactor mode rather than a CSTR mode unless there is the requirement of pH control or in some cases when you want to add another constituent at a later stage .	3.632419316563939

I don ' t consider it necessary that a third inhibitor to be added it can be either substrate or product which can cause inhibition which has to be taken into account while making a reacted regime while analyzing the reactor performance .	2.952345933894685

These are theoretical situations which are comparatively simpler .	3.94266668821717

In many practical situations the inhibition patterns are usually complex .	3.582914379063158

They are not as simple .	8.06959472934931

For example I have illustrated here the analysis of penicillin to six APA and phenylacetic acid by penicillin acylase .	2.6683605881007866

This is an enzyme catalyzed reaction which is used commercially all over the world and particularly 6 - amino pencillanic acid is used as the intermediate for synthesis of ampicillin and today because the use of penicillin as an oral drug has reduced significantly excepting for application .... ointment .	2.612639264311675

But whenever it has to be administrated orally you always look for derivatised penicillin and ampicillin is a major product where six APA is .... here .	2.6943317133384226

In such a case you see the reaction is inhibited both by P as well as A .	4.841953566805079

Both the products inhibit the reaction .	5.315886757226606

For the sake of writing the rate expression I named as P and A and in the case of A it is inhibited competitively .	3.4656649270820132

A is a competitive inhibitor and P is a non - competitive inhibitor.You can also arrive at cases we there is substrate inhibition also and life can be very , very complex in such cases .	3.228683412737315

The case of penicillin acylase in detail manner has been analyzed and the reactor performance compared by Warburton and associates in Biotech .	2.763677377940533

Bioengineering volume fifteen , page thirteen , nineteen seventy three .	3.6003019561531464

That is one case which illustrates the use of reaction kinetics for the design of or for the analysis of the reactor performance for any given practical enzyme catalyzed reaction which is not a theoretical one but which has been used practically and the process of the system is commercially used all over the world .	3.5907325927436795

Besides the inhibition pattern the next step if you recall is the relative concentration of feed substrate and the magnitude of S0 / Km and the kinetic regime of the reaction .	3.8248152132041473

We have also seen the fractional conversion and productivity .	4.814201829672364

One of the most important motivating factors for looking at immobilized enzyme was the operational stability .	3.0562895885242316

That means you can use them continuously over a very long period of time and we must also look at how the reactor type influences the operational stability .	3.4601744296821684

The system which is more operationally stable has also some desirable features even at the cost of productivity or fractional conversion all those parameters taken separately .	2.8248188282909377

We can divide the operational stability in two major patterns .	4.414841527584894

One of the major patterns is where the thermal deactivation or the loss of enzyme activity during continuous use is independent of substrate concentration .	3.057585848761584

That means irrespective of substrate concentration in the reactor the inactivation rate is constant and which can be given by - dE / dt = kd.E A first order decay rate constant that is what we are familiar with .	4.2672067933037106

In such cases the life is simple because the substrate concentration is not involved .	4.351485165726085

The reactor performance can be simply considered on the basis of thermal deactivation and if you replace in your idealized reactor performance equation instead of E0 , if you just transfer it to E0.e - kdt where t is the operational time , you can get the modified reactor performance of the effect of operational stability on the reactor performance .	3.014099165257609

In such cases you see the performance for CSTR .	4.615887075070886

We are comparing the reactor performance at two different times say from zero time to time t how does the reactor performs .	3.1207073534959284

In the case of CSTR kd.t = ln S0X0 + K ' m ( X0 / 1 - X0 ) / S0Xt + K ' m ( Xt / 1 - Xt ) Here the X0 and Xt are the fractional conversion in the case of CSTR with a time zero and t .	2.713078184843735

We are considering all this reactor performance under steady state conditions .	4.062274687093016

Once the steady state has been achieved at time t equal to zero , the fractional conversion is X0 and after the elapse of time t fractional conversion declines as a result of enzyme deactivation and that is the fractional conversion Xt .	3.3266228921603163

Mind it ; this t should not be confused with the space time .	4.1288151565267555

Space time is kept constant over the reactor operation , over a period of time t and only the fractional conversion is declining from X0 to Xt and this gives you the reactor performance or the effect of operational stability on the reactor performance in CSTR .	3.169808230018758

On the other hand in the case of PFR the corresponding relationship is kd.t = ln S0X0 - K ' m ln ( 1 - X0 ) / S0X0 - K ' m ln ( 1 - Xt ) Here also you can consider the effect of the operational stability on the reactor performance .	3.0089913695980153

If the kinetic regime of the reaction is in the zero order that means the K ' m in both the expressions will be deleted .	4.3314351482702875

It will be only first term and the effect of operation stability is independent of the type of reactor .	4.704821285030031

The factor operational stability will be identical in the case of two types CSTR and PFR if we are operating on a system in the zero order regime whereas if you are operating in the case of first order regime , the first term will get out will be neglected and then the difference in conversion ..... ...... between PFR and CSTR will be magnified .	3.165558283862549

The Xt value in the two cases after the elapse of time t will be different in the two cases and the output of the PFR , plug flow reactor will decrease much faster with time than in the case of CSTR .	3.19264868908405

When you put some arbitrary values you can see that in the case of PFR or a substrate independent thermal deactivation the output that means the fractional conversion after time t will decrease much faster than CSTR .	3.4108516019835196

The deactivation is not linked to the substrate concentration and therefore in such cases the CSTR will be a desirable parameter .	5.190038559855075

On the other hand if you look at the kinetic pattern of thermal deactivation , the thermal deactivation is also very common situation , because in most cases it can be understood that the enzyme is more stable in the presence of a substrate .	3.760687369266566

So higher the substrate concentration the thermal stability is more ; its Kd value is much , much less in the presence of substrate and the deactivation expression can be written as - dE / dt = ( k ' d / s ) .E Here the deactivation rate is inversely propositional to substrate concentration .	3.283434889644476

Higher the substrate concentration the deactivation rate is slow .	6.948890122381013

In such a situation for a CSTR you can very easily write the reactor performance .	3.915489585870319

kd.t = S0 ( Xt - X0 ) + S0 ln ( X0 / Xt ) + K ' m ln K ' m + S0 ( 1 - X0 ) / K ' m + S0 ( 1 - Xt ) This is for CSTR .	3.7425866973118374

In the case of PFR the situation will be much more complex because the concentration of substrate across the reactor is not constant .	4.287915314533477

So the rate of deactivation also along the length of the reactor is different and therefore a simple analytical solution is difficult .	3.5406383148053218

One has to probably get the reactor performance based on operational stability by a numerical solution and an analytical solution will be difficult .	2.9797003643982163

But in general you will notice that in the case of substrate dependent thermal deactivation the performance of PFR will be superior compared to a CSTR .	3.896735599852954

The PFR is a desirable type of reactor where the effect of drop in the reactor performance as the result of enzyme deactivation will be much slower for substrate dependent thermal deactivation .	3.842806557786622

Or in other words in the case of substrate independent thermal deactivation the reverse is true .	3.6977332915251933

CSTR is much more desirable .	11.555091401028696

To summarize what we have done as far as the idealized reactor systems are concerned we have originally defined our idealized reactor systems which means that we are considering the extreme fluid dynamic regimes ; back mix and plug flow .	3.1043214266998986

We have not considered any of the mass transfer limitations or partitioning effect in the system and in the worst situation if you compare with the two major types of reactor systems , continuous flow reactor system , CSTR and PFR we can analyze the reactor performance for a given reaction on the basis of the relative concentration of substrate to the Km value of the reaction .	3.8905124112654375

Basically it amounts to looking at the reaction kinetics .	6.1984677719645145

Then we need to look at the effect of fractional conversion and productivity ; what is the desirable feature ?	6.105948188669886

Whether we are looking for high fractional conversion and that is the demand of the system or high productivity depending on the nature of the product stream .	4.488629313788123

Then we have to look also the inhibition pattern if any .	4.693620450771774

In some cases if the kinetics is much simpler one can very easily approximate it to first order or zero order or even Michaelis Menten ; the life if simpler .	2.817060200948106

But in case if there is inhibition pattern that must be taken into account for analyzing the reactor performance .	3.373754937616965

Finally the operational stability of the system as a result of or the effect of the enzyme deactivation during the continuous operation of the two different types of reactor will also be influenced by the deactivation pattern and one cannot decide absolutely whether a CSTR is desirable or PFR is desirable .	3.8070178608413427

Under different sets of conditions , under the requirement of the reaction systems , the process requirement one has to make a choice and compare interms of the overall productivity or the desired parameter .	3.053246560207901

That is the sort of system that we have to look for our ideal reactor performance .	4.178905876010055

Besides ideal reactor performance we have so far not considered anything about mass transfer , non - ideal flow .	3.202225029063673

This is the practical reactor which we are talking like we talked many of the configurations like which were a combination of CSTR and ultra filtration reactor or a hollow fiber module .	3.3379593994144527

They may not to be an ideal flow dynamics .	5.032933867505947

They may vary somewhere in between the two and that flow behaviour also might influence the reactor performance .	3.4406248481068293

We will take those cases individually in subsequent classes .	3.3874947217478364

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture , this is lecture 16 .	2.780526800048381

We will discuss lecture on living radical polymerization ; and we will talk about three different type of living radical polymerization , ATRP , SFRP and RAFT .	3.3706574620248575

We will talk about the full forms , time ; and I planned to just give you examples of commercial polymers , which are made use of this radical polymerization technique and then , we will conclude this module of radical chain polymerization at the end by giving you a brief summary of what we have learnt in radical chain polymerization .	3.2180818672758837

This recap in the last lecture , we discussed in detailed a different polymerization processes , and we spent lot of time on emulsion polymerization .	3.306387306556948

And we discussed , we just introduced the concept of living polymerization and let us begin from the same page , we left in the last lecture .	3.1437891619249823

Now , as we were discussing that in a normal chain polymerization process , as soon as the initiation reaction is slower , as we know initiation reaction is slower .	4.377627733587644

So , the chain initiation takes place leaving a time during almost during inter polymerization time and the propagations step is faster .	2.565605823568429

So , as an agent , a radical generates its undergo propagation reaction and at the end by molecular termination reaction have , and the polymers become dead with time you generate different molecular weight polymers and of course , these polymers are not live or dead .	2.869099630074723

Now , if we can by any means start almost all the chains at more or less same time ; that means , initiation must be faster and then , let the polymers , all these chains we just started let them under go polymerization reaction or propagation reaction for same deviation .	2.51101959980198

Then , what happen on that has to happen .	5.0626619623350795

This propagation has to be much lower compared to initiation first of all and if that happen or if that has to happen , then all these polymers should be live .	3.3281907485164357

That means they are reactive to the monomer .	4.682617595588943

So , they can undergo polymerization reaction , say the live you can add a second monomer and form block polymer at the end of the polymerization .	3.160383869235555

Now , how can we achieve this ?	5.015544201428363

All this point we just talked about in a normal radical reaction .	5.328770263318414

What happen is you get a radical which immediately reacts with a monomer to start the chain , and you have this , all this reaction forming RM n dot and propagation continued RM n plus 1 dot and so on and this initiation process is lower .	3.5122339073141244

So , as soon as this radical generates , they undergo polymerization reaction and these two reactions n M dot plus M n dot did undergo by molecular reaction forming either M n M plus n depending upon which type of termination reaction they are undergoing .	2.8947381453187804

So , at the end , you get a dead polymer .	6.983288251105294

Now , if by any means if you can know what is the rate of termination reaction ?	5.80661231187535

Rate of termination reaction we know k t M dot square , where M dot is the concentration of total radical , total propagating radical .	3.5430221810413753

So , this is summation of all the concentration , of all the propagating radical present .	5.977775604882469

Now , if you can reduce this M dot , then what happens is RT comes down much lower .	3.352839617206295

If you are by any means if you can reduce this M dot , then RT comes down .	3.5818558759693384

So , if you can bring down such a level that RT is insignificant , then there practically no termination reaction would happen .	2.599897917677381

In this case that will in suit that the polymers which are forming , they are not killed or the chains which has getting initiated , they are not killed .	3.652430391101224

That is one thing .	8.51618502317094

How do we achieve is M dot is very low , then what is R p ?	4.302004554548585

R P also you know this k P MM dot .	4.582759347613072

This is very slow .	10.210910832344734

Then , rate of polymerization also will be lower compared to a normal radical polymerization .	6.7653427667645705

So , that ensures if you can bring down the conception of this , that ensures that the termination reaction is much low or if is basically insignificant .	3.1085914262417744

Now , how do you achieve the condition where you let all the polymers , all the chains react for the same duration ?	3.5564329412921025

Typically , all time in normal reaction , we write a single arrow which means any reversible reaction .	2.8683960656335583

Now , in this case we are writing double arrow which means this reversible reaction .	3.9474023206028277

Now , if the structure of Z is such that its inactive radical , then this would not take part in propagating , radical propagating step .	2.9956577394937622

So , only this will take part in propagation step .	4.836681047617124

Now , this will again react with the monomers and form different chain length .	4.625383549723481

Now , because this is radical , it will be again part of the equilibrium process with Z .	5.620468730049281

So , this is a case we are talking about reversible termination .	5.868916441957377

So , if this happened in normal case , if this bimolecular reaction happen , you get a termination step dead polymer , but in this case because this is reversible , this can again come back and give you back this active radical and inactive radical .	3.0901102409539463

Now , if the structure of this is such that here if this equilibrium is shifted mostly towards right hand side , then what happened is this radical stays or spend most of its time in a dormant form .	2.7272016054579287

This is a dormant form .	5.749714698304278

This does not take part in the polymerization reaction , where for a small fraction of their lifetime , they are present in this active form .	3.7638636010378415

So , what happen in this way you are reducing the concentration of the radical active radical present and that will ensure that your termination reaction are negligible because this is a reversible termination reaction .	3.7393387156704594

This radical is not under if it do not undergo any termination reaction .	3.6072768095847123

It can react with a monomer and again go back to the domain form because is equilibration process or reversible process , so that all the radicals , all the propagating radicals we generate from the initial initiation reaction , they will spend more or less same amount of time in as active form and as a domain form which will ensure that all the polymer chains are progressing or reacting during or for a same number , same amount of time or same duration .	2.7769739598740664

So , one more time if you have a initiator which reversibly form this R dot and z dot , where R dot is an active radical and z is inactive radical because of its structure , then what happen is only these undergo polymerization of propagation reaction and at the very beginning , the concentration of R dot is quite highest .	2.9581026407940496

They will undergo some termination reaction till the concentration of z dot is much higher at very beginning and this forms , this might undergo bimolecular termination reaction .	3.083073946915419

So , you get drop in R dot concentration and you get more and more z dot at beginning once the concentration of z dot is sufficiently higher compared to R dot and also f chosen this equilibrium such a way that the equilibrium constant is towards this side .	2.9284762965293307

So , the average time radical , a propagating radical spend in this form which is active form which can react with the monomer and propagate much lower compared to the time , an average radical spend in dormant form or inactive form .	2.9363625542559384

By this way , you are ensuring this .	5.7921254873411

After the initial period of time , the concentration of radical are small which will ensure the termination reaction is negligible and also because these are equilibrium process , every radical is coming out and going in the dormant form .	2.9694948269187003

All this time , all this propagating radical is spending same amount of time in this form .	3.7471152555582763

So , they are undergoing the propagating radical for same duration which ensures that the chain length of the polymer produced is almost similar size .	3.672666383721903

So , p d I would be very narrow .	4.7682114663379185

So , 1.02 to 1.1 1.2 something like this .	6.275177545148532

So , they are very close and at that the end of the reaction , again they will remain in this form .	4.205787685378952

So , you can add a second monomer to form a block polymer .	4.442229683178845

The three types of living radical polymerization .	6.0959206604671285

First one is ATRP , atom transfer radical polymerization .	3.8114353308665843

In this case , your initiator is a halide and you have redox reaction , where you have a q plus halide .	3.8655923614986945

It can undergo reversible atom transfer reduction process , where you get R dot plus Cu Br 2 L .	2.744174357011091

L is an organic which basically complex with this copper salt , so that the copper salt remain insoluble , remain soluble in the organic solvent .	2.979500454979896

So , this now again can react with M from R M n dot , it can M 1 , M 2 and so on .	3.3918383209821257

So , it happens , this happens to all the radicals and this again goes to the same reaction form , R M n Br plus Cu at l .	2.994123894752813

So , at any moment of time , the concentration of this is very small which means the termination reaction is very less because this is a part of the equilibrium .	6.314472874026391

So , one more radical it is coming out capturing a monomer , increasing the chain length , going into the equilibrium .	3.091975151897192

Second monomer , second radical is coming out reacting with the monomer and going to reaction .	4.0438827278259755

So , average time this spends in terms of active form is same for all the propagating radicals .	4.09281172499596

So , chain length , all the propagating radicals are same .	4.564900522227945

Now , if I write equilibrium is constant for this reaction , this is M dot .	5.542561113811737

For this reaction , M n dot we are writing M dot and copper 2 plus .	4.103561270145979

I initiated this side is initiator which is this initiator is this and Cu plus which is this .	3.9427501584654494

I am writing if you confuse .	5.733216093750676

I am writing this equilibrium reaction for .	5.431419249946294

So , this reaction , this K K of this reaction would be given by this .	4.409018872903784

So , the concentration of this propagating radical is given by K I Cu 2 plus k I plus k I Cu plus by Cu 2 plus I is R Br .	3.3149005319214075

Concentration of I R is the concentration of R Br .	6.069946335662052

So , what is R p ?	6.697230334885462

Rate of polymerization will be given by k p M and concentration of the radical which is given by k p M k I Cu plus by Cu 2 plus .	4.165949704016217

So , that is the rate equation and the molecular weight would be given by the total number of monomers is reacted .	5.548802280868923

So , M 0 is the initial .	8.512969348531886

The concentration of your monomer by M t is a monomer present in time t divided by total initiator concentration which is given by the conversion M 0 by I 0 , each initiator by one radical and one radical produces one chain .	2.9037470777339687

So , if you have monomer polymerized with two chains , then total decrease of polymerization will be 100 by 2 is 50 .	3.1560168729933036

Now , if you plot with time , see this is experimental plot .	4.166071955532405

You get same for bulk and say if a solution you get a slower rate because this is straight line , which means that this is a first order reaction .	4.383905825130641

Example of R Br is 1 phenyl ethyl bromide and l is 4 , 4 di 5 nonyl 2 2 dash by pyridine .	2.565418292666421

So , if you have these , all the three plus styrene bulk solution , you get experimentally this .	3.4888171163636432

So , what happens to the molecular weight if you plot molecular weight versus time ?	4.904012954997211

What will you get ?	10.154834826492872

Again , it is a straight line .	11.823749674366681

As time goes , no reaction forward .	5.247755624000877

So , more propagation happen .	8.334066148559337

So , the reaction molecular rate increases linearly , where in case of normal chain polymerization , you can get very high molecular even at beginning of the polymerization and in such case , the molecular rate is small at the beginning and it increases slowly after .	4.039983011562383

As the time goes , you can take a monomer and do a reaction like this , R n X a polymer and then , you can add a second monomer .	4.542453031113623

You can form a block polymer like this .	6.256527061897254

You can take a dihalide and then , you can make tri block polymer as well and for a simple case , the PDI for this sort of reaction given by this .	3.8084962400370115

So , higher the molecular weight , lower is the PDI .	7.010615423818016

A second type of living radical polymer is stable free radical polymerization .	3.376762600831239

For example , I have initiator like this .	4.9812594254985845

When it forms two radicals , this radical commonly known as tempo .	3.4376007555384143

This is very stable .	9.395980346574929

Because of these two large groups , they cannot take part in bimolecular termination reaction among themselves .	4.050875528751485

So , that is why this radical is very stable and that can be stored for days in a container which can be used later on .	3.61039562151254

So , same thing happens in this case because you have a stable radical and this can react with same form RM n dot which again undergoes reversible reaction and form the same logic , which you discuss ATIP and do the living chain polymerization .	3.3287449938767315

So , logic , all the arguments remains similar as in the case of ATIP .	3.975766649717804

Again , this is a case of reversible termination like ATIP .	5.353230197555416

Now , the third case which is RAFT , reversible addition fragmentation transfer .	3.8477869159407097

The name suggests that it take advantageous advantage of reversible transfer reaction .	2.9850769170445277

Now , in this case what happens , you have the same way you have h n come to that .	3.831294285533356

You have a chain transfer agent here which is having general structure or something and gives you the more common , most common structure .	3.674759028894871

It could be something else as well , but for time being , I will just give you the most common example .	4.0261793390247185

It is a dithio ester .	6.029400524628715

Now , if you have a radical which can undergo reversible addition to this S is a form R S , this is let us put at carbon .	3.067882950999769

Let us take one more time .	6.22444832827684

Getting little confused .	12.675428911024404

So , I have the chain transfer agent which has generic structure life .	4.549624589012494

It is dithio ester and I have a radical produced by normal thermal initiation of some other reactions , like thermal initiations AIVN of peroxide .	2.8429522247981662

Then , it can undergo reversible addition and form this differentiate make R star , this radical .	3.4400386397508687

Now , if this bond if chosen in such a way , in this case , it is higher bond that this can again reversibly fragment by homolitic cleveage .	3.195296840025812

Then , this is found , this radical can react with monomer forming M n dot .	3.950691318919285

So , this initial reaction as well as , now this can undergo similar reversible addition and common fragmentation reaction .	3.819643605469515

So , in general , we can write that it general .	4.743382201135634

So , you have a reversible , addition reversible fragmentation and this is a transfer reaction because the original radical is getting transferred and getting terminated in forming in a new radical which is a transferred reaction .	3.603094110542624

For example , a raft transfer agent is , we can give as simple example of transfer reaction .	3.585066916633091

See in case of raft reaction , what is the molecular weight ?	6.693446399496272

Again like earlier , it is the conversion multiplied by the initial mole of the monomer , and the conversion of the raft reagent plus the conversion of the initiator .	5.01713665651064

This gives you the number of chains form in case of ATIP or other reactions .	6.155320454559508

See we discussed that this is by the total initiator molecule .	7.575604769255574

Remember the expression for the ATIP ?	8.771375400344558

We had P M 0 by I 0 .	5.869469760612201

Physically , each I 0 was forming one radical and that radical was participating in a propagating chain .	3.1961097063095334

So , this gives the number of monomers reacted divided by the number of chains formed which gives you the degree of polymerization and in this case , this is the transfer reaction .	5.208657126670777

So , to include the number of radicals form , the initiator molecules which is given by if it is thermal polymerization is to 5 , this is your deficiency factor and the conversion of this .	4.8288652403845616

Because each raft agent forms one radical , so we have to come include the concentration of the raft agent as well as initiator concentration .	4.152560480078333

So , total like the case of transfer reaction , chain transfer reaction , we have included this .	5.395885403138466

In this case also , we have to include both these .	5.307262858390663

Now , because typically we use the I0 concentration much lower than the raft concentration , we can use N 0 .	3.793579056260725

This is the conversion of raft region .	6.718951671131461

Now , if we do reaction such a way that all the RAFT regions or did take part in the polymerization reaction , we choose the raft region such as , such a way that every raft reagent is participating in the transfer reaction .	2.9545906379845794

The chain transfer position for the raft reagent we use is very high , so that all raft agents can actually be participating in the chain transfer reaction .	3.209065933298043

So , P dash becomes close to 1 .	4.7934280502421736

So , finally , this becomes the raft agent concentration .	4.68569510874042

So , in this case , the molecular weight depends upon the chain transfer reagent and the chain transfer constant is much higher compared , much higher , so that all the raft agent is taking part in the chain transfer reagent and also because the concentration of the initial raft agent is much higher than original initiator radical , we can simply write the average degrees of polymerization , end of the polymerization is .	4.068983768328553

Now , with this , we will in this discussion living radical polymerization , what you will do is quickly go through different commercial polymerization .	3.2267115486156825

Now , we will do this and go little faster because this is just information , nothing more to understand .	3.744359906287324

So , we will spend little time on these examples and if you want , you can get more information of any text book or some other literature .	3.9357441557777286

This is just to complete your knowledge on the radical chain polymers .	4.008044147797928

You have studied for last 5 - 6 lectures , what is radical polymerization , radical chain polymerization and have talked about different monomer structures , but finally , it matters or it is useful if some commercial polymers have made using these techniques .	2.6633179754751835

So , once you know that there are several polymers which are made using this technique , then your learning will be complete in that sense .	3.540269412076379

Now , the simple monomer is all polyethylene and polyethylene is synthesized at high pressures and temperature above the melting temperature , its melting temperature .	2.407680617666979

Now , remember this is a gaseous reaction to polyethylene is a gas to solid form , solid polymers .	3.771205154524339

The volume change is significant .	7.1406824148185075

Now , remember we talked about the effect of pressure briefly that in that reaction , in the polymerization reaction , if the volume change is higher , then it is increasing pressure .	4.367913049549405

You can increase the reaction rate or we can make the reaction more feasible .	6.262997103815416

So , that is why in this case , the high pressure is used .	5.29103734602921

As I said that you have to keep your reaction temperature above of melting temperature in this case , so that the polymers have mobility , so that they can undergo further propagation reaction .	4.359292803970376

So , this reaction is done about the melting temperature , its continuous process and while talking about the chain transfer to the polymers , we gave examples of polyethylene because indeed chain transfer reaction happens to polymers in this case .	3.3167654663854096

So , branches are produced .	8.704320003278106

So , this is a highly branched polymer and mostly , LDPL is low density polyethylenes are produced in this case and because this is the branched structure , it is low crystalline because the polymers cannot align each other parallely .	2.954563045804449

If they are branched , they cannot align all that time .	3.465663104140568

So , the crystalline come down and once the crystalline come down , the density of polymers also come down .	3.5320332631722575

So , it is also low density .	7.410415989562242

Typical molecular for the commercial polymers are 20000 to 100000 PDI , 3 to 10 and T g of these polymers are about 120 degree of centigrade .	3.5270437011755655

T m is from 105 to 110 degree centigrade and density as a set , it is in low density one more time .	3.9155530481745853

Applications are in the most of this has very good strength , flexibility in packed resistance and these are good melt flow behavior .	3.6113617516952026

If you have good melt flow behavior , then you can do the processing easily .	4.474954987815015

The melt processing becomes easier and in this case because we talked about application of this polymers in playing .	4.40623323178991

So , blow molding , basically the molding is done by blowing higher through a molten polymers , so that thin flames that can be done easily if you have a good melt flow behavior and polyethylene ’ s are used mostly as films for packaging materials , for house hold and agricultural construction application .	2.5040700108642056

For example , whatever we commonly talked about , say polyethenes , these bags , pouches , food wraps or cloth wraps and all these things , they are made up of polyethylene .	2.321540660406826

The other examples now in this slide and the coming few slide where we are talking about other polymers , I will just mention few examples .	3.3610484048417155

Now , there are 100 of other examples , other applications , these polymers are applied .	3.6645243186337964

So , for this class , it is not possible to cover all the examples .	4.952093784037574

I will try to give the most common application of these polymers , but this and for this and for the coming polymers and there are trade names , where you by it this name , these polymers get sold in the market .	3.0826955197795267

This is a very few of trade names covered in this slide .	4.25790118146955

Polystyrene , generally this is synthesized by continuous solution process .	3.927836155678615

Some cases where you need polystyrene beads and if you are giving the suspension polymers , some cross linker vinyl benzene type compound , then you can actually make cross linked bib , polystyrene bead by suspension polymerization .	2.9417306282376643

The linear polymerization , typically useful commercial applications have molecular weight , it is 50000 to 150000 , PDI 2 to 4 and T g is around 85 degree centigrade and it is very rigid polymers because backbones is having aromatic structures .	3.049736747138559

If it is the chain is not difficult to rotate , the single becomes difficult .	4.261301666621626

So , it is rigid plastics .	5.973745625605347

So , it cannot come off .	6.777476979320449

So , it cannot crystallize .	8.043165431841931

If you want to crystallize polymer , then you have to align them next to each other parallely .	4.12297149771008

If you have rigid backbone , then it is very difficult because that is why its polystyrene is a completely amorphous polymer .	4.236366162455443

It has good strength and dimensional stability .	4.5299223612648465

It has only elongation from 1 to 3 percent .	4.328587431393863

It has very good resistance to aqueous basis and acids , but there is some problem , disadvantage in polystyrene structure too because it is an aromatic structure .	2.7969140231571807

It has poor weatheribility , it absorbs UV light and becomes yellow and it is soluble in hydrocarbon solvents .	3.5409662632009025

So , its resistance to hydrocarbon solvent is poor .	3.8182682300182784

So , often polystyrene is used with these stabilizers , UV stabilizer and also as a component or as a blend with other polymers or a co - polymer , with other monomers .	2.7376304790633172

For example , in the beginning , we talked about butylenes styrene rubber lower or in the butylenes styrene rubber as such this is the example of co polymer , very common applications of polystyrene .	3.6053245668935823

This is audiotape cassettes , office fixtures , tumbles and in medical because this styrene has an aromatic backbone .	2.3255959210881523

This is stable on a .	6.376973250596342

So , if you want is medical equipment that typically sterilize by high energy radiation by like gamma rays , so these polymer polystyrene is in use .	2.329846063767408

Medical applications like pipettes , petry dishes and medical containers and so on .	2.6327251035239687

Lot of applications of polystyrene goes as FOAM .	4.688793259250273

Foam of polymer polystyrene is found by impregnating and blowing agents , and we have seen yourself many applications of polystyrene founds like disposable drinking cups , the cushions , cushioned packaging and thermal insulator and sometimes , these cushions packaging like your labeled reagent bottles comes with some packing outside or some boxes made up of polyester in foams .	1.9722111933108823

If they were ever the unit to protect the brittle material inside like a cartoon , fast food , trays .	2.3726194515510617

These are the cheep polymers .	5.848314005266765

So , you can use this for very common applications and cross linked PS beads which can by for the suspension polymer , they can be used for chromatographic materials .	3.0372507952239025

In a chromatographic poly , these polystyrene columns are made by these , this cross linked polystyrene beads .	2.9781973929433487

So , polystyrenes have also some high end applications .	4.1422864883243955

In that sense , from the trade names by which polystyrene is sold is mentioned here Styrofoam , cellofoam , dytene and so on .	2.352204702402779

These are very few lists of the trade names we are talking about .	3.756249726749621

Next , we talk about the vinyl families and most important polymer in the vinyl family is poly vinyl chloride as generally synthesized by suspension polymerization batch process .	2.9043885622200696

It has low crystallinelity ; it has T g around 81 degrees centigrade to 80 degree centigrade .	2.7421940406845344

Now , when process this polymer at high temperature is actually evolved or produced hcl and that is very detrimental for several applications .	3.267726392471852

So , almost every applications of poly vinyl alcohol , one need to add degrees , stabilize metal oxide , fatty acids salt to basically minimize the hcl production .	2.388147294147605

Otherwise there is no practical application of PVC of polyvinyl chloride also , though it has a rigid back bone .	3.753430606263937

It has rigid plastics and also it finds several applications and there are lots of applications and in most of the applications are PVC plasticized .	3.5132495732550657

PVC plasticized means it by adding some additives which are called as plasticized T g is brought down .	3.6706844213961394

So , at room temperature , at the main temperature with PVC becomes flexible and the applications of flexible PVC are lot .	2.8546012193610455

All the pipes , most of the pipes you see in the home or other applications are made of PVC , their applications vinyl sliding like window frames , rain gutters .	2.4947016640794417

Some trade names are mentioned here .	6.104978529801753

Other families of vinyl members will not be discussed .	5.0999596029872265

I will not discuss in detail , but these are also important vinyl polymers like vinyl acetate .	3.831094023330193

Vinyl acetate utilized to vinyl alcohol to make poly vinyl alcohols .	3.6338493179074782

Polyvinyl alcohols are not produced from poly vinyl alcohol because vinyl alcohol does not exist in that .	2.903568262874633

So , poly vinyl alcohols are produced from the hydrolysis of poly vinyl acetates .	3.978256035884838

The structure is mentioned in the bottom .	6.278565895954525

So , move to the next set of polymers is acrylic families and the most important is poly methyl methaculate .	3.8076994287103396

That actually covers most of the volume of acrylic polymers and the poly methyl PM is actually synthesized by solution suspension or by emulsion polymerization .	3.0995044277422963

It is of as you can see the structure that it is having the bulky side group .	4.569443849928092

So , it is very difficult to align the chains .	4.334218214874576

These are difficult to align .	8.199819703766934

So , they are perfectly , they are completely amorphous nor crystality .	3.2087120530251227

They are Tg weather 105 degree centigrade .	4.732192013791225

They are very low refracting index which makes them exceptional having optical clarity because no aromatic group containing , so they have good weatheribility .	2.4623343235269717

They have good strength and some of the applications are in rods , safety glasses , indoor and outer lightings and optical fibres .	2.985132225829231

They are effectively slow .	7.769141806536516

So , they are used in optical fibres for light transmission , eye goggles and cd .	3.0386210018610176

The cheap cd ’ s are manufactured by compact divisional .	3.230221297791032

Some of the trade names are shown here .	4.615631282818283

The other acrylitic families are poly methyl acrylitic acids , polyacrolomite poly acrylic acid and poly acronitral .	2.4918351791344584

Polymerization is slight like vinyl carbozole and in vinyl phirilidin phirilidone .	2.9300994355424628

So , they are also used by the monomers which are also polymerized by radical polymerization .	4.893836022541183

So , with this , what we come to the end of this module on radical polymerization .	4.178777642690611

Now , what we will do in next 5 - 10 minutes is just to give the summary or recollect your memory , basically the most important points of the radical chain polymerization which we discussed in that 5 - 6 - 7 class lectures .	3.1377853121520007

So , radical chain polymerization as we can see from our discussion that radical chain polymerizations are comparatively easiest to carry out in respect or in comparison to the step - growth polymerization ; provided you take care of the solvent , if you are using a solvent and any impurity which can terminate the radicals or any impurities which can act as a chain transfer agent .	3.3394973528570917

So , if you can minimize these impurities , the chain transfer agent or any vital which actually kills the radicals , then you can have this radical polymerization process done easily .	3.1997334985493895

Now , as you have seen we discussed the radical polymerization is done mostly for the double bond containing monomers , but not all the monomers which contain the double bond can be polymerized radically , and that depends on both the thermo dynamic and kinetic factor .	3.4770566497714244

Thermeric factor we discussed two lectures back that if polymerizability of a monomer in radical chain , polymerization is mainly governed by the enthalpy value , deluge value , not deluge value , and the deluge value , it depends on whether the monomer is stabilized , whether it is electronically or hypercongication or resonance .	2.6442710193140972

If it is stabilized , then the deluge value comes down .	3.688851704239013

If the polymer produced from this molecule is strained , highly strained , then also deluge value comes down .	2.7879245680469436

So , we showed the examples of alpha methyl styrene or 1 1 1 2 or 1 1 2 di substrate monomers like a mallian hydrie , where these radical polymerization becomes difficult and that is all any factor , kinetic factor also plays if the resulting radicals cannot approach each other , radicals produced or propagating radicals cannot approach a monomer .	2.313675723683578

For example , in case of 1 2 di substitute reaction , then the polymerization becomes difficult .	4.718628139171363

The hydrie initiator you should choose such a way that the reactions happened in the model rate , so that the temperature which you are planning to reaction or rather you choose your polymerization reaction temperature such a way that the half life of your initiator is somewhat between , say your reaction time frame .	2.8130782061584645

It should be too low .	6.512307737814175

So , the reaction is too fast or it should not be too slow .	4.841279447423088

That reaction is very slow and we have talked about these equations several times and the rate of polymerization and the kinetic chain length which is related to the molecular weight or number of decreases the polymerization .	4.23953491439662

In both cases , if you increase the volume molecular concentration of the monomer , the molecules weight as well as the rate of the polymerization increases , but when we try to do that , while that by carrying out the reaction is the bulk condition where you get a maximum concentration of the monomer .	4.305577855281752

The other complication arises like increasing a viscosity or lot of heat generation .	2.8980097530463453

So , it is not always possible to increase the monomer concentration .	5.601060591701083

If you want to increase the reaction rate by increasing temperature , we have found out that it does increase the reaction rate in most cases , but in the simultaneous , it also decreases the molecular weight .	3.667181126858156

If you have the chain transfer reagents are present , chain transfer reaction actually limit the molecular built and more the amount of chain transformation , lower is the molecular weight and we have seen that .	4.055459126527024

You can actually take advantage if you can do this chain transfer or chain termination by reversible way , where you can utilize this reversible chain transfer termination reaction and carryout leaving reaction and carryout a leaving radical polymerization , where your poly dispersity index is much lower compared to the normal polymer radical .	2.8995680838389037

Polymerization has also the polymers remain leaving at the end of the polymers .	4.046498031579781

So , we can utilize this by making block co - polymers by design of the second monomer at the end of the reaction and also , we talked about the different polymerization process like bulk suspension , emulsion , dispersion solution , different types of processes and the advantages and disadvantages of all these processes and at the beginning of your requirement , you should choose the polymerization process which suit you the most and at the end , we discussed few examples of the commercial polymers which is synthesized using this radical chain polymerization technique .	3.128857866905482

So , with this , we conclude our module on radical chain polymerization and what we will do , what we will start in the next lecture is ionic polymerization .	3.8935561692043588

Why ? Basically , in state of radical , this chain polymerization will be initiated by ionic species whether it is an ion cationic or an anionic species .	3.3095924884944927

So , with this , we will end this lecture today and will begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization in the next class , next lecture .	3.7203747022028226

Today we will be talking about the role of effector molecules in the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	4.263597756398929

You will recall that so far we have seen the role substrate molecules play to influence the rate of an enzymatic reaction .	3.775502629502333

They bind with the enzyme and have dynamic complexes that ultimately break down to form the product .	3.84968572967562

Now this complex , enzyme substrate complex formation can be effected by a number of other external molecules which are not really directly the players in the enzyme reactions .	3.741921446681337

That means neither they are substrate may or may not be products and such molecules are called effector molecules .	2.847833535439436

Those molecules whose presence in a reaction mixture influences the rate of reaction , if it is in increasing the rate of reaction we call them as activators if it is decreasing the reaction rate , we call them inhibitors .	4.163860278350348

The role of these molecules is very important in the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions for certain reasons .	4.320790546275876

One is that they give you a picture on the reaction rate in the presence of those molecules .	5.134964829327298

You can regulate the reaction rate to an enhanced value or to a decreased value in the presence of those molecules .	3.3182982541396258

In fact in the living cells also these molecules provide a regulatory device to control the rate of reaction .	3.1182048372900018

We will see when we go on subsequently how many of the molecules control the rate of reaction by inhibiting or activating a particular enzyme in the beginning of a metabolic pathway .	3.7767193483636308

Most of the information on the architecture of the active sites , which are the functional groups that are present on the active sites or the mechanism of the specificity , has resulted from the understanding of the interaction of inhibitor molecules or activator molecules in the enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.5876397308492334

Particularly in the case of multisubstrate reactions which we will be dealing subsequently where more than one substrate molecule takes part in the enzyme catalyzed reaction their kinetic mechanism is also understood by the role of certain external effector molecules .	3.535759153553195

That is another major advantage .	6.7656926387644445

So these are the issues that provide us a very important understanding towards the role of effector molecules .	3.3195843557297775

But even on the practical aspect probably from the industrial aspect also effector molecules are very important because in large number of drugs and the preservatives that are used commercially they basically work on the principle of modulating the enzyme reaction rate .	2.526148489039557

We are aware of many of the sulphur drugs .	5.45751114536393

In fact all the sulphur drugs are basically inhibitors of one or the other enzyme operating in the living system .	2.9590798698887464

The only care that is taken in designing a drug is that the particular molecule which acts as an inhibitor for a particular toxic substance or let us say for an infection should not be toxic to the human beings .	3.1306516736446146

Most of the materials that we use , whether they are sulphur drugs or antibiotics , they are inhibitors or activators of certain enzymes .	2.4092263458525243

So from that point of view , understanding their interaction is quite important .	3.87620152546251

Activators are molecules , as name suggest , that enhance the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.7995662305600733

Some of the activator molecules may be absolutely essential for a given enzyme reaction .	3.8040552176854203

Some may not be so .	9.689317557043154

They may only provide stability to enzyme substrate complex .	4.018223036669713

Therefore the nature of activator molecules might differ from case to case .	3.6997709258077496

Typical examples of some of the activators are for example in the case of alpha amylase , calcium ions act as activators which is known to stabilize the enzyme substrate complex .	3.46581149739741

In the absence of calcium ions , the enzyme substrate complex is not very stable or the dissociation constant of enzyme substrate complex is relatively high and therefore the rate of reaction will be very , very slow .	4.379138438060988

That is another example of an absolute requirement of an activator .	4.254437823031143

In the absence of magnesium ions the enzyme will not be functionally catalytically active and therefore these activators function by participating or facilitating in either enzyme substrate binding or in stabilizing the enzyme substrate complex .	2.65313140464675

The difference between cofactors and activators is a cofactor will have to participate in the catalytic mechanism .	3.2598942026194155

Take for example a cofactor like a NAD .	4.446660001720366

It is used in the oxidation reduction reactions and in the absence of any such residue in the active site which can participate in the oxidation reduction reaction , the NAD provides a molecule which undergoes redox reaction and therefore catalyzes the reaction .	3.0513640735461376

It also plays a role in substrate binding and the role of cofactor is absolutely essential .	3.6858943583794623

The reaction cannot take place in the absence of cofactor whereas in the case of activator we are only enhancing the rate .	3.870176152283658

The rate may not come to zero .	5.133750396023978

It might have a very small insignificant rate in the absence of an activator and in the presence , the rate might enhance .	4.664297696149589

Mg2 + is an absolute requirement .	8.018659603024005

So it falls in the category of both actually .	4.093282289718859

It also participates in the catalytic mechanism .	5.438404243931002

True example of activators will be calcium ions which do not take part in the catalytic function but provides stability to enzyme substrate complex .	3.104673740834197

That means binding process is facilitated .	5.825722551387422

So magnesium is something on interface .	4.945515733841777

Looking at activators from the mechanistic point of view , the role of activators can be considered as binding to the enzyme molecule to give you an activated enzyme .	3.9419793684899465

When the activator molecule binds to it , the EA complex becomes an active enzyme complex .	3.4391593853041424

This EA complex will bind with the substrate which is the active enzyme substrate complex .	6.115457956924831

This enzyme substrate complex can break down to the active enzyme plus product with k1 , k - 1 and k2 .	4.028734867562601

If we consider that the dissociation constant of activator binding to the enzyme is Ka , then in that case the rate of such reaction can be expressed as Vi = Vm .S Km { 1 + Ka / A } + S You ultimately end up in a rate expression in which the Km term is modified .	4.029729800164202

This can be written as Vm .	6.993226108738155

One can also see that the modified Km value is Km ’ = Km { 1 + Ka / A } That is when A becomes very , very large the activator concentration present in the reaction is much larger in comparison to Ka .	3.447839979843525

That means when we have sufficient quantity of activator present as required , the K ’ m approaches to that of intrinsic Km or K ’ m / Km = 1 .	3.0458856940780508

Also when the activator is zero or when there is no activator present , the enzyme reaction will not take place because modified Km value will be too large .	3.5520353927899584

There will be no effective binding taking place and that means the secondary step will be ruled out .	3.3456455995538152

Therefore the activator molecules can influence the reaction rate in an enzyme catalyzed process by this simple way to modify the Km value .	3.9725020957186956

The second category of effector molecules that we noted was inhibitors .	3.46891767997825

As the name suggests , these are those molecules which decrease the rate of an enzyme catalyzed reactions when present in the reaction mixture .	4.2096954435265515

They form complexes with enzyme molecule , enzyme substrate molecule , both or one of them .	3.29733548840173

They form dynamic complexes with the enzyme and enzyme substrate complexes and thereby influence the rate of reaction .	3.680833156480924

The inhibition patterns or inhibitors can be classified into two main classes .	3.684700241604113

One is irreversible inhibitors , which means that the inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in an irreversible fashion and cannot be recovered or revoked by physical operations .	3.413746757995976

Very often when into a reaction mixture if you have added an inhibitor molecule , one can remove it by physical method say for example by dialysis or ultra filtration or any of those methods .	3.0103066299467867

But irreversible inhibitors cannot be removed once added to a reaction mixture and their effect is irreversible .	2.973283030810072

That means ultimately they will tend to reduce the rate of reaction and provide a poisonous effect on the rate of reaction .	3.88746252722046

In fact some times there are also called catalytic poisons because they irreversibly poison the catalyst .	2.5596309171214595

In most of the cases the effect is such that the reaction rate or catalytic function of the enzyme approaches to inactive form and thereby they cannot be used for catalytic functions .	4.438685978871115

Reversible inhibition is caused by chemical modification of one of the amino acids residues on the active site .	3.889089690878725

Most of the chemical modification reagents that are used for modification of the enzyme active sites do play a role in the irreversible inhibition .	4.323159663210748

Most of the alkylating agents will alkylate some of the amino acids residues and thereby make the enzyme inactive .	3.155404470756381

Many of the heavy metals like mercury or some of the poisonous gases also have the same action of irreversible inhibition whereby saving the person become difficult .	2.6239790616779812

The role of irreversible inhibitors can be expressed as ki kin E + I EI Einac k - i The first step shows a reversible process but the process doesn ’ t stop here .	2.3357280977034245

Once EI is formed it goes into an inactive first order irreversible step which inactivates the enzyme and the concentration of EI at any given time can be expressed as EI = ( E0 - EI ) .I / ki where ki is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor and then one can write the inactivation rate as Vi = Kin [ EI ] = kin E0 / 1 + ki / I Therefore if I is in excess , if the magnitude of inhibitor is in excess , such that you can consider that there is a constant , then the whole expression is a first order rate constant that is kd.E0 where kd a first order rate constant assuming that I is in excess and can be considered as constant .	3.026395521039519

Such reactions are very often noted to be poisonous in nature .	4.156924486342897

Most of the substances that are technically called poisons whether it is mercury or cyanide or nerve gas and things like that they all behave in the form of irreversible inhibitors .	2.5337294005172732

Except to understand their role to evolve methods to prevent the poisoning they don ’ t have much of industrial value .	2.926245364005671

It is mostly reversible inhibitors which play a key role in most of the industrial processes .	3.8047091355788103

In the second category of reversible inhibitors , the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a reversible manner .	3.8027353676751976

That means after the addition of the inhibitor to an enzyme substrate mixture one can physically remove it .	3.607226520000362

The physical methods most commonly used are ultra filtration or dialysis such that the enzyme is fully restored to its initial activity .	3.4169733772554367

In the presence of inhibitor their activity will be decreased but once you remove it physically , the original activity of the enzyme is recovered .	3.5671407517993443

In a sense these molecules make dynamic complexes with the enzyme which have different catalytic properties to that of the native enzyme .	3.495421968956717

Different inhibitor molecules bind differently to the enzyme molecule or enzyme substrate complex such that the catalytic properties are altered and thereby the rate of reaction is altered .	4.10530435345872

Our total orientation to study the inhibitors will be mostly directed towards the understanding the reversible inhibition .	2.814755082368816

There are certain general patterns which we follow in studying reversible inhibition and before we go to the individual cases I like to highlight that .	2.7695834178915217

The first thing that we must look at is the pattern of binding of inhibitor to enzyme or enzyme substrate complex .	3.512027857111705

How does a particular group of inhibitors bind to the enzyme molecules ?	4.456726624456664

You are proposing an operational reaction mechanism which may be slightly different than that proposed by Michaelis Menten or others earlier as we discussed and that mechanism need to be understood very clearly and that will give you a physical picture of the enzyme substrate binding .	3.1977993880610276

The second thing is , on the basis of this binding process you develop a rate expression .	4.06145764113667

We always tend to compare a rate of expression with that of Michaelis Menten rate expression .	3.903676517669348

Then look at the effect of the inhibitor concentration on Km or Vm or both of the reaction .	4.83715784607137

First we have looked at the binding pattern .	6.3718173844178745

Based on the binding pattern , we develop a rate expression compare it to the Michaelis Menten equation and see how the Km and Vm of the native enzyme are influenced by the presence of inhibitors .	3.5710308538961915

Then we see the effect on Lineweaver Burk plot .	6.014747749572022

That is another basic expression of kinetic behavior in the case of enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.9225880151984414

If a double reciprocal plot is plotted between 1 / S and 1 / V as a function of inhibitor concentration how does this represent ?	3.145385058632132

Fifthly another important pattern is for each class of inhibition , there is degree of inhibition .	3.0484739637124414

That means we define a term degree of inhibition called i which is nothing but v0 - vi / v0 .	3.703587646725252

If v0 is the rate of uninhibited reaction , classically Michaelis Menten kinetics , and vi is the rate expression for inhibited reaction , the degree of inhibition that is produced by the presence of inhibitor is obtained even from a theoretical rate expression .	3.4561347907991378

You can work out an expression for degree of inhibition and that will have a characteristic pattern which can distinguish a particular type of a reversible inhibition .	3.469409725784537

All other reversible inhibition studies will be based on these five approaches in general .	3.0712338563771526

Probably one of the simplest and the most commonly encountered pattern of reversible inhibition is what we know as competitive inhibition .	4.2158992137556135

As the name suggests , competitive inhibitor combines with the free enzyme on the same site which is the substrate binding site and therefore the inhibitor competes for the binding site with the substrate .	4.120215613011094

Usually both inhibitor and substrate molecules are mutually exclusive and compete with each other .	3.195488769315088

The inhibitor binding site on the enzyme molecule and substrate binding site on the enzyme molecule are identical .	4.529851543405758

This should be taken in a very broad sense .	7.713241729704982

It is not always necessary that the binding site has to be exactly the same as that of substrate .	4.615226608305131

The purpose is that the presence of inhibitor makes the binding of the substrate difficult in a competitive mode .	4.076171579393066

That means the proximity may be such that the inhibitor molecule has such a confirmation that the original binding site is disturbed and substrate binding is not feasible or alternatively after binding of the inhibitor molecule the substrate binding site might be modified in such a way that substrate binding is not feasible .	2.726273751266441

All those cases , variety of cases will come under the category of competitive inhibition and the purpose is that the presence of inhibitor must reduce because reversible inhibition depends on the concentrations of the two species , inhibitor and substrate and they will affect the binding mechanism .	3.2681771193238833

A very typical example and probably the most easily understood example is of oxidation of succinic acid to fumaric acid .	2.9168926868733167

SDH CH2 - COOH H - C - COOH + FAD + FADH2 CH2 - COOH HOOC - C - H This enzyme is succinic dehydrogenase , SDH .	2.259145483763171

This is inhibited by a molecule closely resembling the substrate , malonic acid which has two carboxyl groups but only one methyl group , unlike succinic acid .	2.3063891513850674

It is very similar in confirmation and very often enzyme active site mistakes it for succinic acid and therefore it acts as a competitive inhibitor in the same reaction .	3.5365027840485577

It acts as a competitive inhibitor for folic acid biosynthesis from para amino benzoic acid .	2.8066877305369884

The amino group on the aromatic ring is identical in both the molecules .	4.033967276486633

This is sulfanilamide and this is para amino benzoic acid .	4.6589757524272075

This para amino benzoic acid is the starting substrate for synthesis of folic acid .	3.1524922569991567

This synthesis is inhibited by this inhibitor .	5.699363639381041

Such a synthetic reaction route although takes place in microbial systems does not take place in the human beings .	3.1242789726260254

Therefore this acts as a very potent sulpha drug .	4.778228135294192

This reaction is not available in the human beings but since microbial systems are totally dependent on synthesis of folic acids it can easily inhibit the growth of microorganism and sulfanilamide is a very potent antibacterial agent in the case of human systems .	2.6934390289795638

If you look for the reaction scheme or the binding pattern which is followed by competitive inhibitors we can write the first stage as enzyme substrate binding .	3.643832171575253

We can consider the dissociation constant of ES as km .	4.918477353181624

When I say km I am referring to k - 1 + k2 / k1 .	4.8473491424900494

It is analogous to dissociation constant .	5.2831568286240715

Just for simplicity I have written here and this is k2 .	5.09554605518643

This is ki , the dissociation constant for the inhibitor .	5.881263729684547

ki = E.I / EI km = E.S / ES You can write the rate expression for such a binding mechanism and the rate expression will come out to be S S v0 / vm = = km ( 1 + I / ki ) + S k ’ m + S Now if you compare it to Michaelis Menten equation which is S / k ’ m + S .	3.726421218598811

Just like an activator molecule , here also the km gets modified to a new value 1 + I / ki and therefore as the concentration of I increases the value of km also increases and the affinity decreases for the substrate .	3.1763190684050766

The modified Michaelis Menten constant in the presence of inhibitor is k ’ m = km ( 1 + I / ki ) So you notice here that the Km changes by a magnitude 1 + I / Ki but the Vm remains unchanged , Vm.S on the numerator ; there is no change in the magnitude of Vm .	3.1905228062553874

Maximum reaction velocity remains the same but the km changes .	4.651389317731529

That is a very typical feature of identifying a competitive inhibitor .	4.411756540544746

If you make a double reciprocal Lineweaver - Burk plot between one upon substrate concentration verses one upon reaction velocity , 1 / S Vs 1 / V , at different inhibitor concentrations , you will notice that with increasing inhibitor concentration the value of km will undergo change .	2.8302809647242966

km will tend to increase or the slope of the profile will increase without affecting the point of intersection on y - axis which is represented as 1 / Vi .	3.2196565299244826

If you write the double reciprocal equation for the same thing , what we wrote earlier 1 / vo = km / Vm ( 1 + I / ki ) .1 / S + 1 / Vm If you plot 1 / S verses 1 / vo you get a series of profiles with increasing I .	3.821399286885752

The slope increases but the magnitude of 1 / Vm remains unaltered .	5.497351099511922

That is what we notice .	9.05860702890366

Another fact is if one were interested to determine the value of ki in comparison to km and Vm and the characteristic pattern of inhibition , you can use the double reciprocal plot as a basis for determining the value of ki .	3.454443627102596

If you look at the slope of reciprocal plot slope is Slope = km / Vm ( 1 + I / ki ) = km / Vm.ki.I + km / Vm If you get a secondary plot where you plot the value of slope , obtained from the primary double reciprocal plot , as a function of inhibitor concentration you will again end up in a straight line with the slope of km / Vm.ki .	3.2286001431899254

km and Vm is the slope at I = 0 which is already known to us and therefore the magnitude of ki can be easily determined .	4.352152891189215

Similarly you can also plot the apparent km .	6.136504710336181

So either you can plot apparent km or you can plot slope .	5.056875207184073

It will be entirely the same thing .	5.1894506461750245

Therefore one can get the magnitude of ki by plotting a secondary plot .	5.2321937101257605

So to summarize the competitive inhibition , we must notice that the inhibitor molecule binds to an enzyme molecule at a site either on the same side which is ear marked for substrate molecule or at a site in proximity to it in such a way that it interferes or restricts the binding of the substrate molecule onto the enzyme site and therefore it competes for the binding process on the enzyme molecule .	3.017240798363202

There is no binding of the inhibitor molecule with the enzyme substrate molecule once the substrate molecule has bound to the enzyme , the inhibitor is ineffective .	4.897365908819753

That means the total enzyme concentration is distributed between inhibitor and substrate and that is one .	4.822578422084388

Second thing is the enzyme catalyzed reaction in the presence of a competitive inhibitor results in an increased km value and the Vm value is totally not affected .	4.013003100980015

Third thing is that the effect of the competitive inhibitor can be successfully overcome to a significant extent if you increase the substrate concentration to a very large value as compared to inhibitor concentration .	4.010264488203073

Because they are competing on the same side , if the concentration of substrate is much , much larger than inhibitor then the possibility of substrate molecule binding to enzyme is much more and once substrate molecule is bound the enzyme will no longer be available for inhibitor to act upon .	3.170146775128611

Finally the double reciprocal plot of 1 / S verses 1 / V at different inhibitor concentrations followed by a secondary plot of slope verses inhibitor concentration can be used to determine the magnitude of km , Vm and ki for a reaction which involves competitive inhibitor .	2.9888828917774966

We will stop at this point .	4.181671791906674

Welcome back to the course on polymer chemistry and in today ' s class .	3.9018686373890636

How we can use the knowledge from solubility parameter and we can estimate or predict the solubility behavior of a polymer in a solvent .	4.156694295612943

And then we will follow up our discussion with a phase separation behavior of polymer solutions .	3.1609223733745195

Now , let us begin just recapping few minutes what we discussed in last class or last lecture .	3.0810403733461142

Now , this is what we found we derived the Flory - Huggins equation where now this is Gibbs free energy of mixing given by two terms this term was coming from purely combinatorial entropy and this is always negative .	3.2541651466230457

And so this is always favors mixing this is always gives you negative contribution towards Gibbs free energy mixing , this is always favors mixing .	3.248217952691634

And this coming from a combination of enthalpy and entropy change due to polymer solvents contacts .	3.3587570247482237

And it will decide because it is always negative and it is always contribute in favor of mixing .	4.906828829656155

So , the value of this basically determines where polymer will mix or becomes soluble in a solvent or not .	3.407219796574473

And if the value becomes less than zero negative obviously mixing will happen , if it is positive and large no mixing and if it is slightly positive small I did not change from .	2.980040053766206

So , this is if it slightly positive and this is and the value is small and it depends between the completion of this two to which will decide whether the polymers will go in to solution or not .	3.254020185335809

In dilute polymer solution we had found that the excess contribution excess chemical potential , we got this relationship .	3.5726006245583077

And at related temperature this term the contribution of excess chemical potential becomes 0 and the solutions become ideally .	2.8138143163744473

If you look at this expression if this contributes negatively , obviously mu 1 this difference would be lower than the ideal .	2.959928830764643

That means polymer will the solution or the mixture of polymer and the solvent will be favored , if this is positive then it will be higher than the value of ideal .	4.717288743598819

So , it will be it will have effect against solution .	4.87798128640856

So , theta temperature the this becomes 0 , so the solutions become ideal solutions and polymer exist in solution with unperturbed dimensions .	2.554755657874497

Now , we will come in a next lecture what is unperturbed dimensions , but what does it mean in brief as if polymers are present as such without no interference or no interaction from the other polymer molecule or the solvent molecule , which will discuss what the meaning of unperturbed dimensions in detail in next lecture .	2.6204800157381616

Obviously as I said that when theta is temperature is theta temperature value of polymer solvent interaction parameter chi becomes 0.5 .	3.3297236356325692

So , the solution will be the polymer and solvent mix like ideal solution , if this is if the value of chi becomes lower than half then the coil expands polymer expands in solution , which promotes mixing .	3.5506747546039876

Psi was if you recollect the this was entropy parameter now to have this term negative , for a positive entropy factor or parameter , T has to higher than the theta temperature to have mixing .	2.474559769028179

Whereas , if the entropy factor is negative than T has to be lower than the theta temperature to have mixing possible .	3.3178556741347527

And the other cases , where the opposite case or the reverse case where chi polymer solvent interaction parameter is higher than 0.5 , it against mixing .	3.1982621167640763

Just to give few data for polymer solvent polymer solvent system having different values of i and theta… Let us look at some data of different polymers and with different solvents as we are mentioning , for all this cases the interaction parameter value chi is less than 0.5 .	2.5691319599988334

That means this is all this examples we are talking about favoring mixing so as I mentioned , if psi is positive then for mixing to happen temperature has to be higher than theta .	3.507136534754266

And examples where there are strong interaction between the solvent and the polymer , the entropy factor becomes negative .	4.994032072080983

In that case the temperature has to be lower than the theta temperature to have the mixing possible .	4.124920103512476

And these are two examples where the psi factor is negative and theta has to be lower than theta two to get the mixing possible .	3.627740260677443

Now , let us move to the one more topic on solubility which is determined cohesive energy density and solubility parameter .	2.7087581015102296

Now , if you look back the Flory - Huggins expression we have two terms the first term from the combinatorial entropy , which can predict theoretically if you know the volume fractions of the polymer and the number of moles of the polymer molecules .	3.7274228483788394

The second term which actually determines the polymer will get solubilized in the solvent , you need to find out the value of that .	4.133586969209941

And there are some approach some approaches from the different , different scientist made and one of the important and important contribution from this towards this is by Hildebrand , Hildebrand who basically introduced the concept of cohesive energy density… And relations to solubility parameter , and this is simple way to predict the solubility of polymer in a solvent and miscibility also can predict the miscibility the behavior of polymer polymer system .	2.716663820010742

And we also can because it as if it can determine the solubility of polymer , it can also simultaneously detect the solvent resistance behavior of the polymer .	3.8382432673598

It mainly useful for as we see it is mainly useful for non - polar solvents and non - polar amorphous polymers , it is not very useful for polar molecules and polar solvents .	3.1136612730223074

It is basically a semi - empirical approach as suggested by Hildebrand following the principle like dissolves like .	2.7569672292723966

This means basically as we know that like the polymers which are a similar structure or similar sort of interaction behavior with a solvent will dissolve in that solvent .	3.3247780354301866

Quantitably this cohesive energy density is defined by this which is delta E v is molar energy of vaporization , it can be written by this expression also where delta H v sub v is molar energy of enthalpy of vaporization , this is molar energy of vaporization and this is molar enthalpy of vaporization v is the molar volume of the substance .	2.985111694072874

Now , as you know cohesive energy is basically , it gives idea about the interaction or the force of attraction between the similar type of molecule .	3.1624905582792726

So , if the cohesive energy density is the higher than the attraction of the attraction between the similar molecules is higher .	3.1862492345942357

So , as we know from our previous understanding that cohesive energy is the energy of interaction between the similar molecules .	4.320261858038442

So , higher cohesive energy density means higher attraction between the molecules .	4.137057698165616

Now , one defined the term solubility parameter which is basically square root of cohesive energy density .	4.024245519664801

So it is given by this expression and this is what we are looking for the enthalpy of mixing is given by , if you know the values of the solubility parameter then the enthalpy of mixing can be obtained by this expression .	4.615801863829572

We know the contribution from the combinatorial entropy which is always favoring mixing .	4.094023535619257

Now , this is the term will give you the enthalpy of mixing the way this expression has been proposed , it always gives the entropy the enthalpy of mixing .	3.792856097064823

Enthalpy of mixing del H m is positive or 0 , if delta 1 is equals to delta 2 the drawback of these approach is that it cannot predict any negative enthalpy of mixing , which sometimes happen if there are strong specific interaction between the polymer and the solvent .	3.0974887553184764

V m is the average molar volume of the polymer and the solvent .	7.123643160559422

So , if you if you think about the Gibbs energy of mixing which is delta H minus 3 delta s .	3.6820772962860886

So , obviously the lower is the value of delta h the better is the mixing and if it is negative then obviously it favors the most in this case because it is positive or 0 , then the case where delta H mixing would be 0 , it will be most favorable for mixing .	3.4242252371962176

And if it is positive then the lower is the value of delta H sub m it will be it will be better for mixing .	4.103521278968212

So , as Hildebrand suggests that that compatibility between components one which is the solvent and two which is the solute the polymer in this case arises , as you have the less differences between the solubility parameter of the two components .	4.385722343011806

So , if this they are same that is the best case where delta H m would be equals to 0 .	4.1854976186380775

Now , we have we have seen before that the polymer solvent interaction parameter can is actually have two component , the entropy component and enthalpy component .	3.0817869478472772

It can be shown that enthalpy component is can be expressed by this expression as well , and this term entropic contribution towards the polymer solvent interaction parameter is most cases , it happens the value of 0.2 .	3.566700459713535

So , if this is close to or at least less than 0.3 then chi would be less than 0.5 , which means it will promote mixing and which means the closer this the value of delta 1 and delta 2 .	3.472561902080411

Then obviously the difference it will be nearer to 0 the chi H value would be nearer to 0 .	3.4323069047857353

So , from this expression also you can predict that the polymer solvent interaction parameter will be lower than 0.5 , which means the polymer will promote or it will dissolve in the solvent you are using .	4.471577895699725

Now as I said that before that this box will for polymers of or for a non - polar solvent the non - polar amorphous polymer .	3.223347869308216

It is not valid for crystalline polymers because you know this , this expression or this approach we are talking about talks about liquid solvent and liquid polymer .	3.1924530852012496

Means amorphous polymer so in if you want to dissolve a crystalline polymer then you have to also include the contribution for the enthalpy of crystallization .	3.658535204285891

So , in this case the enthalpy of crystallization is not taken in to account .	3.4173101678729787

So , that is why this is this approach is not valid for crystalline polymers this is added already for amorphous polymer .	3.3511796742996665

In case of polar solvent you can have specific interaction between the polymer and the solvent .	4.8445291802081085

For example , it can have hydrogen bonding , it can participate in the electrostatic interaction and which we can think that if there is specific interaction like hydrogen bonding attraction between polymer , and solvent .	3.4668617820809873

Then there is a possibility that there is H mixing would be negative and that as it approach the solubility parameter approach , does not predict any value any negative value of delta H mixing .	3.0249790478485536

So , this is not valid for polymer long polar a polar polymer and polar solvent as usually , which is usually valid for non polar solvent and non polar and non polar amorphous and non polar solvent .	2.823147957487141

Obviously as we you can recollect this the delta can the cohesive delta is the we see square root we see the cohesive density and cohesive energy density can be found from molar energy of vaporization or molar enthalpy of vaporization .	2.3104640135830046

For liquids or for solvents we can experimentally determine the molar enthalpy of vaporization and the molar volume .	2.9374923937136774

So , you can get the cohesive energy density and the value for the solubility parameter as well .	4.758135704624102

But for polymers because they cannot be vaporizable vaporize or polymers are not vaporizable , you cannot experimentally get the value of solubility parameter for the polymer because they are large in size .	3.600827763380683

So , they are the value of delta the solubility parameter of polymer are typically determined indirectly and it is basically following the approach , we took delta H becomes 0 as delta 1 , delta 2 becomes same .	3.0455642530206632

So , a polymers are added if talking about linear polymer then the intrinsic viscosity of that polymer is measured in several solvents , several common solvents .	2.986893010790605

And the highest or the maximum intrinsic which is the in which the solvent in which the polymer gives , we the solubility parameter of the polymer is taken as the same solubility parameter of that particular solvent .	4.373223380484213

Basically this indirectly telling that the delta 1 , delt 2 are same .	3.4767359294843048

So , this give giving the maximum solubility or maximum intrinsic viscosity for that polymer if the polymers are crops linked or jelt , then we do the same experiment take the polymer and do series of put the polymer need to work in series of solvent and find out the maximum swelling ability .	2.621714269307479

If the where that interaction is maximum , the maximum swelling happens .	3.3571452365816588

So , we take the solubility parameter of that particular solvent as the solubilitic parameter of the given polymer .	3.5438050282103823

The value of solubility parameter of the polymers can be also indirectly obtained from group contribution method .	4.4868461118680125

As you know the group contribution methsods are utilized to find out theoretically , the value for several other parameters several other properties of polymer .	3.676123642954761

And this solubility parameter can be also obtained by group contribution method , and this how it is done there particularly the solubility… This is done theoritically delta is this , F is the contribution form or the value for different groups .	2.6961688159026123

If you can divide or bisects the polymer into different parts then these values for F are available in literature .	2.725803037612061

So , you can add those and this is molar volume so you can also write this as density and molecular width , F can be on F value of F so given by a small an Hoy and this looks at one example we take P M M A poly method calculate the structure of which is as you know this is the structure .	3.209980189328544

So , how many groups it has we have to count groups there 2 C H 3 groups 1 C H 2 group .	3.1394085268542593

So , 1 C H 2 group 1 C O group and one motoring carbon in case of these are the groups there in this polymer , then values of these are separate these the contribution of these groups have already tabulated or theoretically find out by scientists like Small and Hoy , you have to just take those values and add up to get the this value .	2.8032753487752426

And then get the solubility value the F value which has been supplied in literature for this is 303.4 .	3.4706447281383506

So , this gives you 269 .	9.568954893730549

So , sum up 1609.5 , so delta would be given by multiplied the density 1.19 and by the molar mass , mass of the repeating unit .	3.4449985012750672

Now , look at these values of the groups as I said that this is this gives this , basically the solubility parameter is basically the square root of the cohesive energy density .	4.181670091268806

And cohesive density energy is nothing but measure for the interaction or attractive interaction between the molecules .	3.5794801130600824

If there are polar molecules , obviously the are attraction between the similar molecules become higher .	2.840282084487878

So , the contribution become higher and if the volume becomes higher theres no polar groups the volume becomes higher there is more Vander Wall forces between them which also , increases the cohesive interaction between the groups .	2.644814105089936

So , this C H 3 has higher than C H 2 than the votronic carbon atom this is the size of the group so the size increases Wander Walls force is increases so increases .	2.7019722269049997

So , the value of or fluctuation for this group increases .	4.2702442591588925

So , like this you can get the value for this interaction parameter for any of the polymers because the value of this are supplied by available in the literature .	4.401784458905373

Now , look at sum of the final sum of the polymers and solvent common solvent like acetone delta value 20.3 c c l 6 , this example of take few polymer like polystyrene , this is some polymer polystyrene 18.5 and bis phenyl poly carbonate its around 19.5 to 20 .	2.611989374846451

Obviously if you look at this number 19.5 and to 20 this number 19.5 to 20 , obviously look at this , this solvents .	3.8826904208140047

Now , as we have seen that if the delta value of the polymer is closer to the value of solvent that of solvent liquid that of mixing the polymer will be soluble in that solvent .	4.336481779264528

Obviously polycarbonate will not be soluble in methanol water or some of the non polar solvents , cyclohexene and sides carbon tetrachloride zylene and so on .	3.213897378786804

Acetone 20.3 is basically this polycarbonate becomes soil it ’ s not very good solvent for polycarbonate , but it is it is also a very non solvent either .	3.570723686092352

So , the solubility of polycarbonate is a very low , but it ’ s is not zero in acetone .	3.896717845969198

So , if basically if you know the solvents and the value of polycarbonate you can predict , you can estimate the whatever , whatever you want to know which application .	3.988328104128169

For example , if you want to use some medical devices you know you in medical devices , like cringes and some other medical component like you most cases before use they are sterilized by applying some spirit rectified spirit , which contains alcohol .	2.0993848051254327

If you know the solubility parameter of that alcohol then you know what are the , you can estimate or you can basically zero down , narrow down the choices of your polymer which will not be soluble in that alcohol , which will be use wiping those or sterilizing those equipment .	3.2788778815277664

So , you can basically , reduce your number experiment which can , which you can already your choice of polymer by a prior knowledge of solubility parameter , and some value of solubility solvent and polymer .	2.746244022581027

Some cases this rubber gaskets are used for sealant in may be in aircraft applications , where a ceiling is very important .	2.9201773149157177

Now , obviously they come in case of car also they clients are very important .	4.331070740397206

So , how they come in the contact of the petroleum vapours , or they come in contact with liquid fuel .	3.253153702919739

Now , if those rubbers or the sealants , rubbers actually gets solvents then there would be leakage or there in that sealing method .	2.281227636435139

So , you do not want your material rubber material to swell in that particular gasoline or liquid fuels .	2.635011368149946

So , you choose a polymer which would be non soluble polymer in that environment .	3.766695771696904

If you look at the polis polystyrene obviously polystyrene will not soluble in water and methanol , but it polystyrene almost soluble in most of this solvents .	2.7966897866325584

So , it actually gives you idea it doesnot gives you exact sort of solubility behavior , but it this gives you guidelines or help you to understand , what is the solubility you know bring the solubility of the polymer in a solvent .	2.9016981421203547

Now let us move to the next topic where we talk about polymer phase separation behavior of polymer solution .	3.2584882802671498

And again going back to the Flory - Huggins expression Flory - Huggins equation , this is Gibbs energy of mixing .	3.672654717738787

Now , if you want to convert it Gibbs energy mixing per segment or per unit then we will divide by the number of segments total number segments or number of lattice sign n 1 is for the solvent , and this is for the polymer .	3.4550834867091567

So , you divide that and get this as another expression for the poly habrid expression , where this Gibbs free energy of mixing takes place in terms of first segment of the polymer molecule .	3.5614734921440436

Now , this gives the behavior of the or the how the Gibbs energy of mixing per segment varies with , say one of the say compositions in this pie 2 , pie 1 can be converted into pie , pie 2 easily see if you plot say del g mixing .	2.9659423338514506

If you plot del g mixing first segment if you can get from this expression of what we just saw in this case , from this expression we will tell you it will give two general type of variation of this p and g with in this case say pie 2 , of the polymer .	3.3676006394248352

Now , let us consider this case , the temperature is T 5 , now in this case if you take any point say I will take at this point .	4.262043179657339

Now , if this has to spontaneously phase separate to any of the other two compositions , say this composition and this composition two point .	3.294426035363347

So , I consider a solution which corresponds to this particular pie 2 .	4.400810703931406

Pie 2 comes down you can take any two point , now if that process of phase sep spontaneous phase separation happen the delta g mixing of that process would be given by the value of this , which is the distance between the interaction point of the tie line , this is tie line .	3.078401671253801

Now , the tie line is the line straight line connecting two points in that curve and this line , which is a vertical line parallel to the y axis .	2.662464328585408

Now , this the value of this gives you the Gibbs free energy mixing I am telling again the value of this gives you the Gibbs free energy of mixing for the process of separating a composition corresponding to this to , to composition corresponding to this and this now this value , if you can see any of this points is positive .	3.5554039007973945

Which means that this process of spontaneous phase separation is thermodynamically not visible , which also means that each point or each solution in this line corresponds different pie 2 , they are all stable .	2.5858346268759447

That means the polymer and the solvent is soluble across compositions .	4.792882108955542

So , If you take polymer and dissolve in the soluble at in the solvent it will be soluble for that particular temperature in this case T 5 for any at any composition , it will not face separate to any two composition I mean polymer rich and solvent rich , phases as that is thermodynamically not feasible .	3.064760839392727

Now , consider another temperature T 1 you get this type of this is another general type curve .	4.7377146792252445

Now , the region this side below this point say I if I write c and it is a point d below left hand side c and above d is similar to this expression .	3.367525015817264

So , all the composition will be stable , so you will get soluble polymer will get solubilized in the solvent in this range and in this range , exactly like this .	3.6908821438682975

Now , look at another composition here any point here between this and this point any point in this curve , this is the tie line .	3.858151759502228

So , if this has to phase separate this , this solution having polymer mole fraction of this value if that has two phase separate two , two composition having polymer mole fraction correspondence to this and this , the Gibbs mixing would be given by this value and that is negative .	2.936409061169661

So , which means that between this point and this point between this point and this point any composition , which immediately phase separate and come to this two points .	2.9100181470837723

So , if you have any solution having pie 2 value in this region , immediately they will phase separate and form two equilibrium solution , one is polymer rich , one is solvent rich .	2.453661669545355

Now , look at point here any point between this two line this point and this point and this point and this point .	3.109483399146007

So , this is E f so any point between c and e and f and d now , if at if this has to phase separate to any of the slight changes in to slight changes in the composition .	2.650997202685444

Say this point in this point it will be similar to this curve , similarly same in this case , but if this has to phase separate if I consider this point which has this value of pie 2 , if this has to separate phase separate into two phases having composition between this point and this point .	2.9441667960339535

Then obviously delta g mixing positive so that mean unfavourable , but if this composition is phase separate into a point here and here , the delta g be negative .	2.704696943055343

So , it will spontaneously phase separate , see if this any point in this region any composition any solution would be stable , for small change in composition , but it is not stable for a large changes composition beyond this , this point .	2.492986319924671

So , this is region of metastable region where the composition are stable only for slight change in composition .	2.532048095372345

So , this is meta stable region so these regions are metastable c to e and f to d and any composition between e to f is completely unstable , which will immediately phase separate into c and d .	2.2001310176325526

And any composition between this point and c and d to n would be stable , there will be clear solution .	3.9502823330970473

This is the inflection point this is the inflection point .	7.183506531775162

Now , if I change some other temperatures the solution will , you can draw some other lines .	2.8546696418325648

And then join these points , this points to get a bell safe curve which I just come in a minute .	2.9457468293603686

Now , let ’ s talk little more about this two points and this two points c d and e f .	3.27857932085007

Now , delta g mix I can write delta v 1 plus x 1 x 2 the mole fraction delta 1 , 2 delta mu i is mu i minus mu 1 , it can be write little as g is a intrinsic quantity .	2.672148839480212

So , I can write x 2 delta mu 1 plus x 2 delta mu 2 .	3.5129238242021152

So , if you plot delta m versus x 2 you get the slope as delta mu 2 minus delta mu 1 and the intercept will be at x regard to 0 , delta mu 1 and at x 2 is equal to 1 we will get delta mu two till the intercepts , intercept at x 2 is equal to 0 and x 2 is equal to 1 .	2.7274703383466776

And if I want to do it for delta G m star which is for segment and pie 2 , we can easily imagine that the slope would be slope at any point of that curve will be mu 1 .	2.93431592070335

And the intercept at pie 2 0 would be delta mu 1 , which is mu 1 minus mu 0 that is the intercept at pie 2 is equal to 1 of the delta mu to x , this is a simple mathematic you can find out that .	3.3242892324188817

So , what means that if you plot these delta G m versus pie 2 then the slope will be given by this and the intercept would be given by this values .	4.178939057664929

Now , if you look at this two point the tangent for those two point would meet at the same points , which means they have they must have a common tangent .	2.976282502276939

So , these two point must have a common tangent so the and has the slope is given by this , which will also mean that mu 1 for the solvent at point c will be equals to mu 1 at d mu 2 at point c would be equals to mu 2 at d this two point will have same slope and have a common tangent .	2.627910002205904

If the common tangent in the slopes will be same and from the slope , we have already seen you can write that mu 1 c equals to mu d .	3.414644823887337

So , chemical potential of the solvent in this point is same as this point so as the chemical potential of the polymer in this point .	4.778135027084185

And this means that c and d are two equilibrium , equilibrium composition and we name this as binodal , binodal compositions or binodal points .	2.618206159084504

And in the inflection point which is e and f , inflection point e and f would be 0 , these two points which are inflection points is called spinodal points .	2.391814524753347

Spinodal points or spinodal cum composition , basically it is the boundary between spinodal points , spinodal composition this is the boundary between a meta stable and a unstable composition .	3.0436694859144695

The inflection point is the boundary between the mate stable and the unstable compositions and this gives why this expression .	2.746536589081195

Now , I was telling little earlier that now you can draw similar lines like let me try and then join this spinodal points .	2.416694816202167

And also join the you can join this spinodal points and you can also join the inflection points to get something like this .	3.3871230460485005

I have already drawn so you can just see form here , so you can get a curve like this are the locus of the bi nodal points at different temperature , at different temperature you have different bi nodal points you have temperature these , you have temperature these like this at one point they will merge .	2.8323160392594917

And at some points they converge so this point this is critical points is given by critical points is given by convergence of the points of common tangency and inflection points .	2.7098871387705317

Common tangency points are the spinodal points and inflection sorry common tangency points or binodal points and inflection points are spinodal points .	2.692477591084948

So , by converging you get T c , and so you can write at that point at T c both are zero , this way you can get this .	3.660676705298554

I hope you got it this are this line this solid line is this you join different binodal points obtains in different .	2.4777160655806068

So , if one temperature you got binodal points here and here another points you got binodal points here and here , the another one here and here you have just joined them and got a binodal curve .	2.3044037596888707

And this is the point they converge .	6.191984719308663

So , what about this regions then ?	5.8263944561669305

Any composition above this curve this solid curves will be completely soluble they will have single phase .	3.3919326743528355

So , any point in this diagram will be having single , single phase any point with in these .	2.9799927761469918

So , basically this region will be completely insoluble they face separate out .	3.1383995921023295

So , basically you are plotting a different temperature , the composition of the solution so at any point in this region , you get a single phase which is polymer soluble in the solvent .	3.8038023376293166

Any point this is temperature and this composition you get two phase polymer and in this case you get meta stable solution which will be stable to a small fluctuation in the composition , but not in the large fluctuation .	3.4417110504986503

So , this basically gives you the phase you are getting phase diagram of a polymer in a solvent form that original Flory - Huggins equation , this point you call U C S T upper critical solution temperature , so above this temperature the polymer is soluble in that solvent at any composition .	2.7761524228817813

Below this temperature the polymer is the only soluble in that solvent in this composition left hand of this point and in this composition , but above this temperature the polymer is soluble in the solvent at any composition , that is called upper critical solution temperature .	3.182385398406133

And you can get the reverse also and in that case this point called L C S T is called lower critical solution .	3.147917356515148

So , basically below this temperature everything is soluble , in a polymer soluble at every composition so if I take that Flory - Huggins expression this one and Flory - Huggins expression this one… And write the conditions from for spinodal id equal to 0 , you get the spinodal points like 1 1 minus pie 2 plus .	2.7843879862348215

And for the critical this was the critical point you get , again if you do this you have the expression for delta G m and star for if you do this you will get pie 2 c for the critical .	3.8542118497371067

And form these two you can write the critical these are just pure mathematics form you are getting these expression from Flory Huggins expression which we called earlier for the per segment Gibbs free energy per segment .	3.0574118421095124

So , you can get this expression what you will do is just .	4.43348631271297

In the next lecture we will take this and just complete the discussion of our phase separation of polymer solution .	3.839104772488853

And then we will look in to it that how the molecular weight or the size of the polymer determine the solubility of polymer , and which can utilize to fraction fractionate the polymer of different molecular weight .	3.595414589065595

We will just start form this in next lecture .	3.837581489245519

Today we shall discuss about the effect of immobilization on functional properties of the enzyme molecules .	4.978291126313782

We have seen a number of immobilization methods that we have discussed in previous classes .	4.676892364096453

We see that in most cases the enzyme undergoes loss of activity during immobilization .	4.595153675722896

In fact no method can ensure that you can recover the enzyme in hundred percent yield .	3.7021525187293935

The yield can vary depending on the method of immobilization , depending on the carrier and the stability of the enzyme itself with respect to the conditions of immobilization .	4.337301933120484

By real I mean that you cannot recover , after the immobilization , the original enzyme activity by physical interventions .	3.381815956313947

On the other hand the apparent loss refers to the reduced enzyme activity that you are measuring but by certain physical interventions the original activity can be restored .	2.6813850880428367

It is not a permanent loss of activity but due to certain physical forces which make a interplay with the catalytic function , the enzyme activity seems apparently to have been lost .	2.9465208664502063

The reasons for the two types of losses , the real and apparent , could be attributed to one or more of the following four factors that are listed here .	2.7739261648640623

The first and foremost factor is the change in the enzyme conformation itself .	5.32457441868943

When the soluble enzyme is immobilized on to a matrix the interaction between the matrix and the enzyme amino acids might lead to certain conformational changes possibly due to the result of involvement of some of the amino acids residues in the immobilization process .	3.7346697412354466

Very often it has been noticed that a very common feature is that upon immobilization an enzyme may undergo some kind of unfolding ; some kind of a stretching .	3.287297779354457

There are no parameters which can be simply measured .	6.181026716633036

A detailed analysis or detailed study on the conformation , just like what we do as for identification of the globular structure the tertiary structure of the enzyme , one can study .	3.0694497151168223

But other wise a quick quantitative measure of the conformational loss is only through measurement of enzyme activity .	2.899965873930799

For example here you see that this is a typical soluble enzyme shown here .	4.543344391190415

It has been immobilized on to a solid matrix by some bonds ; it could be an electrostatic bond ; it could be a metal salt linkage ; it could be covalent bond or it could also be as an entrapment within a gel .	3.237419642367779

Entrapment within a gel fortunately does not involve the amino acids of the enzyme protein and therefore the chances of any conformational change during gel entrapment are minimum .	3.573923961730062

Then during immobilization , the enzyme may under go some conformational changes .	3.766568095984164

Just a hypothetical change I have shown here .	4.308457504449734

It could be in any shape .	6.231993553375615

It could be simply unfolding ; it could be some kind of stretching and it may lead to a totally inactive enzyme preparation or a reduced activity of an enzyme preparation .	3.4228622608698744

Reduced activity means that the protein content will be reduced .	5.449338851075443

The specific activity of the enzyme that means the enzyme activity in terms of international units per milligram of protein might get reduced .	4.638957964242391

There have been certain exceptions .	5.997449388335953

I am saying exceptions which are rare examples where the enzyme activity after the immobilization has also been analyzed .	3.87266112687035

If the conformational changes are more favorable to the factors that are responsible for reduction in activation energy either by strain or any other mechanism that we discussed earlier by entropic or enthalpic changes which reduce the energy of activation for the enzyme catalyzed reaction , it might also lead to favorable conformational change .	2.9341896178996674

But those examples are indeed rare and not very common examples .	3.8398630563426854

Then the second factor which is responsible for loss of enzyme activity is steric hindrance .	3.8914502803713207

In many cases the immobilization process might involve the reduction in the access of the substrate molecule to the enzyme active site .	3.9247814086520068

You have achieved a good binding but the enzyme active sites are hindered from access to the substrate molecule .	3.328565623041138

A typical case is shown here .	5.537750385915404

In this case , the enzyme has been immobilized on sites which are in very great proximity to the active site and therefore the participation or the involvement of the substrate with the active sites is reduced and that also results in reduced enzyme activity .	3.510522512203509

However such a enzyme activity can be recovered or this phenomena can be reduced if you can use a proper choice of the method for immobilization .	3.643476785256684

In some of the cases the steric hindrances can be minimized by introduction of the spacer arm .	3.6947623028628707

That means between the binding sites introduction of a spacer arm which is usually a hydrocarbon chain and which can make the binding more flexible and there by the steric hindrances can be reduced .	3.1570355068661167

But in a particular method of immobilization the steric hindrance results in a definite loss of enzyme activity which is a real loss and cannot be recovered by physical methods .	3.4003540616707397

For example if you have covalently bound an enzyme i.e. , by covalent bond depending on the method of binding if you have not involved a spacer arm the loss will remain there .	2.9209999852210746

But you cannot recover that .	7.02111288230486

Unless you modify enzyme immobilization procedure whereby a spacer arm is introduced then you can reduce the steric hindrance .	3.2367114588832506

The method can be modified to result in reduced loss as a result of steric hindrance .	3.457308035908338

But once a preparation has been made with a definite amount of steric hindrance , the loss is real .	3.116215234997095

The third factor which contributes to loss of enzyme activity is partitioning effect .	4.073436290309733

We must consider immobilized enzymes in the light of a shift from homogenous catalysis to heterogeneous catalysis .	3.0049279327401024

Instead of looking at the catalytic reaction in a homogenous phase where the catalyst is dissolved in the same medium as the reactant here the catalyst has a different phase - solid phase and the substrate is in the liquid phase .	3.4046348727394884

You lead into a heterogeneous catalysis and the various species that are involved in the reaction , it could be a substrate ; it could be inhibitor ; it could be simple hydrogen ions which contribute to the pH ; they might get partitioned in the two phases depending on the chemical nature of the bulk and the carrier particles and this partition effect can also lead to an apparent loss of enzyme activity in a particular situation .	3.337817747311615

The fourth is the diffusional limitations .	6.130636709583012

A result of incorporation of a solid particle in a reaction mixture and particularly we consider a porous solid particle where most of the enzyme has been immobilized on the interior of the particle .	3.150297673788705

When a solid particle is immersed into a liquid phase there is also bound to be a stationary film of liquid around the particle .	2.8441047491002953

This film thickness can vary depending on the physical properties of the substrate solution ; for example viscosity or density .	3.9142172917445603

They may control the film thickness and these might call also a diffusional constraint particularly with respect to transport of the substrate from the bulk to the site of enzyme catalyzed reaction .	2.833121940072531

The two effects the partitioning effect and the mass transfer of the diffusional effect can be visualized here If you notice here for example in the right hand side diagram we have assumed a hypothetical carrier preparation which is poly anionic in nature .	2.9793017560207677

That means it is highly negatively charged and an enzyme molecule is entrapped or located in the midst of negative charges .	3.072851698877685

The total charge inside the carrier particle or around enzyme where the catalysis is going to take place will be different than in the bulk .	3.67100833088805

If in case the substrate also happens to be a charged molecule , so there will be some partitioning effects of the substrate between the bulk and so the real substrate concentration what we are considering in the bulk phase will not be same at the site of the enzyme reactions .	3.909425514893347

I will come to that .	6.5584590984594495

I am just describing the right hand side one .	5.085652770792932

There could be very clear cut partitioning effects with respect to hydrogen ions because they are positively charged and a poly ionic carrier will definitely have preference for hydrogen ions .	2.6233004377939033

Therefore the hydrogen ion concentration inside the carrier will be greater than the bulk .	4.45236982538126

Similarly if the substrate is also positively charged you are going to have higher substrate concentration in the carrier or at the site of enzyme rather than the bulk or it could be the other way .	4.108655426771576

If suppose the substrate is also negatively charged the reverse might happen .	3.9317345648377264

That means the bulk concentration vary more than at the site of the reaction .	3.5836204496001063

That might lead to the apparent effect on the enzyme activity .	7.112210629895644

On the left hand side I have shown the diffusional effects .	4.173443311138709

In fact a very large percentage , more than ninety percent of the enzyme will be distributed on the porous network within the particle .	3.5868784187301057

Only very small fraction will be on the surface and for the reaction to take place the substrate has to diffuse from the bulk to the site of the enzyme reaction .	4.156873078869389

Here you notice that in the case of the immobilize enzyme unlike a soluble enzyme what we are conventionally used to where the enzyme is in direct proximity with the substrate and can interact and reaction can take place without any resistance other than the chemical reaction , the biochemical reaction .	3.4587234422436204

Here in addition to biochemical reaction you have another limitation .	5.906075150615927

That means the bulk substrate has to diffuse through the stationary film which is on the surface of the particle .	3.603003637768968

This surface , they have a thickness delta on the basis of the physical properties of the substrate molecule and the carrier particle .	4.600322772504113

The thickness of the stationary film can be reduced by changing the flow properties in the reactor stream and as we will see further that the effect of thickness of the stationary film can be reduced if you increase the linear field velocity in a continuous reactor or increase agitation speed in a stirred vessel in a stirred reactor .	3.2252200917822997

So you can reduce it .	7.8502343502801075

But any way it has to transfer from the bulk phase to the stationary phase and their might be some concentration gradient in the substrate .	3.659141665523751

From the surface , the substrate has to move to the enzyme active site and the enzyme is distributed all over the particle .	5.202807741397341

Depending on the particle thickness , let us say diameter of the particle is dp the substrate might be able to reach only up to a part of the carrier .	4.032220767887734

Let us say it reaches up to here .	4.374382203948657

The substrate value comes down to zero .	4.99348003239386

This means that a fraction of the total enzyme available in the immobilize preparation is not able to interact with the substrate because of diffusion limitations .	3.8539267410334417

This will depend on the relative rate of diffusion vis - à - vis , the rate of biochemical catalysis .	4.682021454295909

The slower rate will dominate the effect .	4.609372103692501

If suppose the biochemical reaction rate is very fast compared to rate of diffusion of the substrate into the carrier particle , it might happen that soon after the surface of the catalyst particle the substrate concentration might drop to a very small level or even to zero depending on the rate of diffusion which is smaller than that .	3.852772724596473

So in case of enzyme reactions where enzymes have a very high activity or in other words a few are able to make a preparation which has a very high enzyme loading that means the amount of enzymes in terms of international units per gram of the carrier particle if that can be increased to a significant level , then the system can be operated which is under diffusion limitations .	3.774264284897545

If you are able to prepare an immobilize enzyme preparation with a very high enzyme loading that means the catalytic rate is very high .	3.7096921825007154

Enzyme loading high means the catalytic rate will be very high because the enzyme activity in terms of international units , the reaction rate per unit weight of the carrier , if that is very high compared to the rate of diffusion then the whole system can be conceived to be totally diffusion limited .	4.2125016749180695

The biochemical reaction kinetics will not have a major role to play and the whole thing will be controlled by the physical diffusion .	3.769739733012639

I have told you two kinds of effect of diffusion .	4.381672872085022

One is the external film diffusion .	6.2062565002038275

The other is the diffusional limitations caused by the boundary layer film , inert film on the boundary as external film diffusion .	2.8281500870605245

On the other hand , the diffusional process within the pores of the particle or internal pore diffusion .	2.8258064508514207

The two types of diffusion , we will subsequently see their quantitative analysis in relation to the biochemical reaction but we shall understand that these two processes will put you four additional resistances over and above the biochemical reaction .	2.4504241707376972

Ultimately for all practical purposes our measurements or monitoring will be in the bulk .	4.045702990465644

So the product has to also transport and it might also undergo a kind of a gradient .	3.7748974792212033

Just to illustrate a little more detail on the transport behavior consider a typical spherical particle with an external film shown here .	2.4172759459126545

This is substrate concentration .	9.56923599579231

“a ” is shown as substrate concentration at the bulk phase , that means at the entry of the boundary layer .	3.6564393573805862

There will be a gradient of substrate in the boundary layer .	5.364403013224516

This gradient will depend on the thickness of the boundary layer and you can minimize this by increasing a very high agitation speed in the stirred reactor or increase a very high linear flow velocity in a continuous reactor .	3.3450947429155122

There is a reduction but in the internal porous structure the substrate concentration may undergo also a gradient .	3.547677868330084

This gradient it might so happen that it comes down to zero .	3.4558109616477553

The substrate concentration comes down to zero at this point and therefore all the enzyme present in this phase is not available and apparently it will look as if there is an enzyme activity loss .	3.778817105240097

So the enzyme activity loss as a result of diffusional limitations is a totally apparent loss .	4.485904424756064

If you reduce the particle size to the extent that the rate of diffusion is enough to counter or enough to take the substrate up to the interior of the particle .	2.975249175430262

That means if you can reduce the particle let us say if this particle was only of this much size and this is the center , then it could happen that the enzyme might reach up to the center of the particle .	3.476868890788762

The substrate might reach at the centre of the particle and all the particle is interacting with the substrate .	3.731169923512112

So there is no activity loss and that is what really I meant by the apparent loss of the enzyme activity that means by some physical interventions , by reducing the particle size one can overcome the internal pore diffusion .	3.053380814873969

Similarly by increasing the agitation speed in the stirred vessel one can reduce or totally reduce the thickness of the film and thereby the gradient on the external film diffusion can be minimized .	2.757182255593456

In the part b and c , you notice the combined effect of partitioning and diffusion .	3.1814817834964573

You see here in the bulk phase , the part b shows that in the carrier particle the diffusional limitations are not very high .	4.885755873986716

Although there is a very , very mild concentration gradient , the substrate is present all through the carrier particle .	4.6856141998856025

But the concentration of the substrate in the carrier is higher than the bulk .	7.024318446047137

So there is a partitioning effect .	6.4472369203350315

That means the chemical nature of the carrier has more affinity for the substrate than the bulk .	3.9392200243720645

In the c part the reverse is there .	4.501089958225806

The substrate has lower affinity that means suddenly from this boundary surface the concentration drops and there is a partitioning .	3.137701224417822

So these pictures shows the first one is totally diffusion ; the b and c part indicate the combined effect of diffusion and partitioning .	2.8527643657734476

These are the four major parameters or the factors which cause the various effects on the functional properties of the enzymatic reaction .	3.3199178795913173

Whenever we have to look at any particular feature of an immobilized enzyme reaction , we have to look into these four effects and try to find an answer to the observed behavior .	3.5049097460851817

Let us look at some of them .	6.678287006575007

The first is effect of pH .	6.850484645122478

Very often we look at enzyme catalyzed reaction unknown to have an optimum pH and particularly in the case of immobilization by ionic binding it has been noted that there is an apparent shift in the optimum pH .	3.729731219842682

When you take a soluble enzyme , a native enzyme and determine its optimum pH as against the optimum pH of an immobilized preparation you find that the optimum pH has shifted and this shift is attributed mainly to the partitioning of hydrogen ions between bulk and the carrier particles .	2.990985882386898

That means the partitioning effect of the hydrogen ions between the bulk and the carrier particle depends on the nature of charge .	4.339861819881931

If suppose the carrier is negatively charged , there will be higher concentration of the hydrogen ions compared to the bulk and vice versa and therefore in the case of a negatively charged carrier , the apparent shift in pH will be on the alkaline side .	3.7248395801033105

Because for the higher pH in the bulk the actual pH in the carrier particle will be lower .	4.62941111427648

Hydrogen ion concentration is more in the carrier .	7.295450126133694

So there will be apparent shift in the pH optimum because what we are considering we are not varying the pH in the carrier particle ; we are varying the bulk pH .	3.596083563672267

So at even a higher bulk pH at the enzyme reactive site the pH will be lower and so we will consider it almost like an apparent shift in the optimum pH on the alkaline side and the reverse is true .	3.022673939794539

If suppose you take a polycationic carrier , the shift will be on the acidic side .	3.819428813053486

The second effect of pH is on pH stability ; the same thing , the same partitioning effect .	3.4978702739549927

Particularly in some cases of the enzymes which are known to be more stable under alkaline side or acidic side , an immobilization can lead to increased or decreased stability of the enzyme depending on their behavior , although the pH stability as well as optimum pH in the real sense at the molecular level does not change .	3.095919008500084

The behavior remains the same .	6.93889586532786

It ’ s only an apparent change in the monitoring system because we are measuring in the bulk and therefore the two effects are noted .	3.8800169465398353

If you consider the stability fact of the enzyme with respect to pH certain enzymes are more stable under alkaline conditions .	3.5744928855042923

So the immobilization to an anionic polymer will be able to give you a more stable preparation with respect to pH .	3.940502320127488

I am talking of stability with respect to pH and not thermal .	3.896100528276194

There will be no effect on thermal as a partitioning effect .	4.023822700496584

But there will be some effect on the pH stability because the pH what you are offering to the enzyme particle in the bulk is not the same at the enzyme active site .	4.227868005645191

It is reduced and if it is less stable at the alkaline pH , then even at the higher pH the enzyme particle may show higher pH stability .	3.287543778176219

Right . They are the same .	11.079666086191535

The physical reason which attributes to both the effects is identical .	3.419441302606148

That is partitioning of the hydrogen ions between the bulk and the carrier particle .	3.645821350209586

As an example if you look at some of the optimum pH of the immobilized preparations , which are reported in literature you notice that in most cases here the effects are mostly on ionic binding .	3.9030719055645045

But the pH effects are noted on a minor site in cases of gel entrapment and non - specific binding and particularly crosslinking effects also .	2.584946318354411

But they may be a result of a very complex system which cannot be defined very accurately but ionic binding can be defined very accurately .	3.6282835314926905

In trypsin by binding on to DEAE Sephadex the free enzyme pH which was 8.5 was reduced to 7.0 .	2.878797684671034

Similarly on invertase DEAE cellulose , 5.4 to 3.3 , the immobilized enzyme optimum pH is reduced .	4.093759846661247

Yes . Diethylaminoethylether has lot of amino groups with positively charged matrix and therefore the enzyme activity is reversed .	3.8308558975227744

On the other hand look at an example here on physical absorption on bentonite .	2.598066678002785

Bentonite is clay with high negative charge and this attributes to an increase in the optimum pH .	3.3379067656935497

Some optimum pH changes have also been reported in the case of crosslinking but their effect of change in the optimum pH is a result of some other conformational interactions and not due to partitioning .	3.290832097420012

Particularly the last example of the immobilization of NADH hydrogenase by crosslinking also indicates the shift of the optimum pH but here the optimum pH shift will not be attributed to partitioning effect .	3.269215881566133

It could be due to some of the conformational changes as a result of crosslinking because conformational changes also can bring in some change in the optimum pH .	3.4309319428330705

A quantitative analysis of the partitioning effect can be given in terms of a factor what we can call the partitioning coefficient , the partition factor which is the ratio of concentration of any specie on the enzyme active site divided by the concentration in the bulk If you consider the pH effects or hydrogen ion concentration it can be described in the two phases .	4.213843777608655

That means at the solid phase in the enzyme active site and in the bulk phase by Boltzmann type of distribution where you can give the concentration in the enzyme phase that is in the carrier matrix given by H + E = H + B exp ( - e ?	3.8572189288825482

/ kt ) where E is the electronic charge , ?	4.996618716707758

is the electrostatic potential difference between the two phases , k is the Boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature .	3.0238221708771986

Simplifying this you can get ?	13.593710118081878

pH as equal to ?	11.611740583810727

pH = 0.43e ?	27.902633946715163

/ kt ?	26.5366738081961

is the electrostatic potential difference between the two phases .	4.765408458041286

That means the potential as a result of the charge in the two phases .	4.165399273400929

A is the native enzyme , B is the same enzyme chymotrypsin immobilized on ethylene maleicanhydride copolymer which is polyanionic and the phase shift is towards the alkaline side .	2.801607303744586

H is the hydrogen ion concentration which you can convert into pH .	5.026530585166311

On the left hand side the profile c indicates a pH shift to the acidic side when the enzyme is immobilized on polyorthanine which is a positively charged matrix .	3.045951858746565

I must give you an example of glucose isomerase .	6.866128177151083

Glucose isomerase , some of the native enzymes have a pH optimum of about 7.5 - 8 , alkaline .	4.263061743989866

An alkaline pH for isomerisation of glucose is not a desirable feature because it will undergo a lot of non - specific , non - catalytic , non - enzymatic reactions on glucose isomerisation producing products other than fructose .	2.7095055409743187

A very significant property of apparent change in the enzyme optimum pH has bee used by immobilizing those enzymes to a positively charged matrix .	2.910980762759889

You can use the enzyme in the bulk lower pH although the actual pH of the active site will be same 7.5 or 8 whatever is the optimum pH of the native enzyme .	4.121635065029819

But if the reaction can be carried out at a pH in the bulk which is lower , the side reactions can be totally overcome .	4.952810321427878

So that gives you another major advantage for using an immobilized preparation .	3.9889883603634333

The other effect of this immobilization is on the kinetic parameters .	4.960822549336097

Can kinetic parameters also undergo some apparent change ?	4.238032541783933

Although the kinetic parameters of the enzymes does not change in the real sense but there are apparent changes in the kinetic parameters .	4.336488323989173

First we consider the km , the Michaelis Menten constant .	5.902733860583721

In most cases you will notice , if you look into literature , that the km value undergo a change .	4.046378459404624

The changes can be of various nature .	5.031638443947353

Different methods have yielded increase in km value , decrease in km value and sometimes no change in km also .	3.3324504536299484

The change in km value can be attributed to diffusional limitations as well as partitioning of substrate .	4.27950954082102

Very often wherever the substrate is also a charged molecule similar partitioning effect will take place .	3.857601556191154

There will be a difference in the substrate concentration between the bulk and the enzyme active site as we saw in the substrate profile of the immobilized enzyme particle that in the bulk phase and in the immobilized carrier particle , there will be a substrate gradient and depending on the chemical nature that will undergo and kappm can also be related to km of the native enzyme by kappm = kmez.e. ?	3.628951756955324

/ kt where z is the number of charges .	6.539655421799163

It ’ s an observed change .	5.706374717815266

…… does not change really ; on the on the substrate if we consider the charges on the substrate .	4.818491053538981

The second reason for the apparent change in km would be attributed to diffusional limitations .	3.2942746097020414

The effects due to diffusional limitations on km have been clearly demonstrated by experimental data because if you just use an immobilized enzyme preparation in a reactor and measure km by reducing the particle size you are able to come to a km value which is of the native enzyme which only implies that the diffusional limitations are playing a role .	2.8503544915057497

One of the result reports the km value of the immobilized glucoamylase on different substrates : soluble starch , amylopectin , amylose and maltose ; four different substrates which can be acted upon by glucoamylase or amyloglucosidase .	2.7812834661314043

For the free enzyme the km values are given here on the left hand side .	3.6241230603762222

For the immobilized enzyme you see the km values have significantly increased except on maltose where it has decreased .	3.5007347499216563

This also gives you the feature that the molecular weight of the substrate can also influence the partitioning effect because the maltose being the smallest molecular weight molecule substrate here , it can easily and freely pass through a carrier particle and thereby one can achieve a much higher km value compared to the insoluble one .	3.19039324819343

km in the case of maltose has decreased .	7.021304352719543

It has decreased means higher affinity ; the concentration of the substrate in the enzyme active site is much higher .	4.697333026424945

So it affects particularly high molecular weights substrates and they behave in a reverse way .	3.0832330553511302

This has to be taken care while preparing the immobilized enzyme preparation so that the km value does not increase because otherwise it will lead to a less sufficient catalysis .	3.67821102758958

Another data is on the influence of particle size on the Michaelis constant of immobilized enzyme .	4.058082466913543

If you look at soluble starch as substrate as a function of particle size , particle size being in micro meters the km value increases as the particle size increases .	2.7971440275395394

For example roughly about two fold increase causes 19.3 grams per liter to 31.6 , a very significant increase in km value .	3.154345494206462

Similarly on the external film diffusion also the linear velocity of the immobilized glucoamylase using the 30 % weight by weight 40DE corn syrup , the data here are important in the case of starch syrup because starch syrup when we use for hydrolysis we use a very thick syrup .	2.730314026961748

Even in the case of glucose isomerase when we carry out the industrial reactions , the substrate concentration which is used is about 2.5 - 3 molar glucose which means almost about 45 - 50 % weight by volume .	3.7047572849115604

So it is very thick syrup and at such thick syrup , the boundary film can be very thick .	3.3024347501966314

The film thickness can be very high and external film diffusion in those cases where we use substrates as very thick syrup is usually very high and external film also becomes a major parameter and as shown here if you consider a packed bag reactor with a liner flow velocity from 0.85cm / min to almost as high as 14.5 almost twenty fold increase gives you a km value which decreases from 7.76 to 3.79 almost half the initial value of km .	2.5805702946206623

That means if you are able to overcome external film diffusion the increase in linear velocity means you are reducing the thickness of the boundary film and that ’ s why when we talk of km we are talking only apparent change and not the real change .	3.2810866659282736

The other parameter which is important in the case of kinetic parameter is change in k2 that is the turn over number or in other words you can say if you multiply with the enzyme concentration it becomes Vm¬ .	3.855940167158949

Enzyme k2 change is solely attributed to conformational changes .	3.9144216093391893

That is if the enzyme undergoes a conformational change its specific activity will undergo a change .	3.5656322272311933

In some cases the change has been favorable .	4.715283981777652

There have been reports , although rare not very common , that the enzyme activity increases as a consequence of immobilization .	3.4266174336086586

Another functional parameter is temperature which is important for all catalyzed reactions .	4.2734769302716975

Just like optimum pH , we also need an optimum temperature for a reaction which is known for a native enzyme .	3.770573908417135

In many cases there has been report in the change in the optimum temperature also .	3.823713982733507

The change in the optimum temperature is a result of temperature gradient across the bulk and the enzyme particle and this is very prominent when you talk of gel entrapped enzyme preparation .	4.770216652068079

The gel acts almost like a thermal insulating material and therefore the temperature at this site is relatively much less as compared to the bulk temperature and therefore apparently the apparent optimum temperature will be higher than what is required .	3.1266008357668795

At the active site it is the real optimum temperature but in the bulk it is slightly higher because there is a gradient of temperature between the bulk .	4.927277126808928

Optimum temperature has also been attributed to conformational changes particularly in the case of adsorbed enzyme preparation or covalently coupled preparations where there is no likelihood of any temperature or you can even notice the temperature changes in the case of a non - porous matrix where all the enzyme is just immobilized on the surface of the matrix .	3.250850391643079

There is no porous network and in those cases if there is optimum temperature change it is attributed to conformational change and diffusional effects are also very prominent with respect to temperature effects mainly because the diffusion itself is a process which is very significantly affected by temperature .	3.0006159440907214

In fact the diffusion process is much more sensitive to temperature effects than many of the catalytic reaction rates .	4.470464184517812

The rate of diffusion can be enhanced significantly as a result of increase in temperature and particularly in the case where the system is diffusion controlled the temperature optimum might undergo significant change .	3.5967953157785764

In the case of enzymes which are immobilized by carrier binding methods , for example , either by adsorption or by covalent binding where there are no there are no likelihood of much temperatures gradient in the bulk and the enzyme active site this can be very easily checked .	3.3308475441653713

In case if you consider a non - porous matrix where all the enzyme is supposed to be on the surface there is no porous network .	4.9803858934995695

In those cases the change in the optimum temperature will be attributed to conformational effects only because there is no chance of any diffusional effects .	3.5431547550888256

There is no chance of any temperature gradient .	4.5324917395396

In different cases different kinds of changes in optimum temperature have been noticed .	3.1971339446238

Then the second parameter which is affected by the temperature is the energy of activation .	4.119084654903404

The effect of temperature on reaction rate gives you a parameter activation energy and which is considered also to be a characteristic parameter for any chemical reaction and in the case of activation energy the major reason , the contributing factor is the diffusional limitations that is the rate of diffusion because as I mentioned that the diffusion process itself is highly sensitive to temperature and the activation energy in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation is a net resultant of the two temperature dependent processes the chemical reaction and the diffusion .	3.7458885908254365

So the net effect of the temperature on the overall reaction rate which is a combined parameter between the rate of diffusion and the rate of reaction can be different than the native enzyme because there is no diffusional limitation .	4.17855196389118

There is increase in activation energy there are reports on decrease in activation energy .	3.319832497368701

But one parameter what is understood as storage stability which is attributed to the thermal deactivation of the enzyme with time is always favorable in the case of immobilized enzyme preparation mainly because of the additional intermolecular forces and the intermolecular forces that are involved which keep the process of deactivation to a minimum .	3.1351335197944534

In almost all cases of the immobilized preparation the storage stability has noted to be higher in terms of its half life .	3.951831015467531

So that is almost a proven fact and that is one advantage we have to take of immobilized enzyme for all operational purposes .	3.8625674440213604

Take an example of optimum temperature of various immobilized invertases .	4.81984218045367

As you notice here the native invertase has the optimum temperature of 55ºC and by immobilized preparation by different methods or like physical adsorption on activated carbon is 40ºC , ionic binding to DEAE cellulose is 30ºC which is a very significant change .	2.5848883478615816

As I mentioned some time earlier also that the adsorption process undergoes slight unfolding of the enzyme protein and unfolding of the enzyme protein is an endothermic process which results in reduction in the optimum temperature ; alkylation by covalent binding is 45ºC , entrapment is 50ºC .	2.9980868693680325

Here entrapment is solely as a result of insulation effect , the temperature gradient .	3.8801148196017823

In the case of gradient , but here that means there is some conformational change also occurring .	3.127166372430834

There are some minor conformational changes but not as high as alkylation or ionic binding but there is some conformational change also occurring .	2.6710745350316465

In fact optimum temperature should be higher than entrapment if it is solely by temperature gradient .	3.7314804871468783

No . I am not talking about the stability .	8.004359543885082

I am talking of the initial reaction rate as a function of temperature ; not stability .	4.0923370248159845

Look at the data on the activation energy of various immobilized aminoacylases .	4.843043444249889

I will come to operational stability a little later .	3.925055265020193

Activation energy for the immobilized aminoacylases immobilized by different methods also undergoes a change .	3.888527476263426

As you will notice that in both the types of behavior there is a significant increase on DEAE - cellulose by ionic binding or DEAE - Sephadex slightly less increase but on covalent binding there is decrease in activation energy and these change in the activation energy is a resultant sum total of the diffusional effects and the biochemical reactions and the entrapment in polyacrylamide also results in decrease in the activation energy .	2.854481879834918

Why ? It should decrease .	9.02253155348111

The diffusion will entirely depend on the preparation .	5.281594173945051

There are both kinds of effects because the preparation can be made to be both diffusion limited as well as if the enzyme loading is not very high it can be biochemical reaction limited also and the activation energy measurements will indicate that figure .	3.227340748625442

So it will entirely depend on the loading on the preparation .	4.065553960955521

Here the figures are given under certain experimental conditions in the literature and under which depending on the diffusion limitation or the loading of the enzyme on the carrier will dictate the final activation energy parameter .	2.954533940462001

Finally the most important parameter which we are concerned within the case of immobilized enzyme is their use in continuous reactors or long term reactions whether we can use them in a stirred vessel or in a packed bed or in a ……… reactors or a variety of reactor configuration that are known to us from chemical reaction engineering and we can see that the parameter which is most important to look at the immobilized enzyme preparation property is operational stability that over a period of time when we use it , it should remain stable .	3.5752736605308724

Bacterial contamination is another very often faced problem in the case of enzyme reactor particularly if you are handling say for example a good nutritive substrate .	3.905695948959883

Hydrolysis of proteins or even glucose syrup can undergo bacterial contamination .	3.168453498932409

Then enzyme leakage which depends on the method of immobilization you are following .	3.976495665129506

Finally , degradation of carrier itself .	6.8634082311634454

During use , the whole matrix is under certain hydrodynamic condition and which might cause the degradation of the carrier .	3.1428894115309536

You can get different kinds of profile as far as the operational stability of the immobilized enzyme is concerned .	4.765852263536606

Y - axis is the activity factor , ln E / Eo In the logarithmic scale you must get a first order decay as shown in the first case .	3.159865435741731

These are the four different kinds of operational stability that have been noted and you will notice that they all … .	4.005931940616242

to certain discrepancies in the immobilization procedure .	5.4892628919492665

For example in the case of second profile , this one , there is an initial increase of the enzyme activity and then the normal decay .	4.3931097323995445

Very often such a profile is noted in the case of immobilized cells .	4.709047454826776

In the case of immobilized cells initial autolysis of the cell releases some enzyme and then the enzyme remains entrapped and shows normal first order decay .	2.9446347522617335

But initial autolysis of the cell increases gives some … .	4.00550417383474

activity . In the third one , there are two steps in decay .	5.446513097710034

Initially the stability is very high ; suddenly there is a bacterial contamination action and the decay becomes very fast or some fault in the operation takes place .	2.9340365056806474

Contamination is a very usual problem in continuous reactors and therefore you have a very fast decay .	6.426485352583554

In the case of fourth one initially you have very high decay and then it is continuous .	3.952950023546756

This is some kind of incomplete immobilization .	5.858561849375952

For example if you consider an adsorb preparation some of the enzyme is weakly bound which gets dissolved very fast and then the really adsorbed enzyme preparation shows you a normal decay .	3.2179495499351196

So different kinds of operation activity can be seen .	5.207891027645394

And in case of by the mechanism which you can synthesize polymer you can divide polymer into two classes by step polymerization or by chain growth polymerization .	3.568109025934172

Now , if you remember from the last lecture that in in case of chain growth polymers , the monomers are not started the polymerization reaction by itself , you need to have external agent which will initiate the polymer chain and once the chain starts , monomer can add one after one and thus completing the chain quickly .	3.359806122967092

And in this case we have seen or we have discussed in last lecture that the rate of initiation is typically much lower compared to the rate at which the chain propagates and completes .	4.690962891405648

Now , in case of step growth polymerization , we also talked about that you know you typically have a monomer react with monomer at the beginning gives you a dimer .	4.42028582311238

And then when the dimer is formed it can react with mono gives you trimer or it can react with itself to gives you a tetramer and this trimer can again react with monomer gives you a tetramer and so on .	3.110294443909749

So , in case of step growth polymer or step growth polymerization process the polymers are formed in various stages , no , steps first di , tri , tetra , if you stop reaction , step growth reaction after sometime before completion what will you get in the polymerization medium ?	2.668036486536781

Now , in case of step growth polymerization if you stop in between you will see all these small molecules .	4.081482705134365

These are called oligomers and and a small amount of monomer depending upon at which stage you have stopped the reaction .	2.975880980967851

So , the high molecular of weight polymers in step growth polymers only form at the later stage , at the very late stage of the polymerization process .	3.222788823109263

Now , what do you , what I mean by later stage .	4.470701779123372

Now , first define what is conversion in a polymerization process ?	4.261663946362234

Conversion is fraction of functional groups that are reacted in the process .	5.0862577352002525

Now , it can be expressed as a percentage or it can be expressed as the fraction .	5.043972932438132

So , let us take a example I have say 50 , say 25 .	5.304609464449842

I have 25 A A type monomer one , another 25 B B type monomer .	3.189917254197721

So , what is the total number of functional group here ?	5.717303461197965

Total number of functional group , groups are how much , how many ?	4.205744070309655

So , that is 100 , total number of molecules is 50 .	6.756164006938949

Now , let us , this monomers all react with each other and in the first step you have reaction monomer plus monomer gives you dimer and for simplistics imagination we just thinking that all are monomers and half of the monomers like 25 of this monomer is reacting with 25 monomers and giving a 25 , dimers for our simplistic understanding we are following simply this process , this understanding .	2.6397313916917473

So , functional groups how many now ?	5.245057275031099

25 dimers so each content two , each contains two which means functional groups are 50 .	3.082607021047658

So , conversion is 50 percent and what is the degree of polymerization is 2 , degree of polymerization is the number of structural unit present in the polymer chain or polymer molecule .	5.040760153809868

Let us consider in the second step all these dimers reacted with each other forming tetramer .	3.4790232531573637

How many tetramer would be there ?	5.126315281092541

12.5 on average which means you have 25 .	6.543800106797116

So , if I write the 12 is reacting with 12 dimer 1 is remaining which means that you had 12 tetramers plus 1 dimer left which makes it on average 12.5 tetramers , 12 tetramer plus 1 dimer which resulting at on average is 12.5 dimer .	2.4083278463449753

So , I can write 12.5 12.5 give it 12.5 .	5.455702968005037

So , how many functional group now present in the reaction term ?	4.864993418804885

It is 25 .	23.805431516284106

So , what is the conversion ?	8.111020948990134

75 percent and degree of polymerization is close to 4 .	5.996703911170997

You can calculate degree of polymerization from the number of tetramer and dimers present divided by total number of total molecules present in the system .	3.965272379478168

So , in case of 12 so 12 multiplied by 4 plus 1 dimer 1 plus 2 divided by 12 number of molecules that is 13 .	4.0781978033000845

So , which it gives you close to 4 .	5.977785925532453

So , let us again for simplicity consider these tetramers are reacting with each other forming octamer .	3.0338658426577543

So , I will write say 6 .	6.194133111783107

25 of this reacting with 6.25 gives you octamers .	4.266810195873532

How many ?	26.13236525944179

So , 6.5 on average .	13.362457689635626

So , how many number of functional groups now ?	6.199416029334036

12.5 . So , what is the conversion ?	6.014611650838314

Is 87.5 which is , will give you approximately a degree of polymerization of 8 .	4.433627569065691

Let us take another step where you are taking these octamers reacting with octamers forming this 16 mar which is of , which will come around 125 numbers gives you 6.25 functional group 93.75 conversion percentage and degree of polymers is 16 .	2.691735649264422

So , what I am trying to make you understand , following the simple process where now we just considering the highest in a maximum possible sizes , dimer reacting dimer gives you tetra , tetra reaction with reacting with tetramer gives octa , octa reacting with octamer gives you 16 mar .	1.918685968989586

So , in this case you can see how the degree of polymerization which relates to the size of the polymer chain or polymer molecules varying with conversion .	4.276084623829529

So , even at very low conversion I mean low d p you have a high amount of conversion .	4.319555606470931

So , this emphasize even for example , at say 94 percent conversion you have only 16 d p which is not a polymer yet , it is a still a oligomer .	3.438610807759414

Now , remember this is I am just following the simple reaction these tetramer can react with dimer , monomer and trimer further reducing the chains .	2.9810978217413817

So , finally , this d p will even at this conversional rate actual d p will be lower than this 16 , 8 and 4 or 2 , I am just talking about the one simplistic case where following the simple reaction .	2.9407034590645185

So , this will clearly give you understanding that in case of step growth polymerization you can have the high molecular weight which is the practical polymer , polymers , which is useable polymers can be achieved only when the conversion is quite high , very high more than 98 percent and so .	3.968260130856694

So , if I want to compare between the chain and step growth polymerization , percentage conversion verses molecular weight .	3.8138240461903927

In case of chain polymerization you had situation like this where you can achieve the high molecular weight at the beginning and the time goes or the more or monomer get converted , monomer get reacted you get the amount of high molecular weight polymers more and more with time .	3.838731060662616

And in case of step polymers you get the high molecular weight only at very high conversion .	5.249884238658411

Now , in some cases the chain polymerization can gives you a situation like this where the molecular weight increases linearly with the conversion .	4.742555117949536

It arises situation where the rate of initiation is faster compared to rate of propagation and also the reactions which were responsible for terminating a reactive species , reactive chain were absent in this case .	3.5118203794068177

So , in the first case , in this case which is the normal you know which is , most of the general the chain reaction the initiation is slower compared to the propagation , chain propagation or the formation of polymer chain which means as the chain gets initiated it completes very fast .	4.262835609862986

So , you get high polymer , high molecular weight polymer at the beginning and as time goes more and more chains get initiated .	3.7976705693617796

But , if you have a situation where your initiation is faster compared to the propagation of chain formation rate that means initiation happens quickly at the beginning and as your chain or monomers get added to the reactive chain ends then your polymer chain grows linearly , as you more and more monomers get added to the reactive in chain ends more and more polymer gets added .	2.6704938149103787

So , let us compare between the two polymerization processes one more time in the chain and step polymers .	5.070318770493776

In case of this left side is step polymers and this side is chain polymers .	3.813482800850222

So , if and the reactions are between functional groups .	4.367800316937275

So , reactivities of those functional is not very high and it is it is a equilibrium process , and and during the reaction you have to make sure that your equilibrium goes towards right by taking out the bi product formation from the system .	3.9084090745658693

So , it takes much longer time compared to chain reactions where the reactions happen quickly in a shorter time .	2.7875792735514477

Obviously as the reaction , reactivity of the functional groups are lower you need high reaction temperature to overcome the activation energy , which requires your your reactions to be done at very high temperature .	3.2546676853741094

Now , high temperature reaction is not only to increase the reactivities in or the equilibrium constant of the reaction , but also if you want to remove , if somebody wants to remove the bi product like say water in polyester formation or say example , a water formation water form polyester formation to take out the water you have to increase the temperature high and put a high vacuum so that you can take out the water from the system which will give you the equilibration towards product side towards right hand side which will lead to formation of polymer molecules .	3.095075661121399

And in other case of chain reaction you can do it with lower reaction temperature as well because the reactivity of these monomers are quite high .	3.8019633834668056

In case of step growth polymers you generally get a bi product formation and , but if there are example where this reaction happen without formation of bi product formation and in case of chain polymers there is no bi product formation .	3.3043003307016696

In case of step polymers the monomers as you have seen from the earlier pages that monomers disappears early from the reaction whereas , in case of chain polymers the monomers disappears steadily with time and as monomers disappears you get high molecular chains forming and typically even step growth polymers you have heteroatom in the backbone whereas , in the chain polymers typically are formed by the carbon backbone .	3.1007237727436916

Now , this classification of step and chain growth polymers also is not completely unambiguous .	3.456035757894657

For example if I have a monomer like this , propylene oxide and I make a polymer from this .	3.652681019288117

Now , by from looking at the structure of this molecule or in polymer molecule it is , because it is , has a heteroatom in the backbone with the group it seems like it is a chain growth , step growth polymers , but it is the mechanism of this polymers resembles more of a chain polymers of the type I mentioned in last page , so more close to chain polymerization .	3.3514976264941243

So , this type of ring opening polymers by structure you may confuse with this , with the step growth polymers , but actually from mechanism the way it is synthesized this is more close to a chain polymerization of this type than a step growth polymers where the polymers are formed step wise , dimer , trimer , tetramer and so on .	3.0139043202767004

In this case the formation happens by addition of monomers towards the chain end .	4.014615720751735

More more example of such can be given where this classification is not completely unambiguous .	3.7624214216124643

So , what the conclusion , what the final message you should remember that this addition and chain polymers or chain growth polymers they should not be used interchangeably and so as your condensation and step polymers .	2.663840244375837

So , you should remember that though this addition and chain polymers are quite quite similar in terms of the structure and most of the chain polymers are made by addition reactions and most of the step polymers are synthesized by condensation reaction , but they are different they should not be used interchangeably .	3.686051995733777

Some U , IUPAC has suggested that this should be named as poly condensation in then instead of step polymers or step growth polymerization , but step growth polymers is much more broader nomenclature compared to a term like poly condensation which is which is narrower .	3.1042329626275063

How do you name polymer molecules ?	5.397991950421835

Again like the various classification ways , you know various ways of classifying polymer molecules this nomenclatural so also not very unambiguous .	2.433046350151345

The most easy simple and least ambiguous method of naming polymers is from its source , from source that means if you have a polystyrene , this is styrene .	2.7251153290228523

So , you just prefix this term poly followed by the monomer term and you name this as a polystyrene .	3.6015019690616343

So , acrylo acrylonitrile would give you poly acrylonitrile and so on .	3.444524609974165

So , this is very simple where and this is done mostly from if the polymers are made from a single monomer which monomer is directly converted to the polymer , so styrene to polystyrene and acrylonitrile to poly acrylonitrile .	3.53140590388838

And say ethylene oxide to poly ethylene oxide .	4.450652431600922

Now , if I write this poly ethylene oxide this might give you different structure depending upon how do you represent this molecule .	3.2298977089477066

If I write this like polyethylene oxide put a bracket , it might look like this polyethylene or a cyclic .	3.149107503194051

So , if I write polyethylene oxide that means oxide of polyethylene .	3.1031132119973512

It will look like this , but if I write the same molecule polyethylene oxide then it will mean this .	4.2266502123047225

This is polyethylene oxide which is actually what it is , this is ethylene oxide and you get a polymer from this like this .	3.818314909202355

So , if you have a multi worded monomer , multi worded then you must put a bracket before prefixing the term poly .	2.651684068723512

Some other example we can give .	7.4267223866333065

And if there is the monomer is very complex you know or it has substituted parent name also you have to put bracket before you prefix the polymer poly term .	3.482821875011534

For example , poly methyl methacrylate .	6.022515205356327

A polymer form from 3 methyl 1 pentene because these are substituent ’ s .	3.549205936311741

So , you have to put this monomer term within bracket .	3.858911855392635

So , if I have a monomer like this epsilon caprolactam , I get a , by ring opening polymerization I can get this polymer .	3.272364248517976

Now , this will , how do you name again because this just a polymer of the monomer , so poly caprolactam caprolactam .	3.973553154998593

Now , same monomer can be synthesized from condensation of 6 amino caproic acid , you can get the same polymer which were shown here .	3.5910726045511

The same polymer can be achieved by a ring opening polymers of epsilon caprolactam and a self - condensation of 6 amino caproic acids .	3.030294164149486

So , you can also write this as 6 amino caproic acid .	4.766690793222351

So , the same same structure , same polymers sometimes can be named in a different way you know .	3.2069219994924123

This is vinyl acetate and I put poly term in between , it will give poly vinyl acetate .	3.1394274064855066

So , this polymer is generally formed by hydrolysis of the polyvinyl acetate , but if you look without knowing that that it has synthesized from hydrolysis of these you can imagine or hypothesize that it has been synthesized from this monomer which is vinyl and alcohol .	2.860692709282421

So , this is some cases where this is one of the example of where you name the polymer from a hypothetical monomer .	4.588483806568059

How you typically name these step polymers ?	4.4713353156764715

So , if if this is , if the polymer is forming from by poly condensation or step growth polymers from one monomer then you can simply write prefix poly and put the monomer name after that ’ s , that will gives you name .	3.169480558293881

If it is form from two monomers likes this terephthalic acid plus ethylene glycol you get polyethylene terephthalate .	2.7479665169069167

In this case you indentify in the polymer structure in which class it belongs for example , whether this belongs to a ester class or a carbonate or a amide or urethane .	2.4097863148429823

So , you first identify the polymer , look at the polymer and identify which class it it belongs and then name accordingly from which this polymers is synthesized .	3.0506638257428484

So , when you make a polyester from this two monomer terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol you get a polymer which is polyester .	4.174451899173638

So , you know how esters are named .	4.826645563075652

So , name accordingly .	13.11688813225304

How do you name this then ester form from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol ?	3.0684409315643335

So , you name it ethylene terephthalate and because it is a polymer so you are writing this poly ethylene terephthalate .	3.9832647160976684

So , similarly , you can name other step growth polymers as well where you have to first indentify the functional group or the class in which they belong and then accordingly you name the polymer .	3.483815009605966

So , so a polymer which is found forms abscisic acid and hexamethylenediamine , abscisic acid and diamine acid and amine which will you have to put name as a amide .	2.9174910135224352

So , hexamethylenediamine plus abscisic acid you will call that polymer as a polyhexamethylene abscisic amide , you understand .	2.733493075021014

Now , IUPAC because there is so many confusion or about naming polymers IUPAC has given a guideline how to name polymers .	2.4778242946491313

For that you have to first identify the constitutional repeat unit of the polymers .	5.133277456121208

The repeat unit we talked about that means if you write a polymer structure and the bracket you have put n that means you have to find the the portion thus unit which is repeating .	3.820449113831638

So , if you build a polymer structure which which structure has to be repeated .	3.9830592406350087

You identify the , you already identified the repeating unit and how do how do I name the repeat unit ?	3.0251458904047435

You have to place the repeat unit such a way that the seniority the one , the part which is senior most gets the , you put in the extreme left hand side .	2.784604316584942

You follow the order like heterocyclic ring chains with hetero atom , carbocyclic ring and chains with only carbon .	2.462125132222464

So , if I I have polyethylene oxide .	4.532436326444663

Now , IUPAC suggest that we have , I have indentified this is the repeat unit , constitutional repeat unit in this polymer polyethylene oxide , but according to the seniority you have to write this as this .	3.9803348961439315

So , though we name polyethylene because we know that this polymer has been made from ethylene molecule , but because the constitutional repeat unit is this then according to IUPAC you have to say this as a poly methylene .	3.4097515542087002

Now , in commonly it is known as polyisobutylene , but according to IUPAC it will be poly 1 1 dimethyl ethylene .	3.359160608923307

What about this ?	13.167608875189707

Very common polystyrene , accordingly IUPAC it will be poly 1 phenyl ethylene .	4.312419596161357

So , the PET molecule polyethylene terephthalete we have to write according to the seniority , the constitutional repeat unit like this and IUPAC name accordingly would be poly oxy ethylene oxy , this is tere phthaloyl .	2.4836087629493093

The IUPAC name becomes you know very complicated , very difficult mostly for this step growth polymers .	3.2167718308892166

Whereas , IUPAC would suggest that you name this has poly oxide ethylene oxide terephthaloyl .	2.875831209796473

So , it has become very difficult .	6.283319528481872

So , that is why IUPAC nomenclatures are not very you know used very regularly unless you are making a completed new monomer , new polymer from a new monomer or the the name of the polymers is not conventionally available like polystyrene , if I write tell polystyrene as poly 1 phenyl ethylene you know first time somebody hears the person will not be able to correlate what is , what he is talking about , what I am talking about , but if I say polystyrene it is very easy for the person who is listening , it is easy to comprehend the structure .	2.5098054703400186

So , typically IUPAC nomenclature is not followed in case of polymer nomenclature .	4.32841495478784

Unless you have a new structure from a new monomer then you have to name , there is no common name existing .	4.861976915424455

So , you have to name according to IUPAC or is very complicated name , complicated structure where common names are very difficult like co polymers and and so on , the kind of structures are very difficult commonly then you apply this IUPAC nomenclature procedure and name the polymer .	2.5806948820968953

And also in case of polymer specially in case of this the polymers which are sold in large quantities they have trade names .	4.833272396105739

Trade names width , this is known commonly known in the market and the problem in case of because as I said in earlier classes that in earlier lectures that you , when you use the final a polymer material , you do not use the polymer as such from the synthesis and after it coming out synthesize you add with some other additives and then make compounding and finally , form a product out of that so that the final use of that polymer is not as such 100 percent polymer , there will be some other ingredient has to help and that that plastic or that final use of that polymer , that is no , you said the company so sell this as trade name , where the problem is in trade name that somebody who is know learning polymer chemistry or it is very difficult to remember because same polymer will have different trade names coming from different companies .	2.5211144788828648

A polycarbonate would be called lexan by SABIC , makrolon by Bayer and so on .	2.4856113021786657

So , they flexi glass will be PMMA from one supplier , with some other company .	2.8437264378393476

So , it is very difficult .	6.047326798489242

When somebody who is in the market , who is practicing regularly that person which is practicing polymer scientist or polymer chemist is probably useful for them to you know , necessary for them to remember the trade names as well along with the the common name or the the names which typically used for the polymer molecules .	2.5458676955965176

So , after this nomenclature we will move to one of the important aspect of polymer molecular weight .	3.966936149049019

Now , molecular weight you know is relative term that means is a , the weight of a molecule compared to divided by the weight of isotope C 12 , for sometimes it also more correctly it mentioned as molar mass which is basically the mass of 1 mol of that molecule .	2.9039533300005753

So , you have a unit , molecular weights are unitless whereas , molar mass has a unit gram per mol or kg per mol typically gram per mol .	2.432625986273626

So , in this course we will use this both the terms molecular weight and molar mass and as you you can understand that these are almost same you know , you can as long as you remember what the meaning is you can use this two term molecular weight and molar mass independently .	3.445105280096325

Now , as I said very beginning that when you make a polymer , polymer molecules and polymer samples always comes with a distribution of molecular weight , not all the chains are of same size , there are not of same sizing , not all the polymers are same size , same .	3.549337410170418

So , you always have a something like a distribution big , small , medium like that .	3.2392650029825467

Now , we will only see the mechanism of polymerization .	4.598590270615189

We will probably more appreciate why you cannot have all the polymer chains of same size or same molecular weight .	3.287589716466463

There always has to be a distribution .	8.920627621899623

Now , when you have a distribution to characterize or to represent this sample having different polymer molecules of different sizes you have to mention the average mass , average molar mass , we will say the mixture of several molar mass molecules you have to mention a average and also the distribution .	2.8418642366652778

Then only it will represent the actual sample what in your hand or what you are handling with .	3.629530275812301

So , how do you , the polymer are , polymer molecular weights are defined , a simple arithmetic average by total weight divided the number of molecules which gives this , gives us that number average molecular weight .	3.0882105833981193

Number average molecular weight .	9.278462163366731

Now , again you can write number of average molar mass as well , it is , represent as sometimes like this , some books write like this .	2.9913497157312676

So , you can choose to write any of this and sometimes simply M n , because we know the , as a polymer person or when we using polymers in a sample that always is a average .	3.62893682964617

So , even if you write simply M n it will understand , it will be understood by all of us , we are seeing that it is a average molecular weight , so number average molecular weight .	3.7527395567237147

So , you can mention any of this symbol or you can simply mention M n .	3.918483656732126

So , we will in this we will use M n for most of the time .	5.087727363631122

It is a simple arithmetic mean so M n would be total mass or weight by total number of moles .	3.451860233411602

So , we are talking about molar mass in this case , total weight you have , if you have i number of molecules you can sum with i and you can sum in the vision .	4.095100960842363

N i is the number of molecules , number of molecules in that sample .	5.807435423395206

In the sample having mass of w i .	3.966405166736292

So , total mass will be given by total summation of all the molecules divided by total number of moles , number of molecules in this case , it is a moles .	4.635454915602218

We are talking about moles , number of moles of these things .	5.1620017991383005

So , how do you get total molecular weight ?	4.87510348466014

Total mass of the sample n i is the number of moles having molecular rate of this .	5.605932482235225

So , you multiplied each one n i M i which will give you the weight of or mass of the , that sample and you sum over all the samples and divided by total number of moles gives you the M n 1 , number average molecular weight or you can simply write this as x i M i where this x i is mol fraction of the molecules having molecular rate of M i .	3.2483250739462393

So , M M n number of average molecular rate is nothing but the simple arithmetic , it is the simple arithmetic mean , average of your sample .	3.904330152753102

So , you get total mass n i M i dived by total number of moles which gives you molecular mass , molar mass , mass in the , mass gram per mol .	2.8362889875430626

We defined the second molecular rate which is M w bar or M w or M w which is weight , molecular weight which is defined at , in last case we had this , the mol fraction multiplied by the molecular rate of individual fractions .	3.0142470940169974

In this case we have weight fraction multiplied by the molecular weight of the individual fractions .	4.304067828669852

So , w i is the weight fraction of the molecules having molecular rate of M i .	5.077719786875483

So , I can write individual molecules by total weight .	4.301983193743223

So , weight fraction by total weight of the individual fraction divided by the total weight and individual fraction is given by n i M i .	3.763532214002447

So , you have another M i which will give you n i M i square .	3.9383118853579315

So , you get M w as this .	5.449143835047091

Remember what was M n ?	6.608097972163929

M n was n i M i by n i .	4.488797996276976

Now , in case there is another molecular weight defined M z which is M i cube M i square , this is M z and sometimes viscosity is used as to determine the molecular weight which gives you viscosity average molecular weight M v which is all the expressions are similar , close to each other .	3.0807083990029653

So , this is viscosity average molecular weight .	4.573888815724977

So , the higher is this ratio higher is the poly in dispersive index that means higher is the breadth .	3.607412296379625

So , if you have the polymer sample weight fraction M i like this compared to something like this , this will be , they maybe have similar molecular weight average , but they , this will be much more broader , they will highly will be DI value for this sample will be much higher compared to the value for this sample .	3.2472750439462117

So , typically how this , what is the ranking M z is always higher than M w , then M v and M n .	3.712956409297752

Now , these two are quite close to each other .	4.297062967469333

M v and M w are very close to each other .	5.1061420356313265

So , of this all the four molecular rate we talked about M n is having the least value , M z is the highest and then M w and M w and M v are very close within 10 to 20 percent .	3.202000176842565

M v is always lower than M w , but it is very close within 10 to 20 percent .	4.620798426687281

So , if I plot weight fraction between and the molecular weight or M I , this is molecular weight the curve is , will look like this , this and this will be say M n , M w , M v and this will be M z .	4.085602485080978

And M remember M w by M n is PDI poly dispersive index .	3.5891163672133755

So , in the next lecture I will continue , no why ?	4.700430213720072

What is the necessary for having more than one molecular weights for a given polymer sample ?	3.9216732581699665

Why , cannot we just say M n ?	5.287677576034788

We will try to see whether , now , the necessity of , we can explain with the , why with that , what is the necessity of this define molecular weights .	2.9336413658831777

So , in this lecture what we have learned ?	7.85245599212926

We have learned the classic continuous and classification that that detailed differences between your chain polymers and step polymers and then we studied the nomenclature .	2.779136539547553

And we have studied the molecular weight and we will continue from the molecular weight and move to the step growth polymerization mechanism in next class .	5.099451316766965

Having discussed some of the characteristic features of enzymes in the light of their chemical nature , today we will discuss the functional nature of the enzymes and as most of you are familiar , catalysis is the universal property of enzymes .	3.4529081608487067

The essential characteristic of a catalyst is to accelerate the rate of reaction that it is supposed to catalyze , but in the process it is not used up in itself and in an ideal situation it must be possible to recover the catalyst at the end of the reaction .	3.2614304703384853

As a biocatalyst in the living systems two very significant characteristic properties of enzymes are noted that is the catalytic efficiency .	3.618689039097916

As you will notice , as we go further , that the enzymes provide a much more efficient catalytic system than their chemical counter part .	3.2328416810409983

There are basic intrinsic mechanisms and the confirmation of the chemical nature of enzymes is the responsible factor for providing the catalytic efficiency .	3.0719203744778554

We look into the basic factors that provide the catalytic efficiency .	3.9541434035528504

When I say catalytic efficiency , I normally mean the magnitude by which it is able to increase the rate of reaction compared to an uncatalyzed reaction or the turn over number of the enzyme that means number of moles of substrate converted to product per unit time per mole of the catalyst .	3.2412412677129985

The other feature which is very important is their specificity which is again not attributed to chemical catalyst and the enzymes provide a very specific catalytic system specific to the extent that we can recognize even the isomers they can distinguish .	3.2463153498927917

Therefore it will be interesting to note how they catalyze the reactions such that these properties are built in , in the system .	3.2526525661332237

Another feature which I think must be important to note is that an enzyme like any other chemical catalyst does not influence the thermodynamic status of the reaction .	2.6631582971498378

That means whether it is the free energy change or the equilibrium constant of the reaction , it remains unaltered during the process .	4.886248836456699

It only accelerates the reaction rate by an order of magnitude .	4.787337171684719

Now just as an example if you look at isomerization of glucose to fructose , the reaction can be catalyzed by an alkali say NaOH .	3.4056462585405587

You can get isomerization .	7.9853886847990445

You can also carry out isomerization by enzymatic route using the glucose isomerase .	2.870117609553557

In both the cases the equilibrium constant of the reaction is approximately equal to one .	5.110640424679023

So whether you carry out the reaction by alkali or by the presence of glucose isomerase , the reaction will end up under equilibrium conditions at an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose and that remains unchanged .	3.071113587203262

The only difference , lies by the virtue of the presence of a catalyst or an enzyme in this case , will be that you can reach to the equilibrium status much faster than in the case of an uncatalyzed reaction .	3.876841775240413

Besides the equilibrium conversion or equilibrium constant of the reaction , the catalysis or the enzyme catalysis also follows all thermodynamic concepts that are applied to chemical reactions .	3.0262219873568146

Some times it may look in the case of living systems that certain reactions that are catalyzed are in totality have a positive free energy change .	3.3557754768318424

An example could be cited of conversion of carboxylation of Acetyl coenzyme A to Melonyl coenzyme A .	2.7244987475434255

The enzyme carboxylase catalyses the reaction .	4.972853096510001

The reaction has a free energy change of + 4.5 kilo calories per mole .	3.5237681119944626

The reaction must be non - spontaneous , should not take place as per the normal thermodynamic concepts .	3.4016206710647774

But we all know that this conversion does take place in the living cells .	4.479377891742106

Apparently it may look as if enzyme is doing something which is not allowed by a chemical thermodynamics but in practice it is not so because the reaction is catalyzed in association with another hydrolytic reaction which is energy yielding , which has a much higher negative free energy change and that is hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate .	3.1877714048269055

The free energy change of this is highly negative – 8.9 kilo calories per mole .	4.129010974636969

While the reaction takes place as a coupled reaction of the two systems , the net reaction is a coupled reaction where the acetyl coenzyme carboxylation is coupled to hydrolysis of ATP .	3.1008609559476796

But in practice the reaction does take place in a living cell as shown in the second half .	3.494491913450148

That is the enzyme which uses biotin as a cofactor activates the carbon dioxide at the expense of energy of hydrolysis of ATP and you get activated carbon dioxide with a negative free energy change which is a spontaneous reaction and this activated carbon dioxide then carboxylates the acetyl coenzyme A to melonyl coenzyme A , an enzyme along with the cofactor biotin is released free .	2.639597770996667

The second reaction is also a negative free energy change and therefore it is also carried out and the net reaction is the sum total of the two reactions , what we have shown here .	4.23851812611476

Therefore another feature is that the enzymes often show certain behavior which can be explained on the basis of coupling of more than one enzyme reactions where by we are able to produce certain net results which may look apparently to be non feasible but otherwise they follow all the laws of chemical reaction kinetics as well as thermodynamics .	2.922276980400644

The catalytic behavior of enzymes can be probably best illustrated by chemical reaction rate theory .	3.156745525348004

One of the most accepted theoretical interpretation of chemical catalyzes can be considered from point of view of chemical reaction rate theory which illustrates that molecules can react only if they come in contact with each other .	2.7762384474558655

That means the molecules do undergo certain collisions .	4.113712960215154

Therefore for different molecules of reactants to react collisions must take place .	3.0902343983888416

Any factor or any parameter which increases the frequency of these collisions between the molecules will tend to increase the rate of reaction .	3.3892599671295245

Of the two of the most sort after parameters , one is temperature .	4.60563430294878

We know that if we increase the temperature of a reaction system the frequency of collisions will increase and there by the rate of reaction .	4.1097368785920025

Another is if you increase the reactant concentration again there also the frequency of collisions will increase and therefore rate of reaction will also increase .	3.314903868123003

However while collisions among the molecules might lead to product formation as per this chemical reaction rate theory , it is also understood by virtue of some of the studies on the distribution of molecules which undergo reaction that not all the molecules that collide will result into the product .	2.854530812116637

Only certain molecules which have sufficient energy to undergo reaction will result into the product formation and it will be only a fraction of the total molecules that participate in the collisions process are able to yield the product .	3.6569172360185647

If you consider two molecules in a binary reaction , bimolecular reaction that is A and B and both of them are in their ground state keeping in view all their electronic , vibrational and rotational ground state but possess translational energy which makes them to move for the collisions to take place .	2.389626766558588

If they are to react when they collide the rearrangement of the electronic confirmation in each molecule must take place .	2.4950603607526025

Consider two molecules say for example A and B which are supposed to react in the presence of a catalyst or without a catalyst .	3.668331272383

If the reaction has to take place , then they must start colliding with each other .	3.417595663848641

Initially they will be at a ground state of their electronic , vibrational and rotational ground states but they will posses the translational energy which can make them move and collide .	2.776701948071926

They can only react when the rearrangement of the electronic distribution in each molecule perhaps by transfer of atoms from one molecule to the other takes place .	2.762844033598203

It is clearly pointed out by Eyring in his transition state theory that every chemical reaction proceeds via formation of the unstable intermediate between reactants and the products .	2.2107861613603768

Take the example of hydrolysis of an ester , a very common reaction even occurring in the case of enzymatic reaction .	4.00153724426811

To the ester molecule a water molecule is added .	4.176918963253421

This addition of water molecule results into an unstable transition state compound , which has partial bonds , partial negative and positive charges at the molecule .	2.5073883660357943

This is a stable molecule which has much higher free energy change than the reactants and will break down to give the corresponding acid and the alcohol .	3.3610472253396555

Eyring ’ s transition state theory states that for each reaction to occur it must pass through a transition state which is an unstable state of the molecules or unstable state some where in between the reactants and the products and which has much higher energy than possessed by the reactants of the ground state .	2.70510966227644

This energy requirement is considered as the energy of activation .	4.011882878929697

That means the free energy required for the reactants to reach the level of transition state compound is considered as the energy of activation .	3.4633003910769977

The transition state compound will ultimately break down to give you the product or in other word the energy of activation acts a barrier .	3.8666265317550845

Unless the reactant molecules cross the barrier they cannot get converted to the product .	3.626708804752718

From the energy diagram , consider the first stage which is an uncatalyzed reaction .	4.473694635496651

In the case of this reaction you see the reactants are at a ground state .	4.338018549182238

The X - axis denotes the extent of reaction the Y - axis is the energy content and then the molecules have to undergo an increase in energy till the point where a transition state is reached and then this transition state will break down , will undergo reduction in energy and lead to the products .	3.0939638900530695

These are the reactants and these are the products .	6.964789963197993

The difference between the ground state and the maximum level of energy at which the transition state is generated is called as energy of activation .	3.9501967099189277

That means the transition state will be able to break down and form the products .	5.07278810080427

Rest of the molecules which have much lower energy content will not be able to lead to product formation.On the other hand when we consider the second area where we use a catalyst the main role of a catalyst as we will also further confirm is to reduce this energy of activation by some means .	3.2061443548436053

Whether it is chemical catalysis or enzymatic catalysis the primary function or the primary route by which a catalyst functions is by reduction in this activation energy .	2.3440148101333564

You see that the energy of activation from here is reduced to this level .	3.986130367990837

The number of molecules , the fraction of total number of molecules has increased , which possess sufficient energy for the transition state molecule to break down into product , and large number of molecules can then take part in the reaction and result ultimately into the product .	4.029619837484439

In conclusion by lowering the energy of activation for the reaction , a catalyst makes it possible for substrate molecules with a smaller internal energy to react .	2.9043147524774677

Even at a smaller internal energy level the product formation can take place .	3.8922052524487074

You can see the related concentration of the shaded portion in the two cases without the catalyst and in the presence of catalyst .	4.115066080526067

That will illustrate the point .	8.003565130188278

If we look deeper into the transition state , the formation of transition state can be described as a very easily studied , as an ordinary chemical equilibrium process .	3.0152648702225706

As I mentioned earlier the reactant molecule has to pass through a transition state .	3.300987193911057

The formation of transition state starting from A and B can be considered as a simple chemical equilibrium process .	3.6819795145195613

That means A and B combining to give you an activated complex AB * with an equilibrium constant of Keq or you can put it as say K * .	3.422096290205377

K * = [ AB * ] / [ A ] [ B ] [ AB * ] = K * [ A ] [ B ] ( 1 ) This chemical equilibrium follows the other relationships .	3.0035939110312437

That is the free energy of activation which is required in this whole process can also be given by E * = - RT ln Keq ( 2 ) Rate of reaction between A and B mind that we have not undergone the whole reaction process .	3.647897848382582

We have only come to the transition state complex and the rate of reaction will depend upon the concentration of AB * .	5.106312862361125

The larger this concentration of the transition state complex , the higher will be the rate of reaction and this rate will depend upon the frequency at which the activated complex will decompose and this rate of decomposition will depend upon the vibrational frequency of the bond that is breaking .	3.6939752249031246

From transition state some bonds have to break some has to form .	3.1533354573184935

Ultimately the transition state complex is somewhere intermediate between the reactant and the product .	3.928652438956264

Some bonds are partially formed , they will be completely formed .	4.96309886246745

Some bonds are still in the formation stage and therefore the vibrational frequency of the bond that is breaking will determine the rate of the reaction .	3.557617773412094

This frequency can be arrived at from the theoretical treatment from two routes , by quantum mechanics as well as from classical mechanics .	2.946415247130292

Consider the frequency of energy of excited oscillator by quantum mechanics you get E = h ?	3.464455328711478

and in classical mechanics you get E = kt h is the planck ’ s constant , E is the energy , the ?	3.2151606053162394

is the frequency .	17.512895621848212

Similarly here the k is the Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature .	3.7701728195149027

Therefore ? = kt / h = RT / Nh You are familiar with all these terms .	4.277867748059134

That is R is a gas constant , T is absolute temperature , N is the Avogadro ’ s number and h is the Planck ’ s constant .	2.824092452813288

The frequency at which bonds in a transition state complex will break will be determined by these factors which can be obtained by equating the energy of an oscillator by two treatments .	3.392585751174332

We had as we mentioned earlier the rate of the reaction r r = ?	6.0319336428393635

[ AB * ] ( 3 ) The rate of reaction will depend upon the concentration of the transition state complex and the frequency of the break down of this transition state complex can be written as r = RT / Nh K * [ A ] [ B ] ( 4 ) The expression we got for the concentration of the transition state complex from the chemical equilibrium process .	3.4449703868152866

This term RT / Nh x K * is the second order rate constant .	4.543743856159264

Let us say we define k2 as second order rate constant for the reaction of A and B .	4.382342911318618

It becomes K2 [ A ] [ B ] ( 5 ) or in other words the second order rate constant will be nothing else but k2 = RT / Nh K * ( 6 ) Again you notice a significant fact here that the rate constant is directly linked .	3.395474814456985

All these are constants .	7.850100170333027

Temperature is a constant .	11.331596406452373

If the temperature is constant these are all constants .	6.0854443727724306

So the rate constant is dependent upon the equilibrium constant of the transition state process , the conversion of the A and B into the transition state complex and this also gives you a relationship between the rate constant and the K * , equilibrium constant of the formation of transition state complex .	4.158308072974024

It will imply or it will also be a very logical conclusion that the faster reactions , if the reaction has to go very fast rate , then they must have larger value of K * .	3.3880325458294904

That means at a very fast rate the reactants must go into the transition state or they must have higher concentration of AB * .	3.6044914941748476

This equation will also allow you to calculate the value of K * and hence the value of activation energy during your earlier equation that is your E * E * = - RTlnK * If you use the equation number 6 and 2 you can calculate the value of energy of activation for a given system .	3.757332524468759

You can also conclude that the faster reactions will have a smaller value of E * .	4.052492997463993

No . Energy of activation is not equal to KT .	5.225239821643973

This is the energy of the oscillator , energy term for the oscillator based on the classical mechanics .	3.816732713934426

This is not energy of activation .	5.368478002415345

The second is that the first reaction will have smaller energy of activation .	5.097287607802319

If you combine equations 6 and 2 energy of activation for faster reaction if the k2 is high that means lower energy of activation.These two conclusions do arrive from the theory of reaction rate which is now well accepted world over .	2.9067005479844212

If you look at what we talked about KT = RT / nh x K * ( 6 ) you can also write k2 as k2 = RT / nh x exp ( - E * / RT ) ( 7 ) Now this as all you know we call it as frequency factor which is often written as A .	2.864487192454933

The frequency factor A * you can say because A is the reactant , A * exp ( - E * / RT ) which is a very common expression what we all know as Arrhenius ’ expression .	3.275169436998103

The term E * can again be separated into both enthalpic and entropic contributions E * = ?	2.856582338248491

H * - T ?	17.85118031035053

S * from second law of thermodynamics .	5.457446038434305

That means the energy of activation can also be considered both in terms of entropic contribution as well as enthalpic contributions and if you separate into it then you can write k2 = RT / nh .	4.2571976294433975

exp ( ?	86.27994661459545

S * / R ) .	29.560577232120167

exp ( - ?	86.27994661459545

This conclusion will apply commonly to a chemically catalyzed reaction or an enzymatic catalytic reaction .	3.0295506043021683

If you look at the performance of some of the enzymatic catalyst as compared to chemical catalyst , you will notice that enzymes provide very efficient catalyst .	3.6601179489952194

Simple example where I can compare the reaction which can take place both by chemical catalyst as well as by enzymes is hydrolysis of hydrogen peroxide that is break down of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen , a very common reaction that takes place in living cells by the enzyme catalase .	3.0976819812190737

It can also be carried out by colloidal platinum .	5.8328749405516405

The reaction is also feasible under normal conditions without any catalyst .	3.6106016658713687

That means not a very non spontaneous reaction .	5.053268161102917

It is possible to carry out the reaction .	5.7992179935627615

The corresponding energy of activation for this reaction without any catalyst is 18,000 kcal.mole - 1 as against in the presence of colloidal platinum as catalyst it is 11,700 and for the catalase it is 5500 .	3.078564306345683

This is just an illustrative example but a similar example can be sited from a variety of reactions that can be carried out both by chemical catalysis as well as by enzymatic catalysis and the conclusions are almost same .	2.971868234309363

The enzymes are able to bring down or reduce the energy of activation to a very large extent compared to chemical catalyst and we will again see how this is done .	3.757225562181216

Another interesting reaction in the living systems is on oxidation of methane .	4.517151379119

The methane mono oxygenase enzyme oxidize methane in to ethanol spontaneously in the living cells particularly those organisms which can survive or consume methane as a carbon source .	2.1643056503226408

This is the very first reaction which they carry out when the methane is used as carbon source .	3.140043194580223

This reaction can also be carried out chemically using a chemical catalyst , like zinc catalyst at 400ºc and high pressure , almost few hundred atmospheres , and the turn over number is of the order of 2 x 104 s - 1 , that means number of moles of methane oxidized per second per mole of the catalyst .	2.681167345274809

The same reaction if you carry out at ambient conditions , 25ºc and ambient atmospheric pressures the turn over number is as low as 1.5x10 - 7 , almost negligible .	2.875817298605285

In the presence of enzyme , methane mono oxygenase at 25ºc and obviously at ambient pressure the turn over number is 2.2 x 103 , a much higher value although it is lower than the one which is obtained at 400ºc and few hundred atmospheres .	3.0553434291802906

But compared to ambient conditions and the same catalyst , the catalyst here is zinc and the value is much higher .	3.2576392629534303

Very often a comparison of the first and the third case is not logical because the reaction conditions are different and comparing the turn over number may not be a very reasonable proposition .	3.556679240459713

But if you compare under the same conditions the enzyme as a catalyst will provide you much more efficient system and one should look at how the enzyme provides this kind of efficiency compared to a chemical catalyst because the ultimate goal in both cases is the same , to reduce the energy of activation .	2.7748549190177063

But the enzyme is able to reduce the energy of activation to a large extent as compared to chemical catalyst and also its turn over number is much higher .	3.725437059253393

Let us see what happens when we consider an enzymatic catalysis .	4.554572357227665

Now in the case of enzymatic catalysis we must bear clearly in our mind that one of the characteristic features is that enzymes has a certain ligand binding sites and more specifically substrate binding sites .	2.9583959972474103

That means an enzyme can bind to substrate forming enzyme substrate complex .	4.2653554597594

This enzyme substrate complex then again provides a system which will undergo the energy of activation , undergo the transition state before the product is formed .	3.7019282309640786

Consider an enzyme catalyzed system and an uncatalyzed system .	4.8652316270610765

If you consider let us say E + A + B , same as what we are talking about reaction between A and B .	3.8299559706230197

Consider two routes .	12.796386931161738

One is E , the enzyme does not take part in reaction , an uncatalyzed reaction and it goes to E plus P .	3.24782234067099

In the second case we can also have that enzymes binds the substrate A and B and forms a enzyme substrate complex EAB .	4.025054675469038

It also undergoes a transition state EAB * and then it goes to enzyme and product .	4.772817373930859

Let us consider the rate constants k here ke here .	4.152650150753828

The lower route is catalyzed one , enzyme catalyzed .	3.977850921066632

The upper root is uncatalyzed .	5.901112921356206

That means the enzyme has no role to play here .	4.565534673638447

The enzyme binds to the substrate and then undergoes transition state and then forms the product .	3.9173742686776354

In the middle case from the enzyme and transition state AB you can also form the EAB activated complex .	3.571552622061243

If you consider the equilibrium constant of all these equilibrium reactions let us say this is K * , this is KS , KE * and K * s .	3.3022078547968126

Thermodynamically we can notice that ultimately we are interested in this .	3.9691213531507796

Ke is much , much higher than K , the lower being a catalyzed reaction .	4.030693769924624

Catalyzed reaction will have a much higher reaction rate and so to really get the reaction at a high rate we want a larger concentration of EAB * .	4.1767688212480785

If you look thermodynamically , this product EAB * can be obtained by either of the routes .	3.291185954021859

Either it can go this way and come here or it can also come this way and reach to this side .	3.7891056158999703

From either way under equilibrium conditions , it is possible to arrive at this complex and if you consider the two routes then your KS .	3.7159095689103907

KS * Multiplication of equilibrium constant of these stages should be equal .	4.381498901334925

As I said earlier KE is greater than K and also K = RT / nh .	3.4350643252358304

K * Therefore the KE * &gt ; &gt ; K * and it will imply that KS * , equilibrium constant is much , much greater than KS .	3.4311213700386527

This means that the binding of the enzyme to the AB complex , uncatalyzed AB complex is much , much larger than the KS , the binding of the enzyme to A and B .	4.07147317261793

This implies that the enzyme binds AB * more tightly .	5.519873854782704

The higher value of KS * means the enzyme binds AB * more tightly than the substrate molecules .	3.538802051643802

The general concept that the enzymes have certain substrate binding sites on molecule but conformationally it is more complementary to the substrate transition state and that was the contribution which was stated in very clear terms by Linus Pauling that enzymes are molecules that are complementary in structure to the activated complexes of the reactants they catalyse .	2.498206766303115

The attraction of the enzyme for the activated complex would thus lead to a decrease in its energy and hence decrease the energy of activation for reaction and to an increase in rate of reaction .	3.306214083282355

Stabilization of transition state means that the enzyme because of its confirmation which is complimentary to the transition state , binds and stabilizes the transition state complex .	3.7107253437342558

So at any given equilibrium the concentration of the EAB * that is the product of this binding is much , much higher than as if enzyme does not take part .	4.599438216467007

If suppose this enzyme was not a bio catalyst .	3.9393122935872062

Suppose this E would have been a chemical catalyst this binding would not have been feasible because there would have been no complimentary catalytic function .	2.832069811666883

The catalyst might be able to perform the catalytic function by any other mechanism : by acid base catalysis or covalent catalysis which we will discuss later but the contribution made by stabilizing the transition state of the substrate will not be possible to be provided by the chemical catalyst which enzyme is able to provide and there by it increases the stability of EAB * and thereby reduces the energy of activation and leads to the formation of the product .	3.3782386524592485

That was a major contribution in the understanding of the enzyme functions made by Linus Pauling .	4.098238582754672

For any reaction whether it is unimolecular or bimolecular the substrate or the reactant has to undergo a transition state .	3.2517656817177536

The product cannot be formed without undergoing a transition state .	3.413262119371528

As a matter of fact practically there are hardly any reactions , very few reactions , which are single molecular .	2.8407340781613057

Apparently hydrolysis may be unimolecular reactions but it is not so .	4.9973357417097795

Even in the earlier example we discussed the hydrolysis of esters , it is an addition of water molecule to the ester which leads to transition state .	3.595041153621822

So most of the reactions undergo or involve either cofactor or water molecule , excepting certain isomerases which are truly unimolecular .	2.6014395223180333

But even in that case the molecule has to undergo a transition state otherwise the catalyst reaction is not feasible according to reaction rate theory .	3.696491615263948

Coming back to the role of the energy of activation on the reaction rate constant , if you take arbitrary value of energy of activation , say from 25kcal mol - 1 downwards to 5kcal mol - 1 , a decrease of activation energy results in a very significant increase in the reaction rate .	3.673212574705024

The magnitude at every step of reduction of energy of activation by 5kcal mol - 1 you will see that starting from 3.16 x 10 - 6 at a energy of activation of 5kcal mol - 1 you will go up to 1.33 x 109 .	2.8865827112216866

That means an increase of magnitude by 1015 fold of the rate constant .	3.999956122816563

It is a very , very significant increase in the reaction rate constant and it will give the rate of reaction under any given set of conditions .	5.705013064553709

That means if you maintain same temperature and pressure and substrate concentration increase in the reaction rate constant by a factor of 4.58 x 103 fold can be achieved for every drop of 5kcal mol - 1 which is a very , very large .	3.4769038689906

So therefore even a decrease of the energy of activation by 5kcal mol - 1 can lead to an increase of the reaction rate by a factor of 4.5 x 103 .	3.8918706064488524

Very significant number and in case of most of the enzyme the decrease is of the order of about 15 - 20 kcal mol - 1 in the case of energy of activation .	4.30062885715991

Therefore one can achieve a very high catalytic efficiency in the case of enzymatic catalysis and as you notice that this efficiency is primarily achieved by two distinct factors as we saw today which are unique compared to the chemical catalyst .	3.3436374857068447

One is that enzymes have binding sites for substrate molecule .	3.9331946547683403

The second is the enzyme conformation itself is complementary to the enzyme transition state complex thereby it can stabilize the transition state and increase the concentration of transition state in any given reaction at equilibrium .	4.132750617531307

Now if you look at the whole picture of the enzymatic catalyses again , in the energy diagram we notice the bold lines which go here from the ground state E + A + B uncatalyzed reaction that is the non enzymatic reaction is this one .	2.825215181317515

What happens in the presence of an enzyme molecule ?	7.758210912328556

The enzyme binds to the substrates A and B , forms EAB and this process also undergoes energy of activation .	3.2403290296976266

That means some amount of energy is released by this binding and the enzyme substrate complex instead of starting from the level of ground state of A and B now has reached to a state little higher than ground state by binding process and from there it goes to the bound state .	2.8560891448138928

Even the binding process will undergo the transition state and for this binding process EAB is the product .	4.521721013621622

Then from here EAB has to go to transition state EAB * as I showed in the earlier comparative figure and this EAB * is much , much smaller than the energy level of AB * for uncatalyzed reaction .	2.740177197740182

So you have an advantage .	8.932744178961235

This EAB * is reduced by virtue of the complementary nature of binding of the enzyme molecule to the AB * .	4.4384280732847845

The concentration of EAB * is increased by significant amount and at lower energy level this equilibrium can be achieved .	3.0730432547991002

Two factors which contribute to the reduction in activation energy or the efficiency of the enzymatic catalyst are : one is binding of the substrate and other is complementary of the enzyme molecule to that of the transition state .	3.760683632788302

The same process follows on the reverse of reaction that means EAB * under goes break down into products whereby instead of product directly being formed it forms EP , the enzyme bound to the product , the enzyme product complex and then this EP again breaks down to the next level of your product which is same as of the uncatalyzed reaction .	2.540184969658395

Therefore one is by binding process the enzyme processes started at much high energy level then the ground state as applicable in the case of uncatalyzed reaction and the other is the complementarity of the enzyme conformation to that of the transition state complex .	3.56730394483529

The dotted line here indicates the process .	4.487158468370271

In fact I have shown here only one step just for sake of clarity and removing the congestion whereas this process might undergo more than one humps .	2.4734335408107637

For example binding of E to A , the EA further binds to B in different sequences depending on the nature of catalysis .	2.751826181419685

But there can be more than one processes undergoing here and thereby the binding process can provide you a large fraction of the activated energy to be compensated during binding process and reducing the energy of activation .	2.9812247897281754

In my first presentation I mentioned about the specificity .	3.902291159026446

Coming back to the specificity the presence of ligand binding sites on the enzyme molecule are responsible for specificity .	4.652561686097694

The so called ligand binding sites and when we consider ligand binding site along with the catalytic sites what we consider as active sites on the molecule they constitute for the specificity and we will discuss that in our subsequent lecture .	3.4390013761890588

So today if you recall we have considered in general the basic theoretical considerations behind the catalysis as it applies to any chemical process .	2.8953785184339482

With this we will stop .	11.10008347585643

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In last lecture , we were discussing about polymer properties and their evolution .	3.635397575432357

And we did a detail discussion about mechanical properties , and we also discussed about thermal properties , and little bit of fire resistance properties of polymers .	3.25804390110145

And not in detail just briefly , and then begin our discussion on chemistry of polymer additives .	3.3705191891620014

So , let us start our discussion on optical properties ; now when you make a material out of the polymer , like plastic material .	4.087685626039309

Now the look that sticks of the material , or the parts , depends upon several optical properties .	2.929191285316628

For example , if we are going to make a plastic material or polymer material , which are intend to be a optically clear applications , then the plastic part or the polymer part has to be transparent .	3.475210074732287

And in opaque applications , there are other properties like gloss , reflectance , yellowness index and so many things , surface roughness .	3.021449503011242

So those are the things , one must consider before for a , before you apply or before you have a polymer product out in the market .	3.2256242789778375

So , if we look at these optical properties of a plastic material , you can list a number of terms , transmission , refraction , reflection , scattering , absorption , clarity , haze , gloss , yellowness , index by premium color and so on .	2.5316915685434895

So , what I am going to do is , not to discuss each and every term , but pick up few important term , and then explain and then , see how the value of the particular property , or value of the particular parameter , depends on the chemical structures .	2.8717308694125934

For example , let us talk about transmission first .	5.260409978914081

Now what happens when a light travels through a matter .	3.872668614053005

If you are talking about the plastic material , obviously you are talking about a , you are thinking a plastic material or polymer material , when light travels through the , a polymeric material what happens ?	3.150986230387934

Obviously , first thing happened that it , when it just heat the polymer surface , or the part surface , it can get scattered from the surface of the polymer , if the surface is rough , and of course reflection , part of the light gets back to the original medium by reflection .	3.123678972648555

So , basically when , a light travels through a material , in this case a plastic material or a polymer material .	4.257431806539611

So , basically because of surface scattering and reflection your transmission comes down .	2.850448974282229

In the bulk what happen , bulk they could be two thing happening ; one is scattering can happen , and now because of scattering , there will be loss of intensity of light , and molecular absorption can happen , due to presence of some cromophrous , or some pigment in the material , which could lead to formation of color in the medium .	2.481076419001455

So , because of scattering and absorption , there will be loss of intensity .	4.337309550694374

So , the bulk extension coefficient , is consist of bulk scattering , and molecular absorption .	3.4121724669001527

It may be noted that , this absorbed light can be reemitted , but that reemitted light is always less , or at best equal compared to the amount of absorbed light .	2.7104370695208324

So , there will be a drop in intensity , when light pass through the matter , due to surface scattering reflection , and bulk extension .	2.7334352811474756

Now let us discuss little about this bulk scattering phenomenon , which happens very frequently in a polymer material .	2.9551799314089786

Now the scattering happen , due to in homogeneities in the refractive index in the medium .	3.3980261566635974

So , if there are in homogeneities present , in the polymeric material , there could be , or there will be , bulk scattering ; for example , if you have some particles , so small particles which are , there are voids or some have bubbles are there , then in a homo polymer metrics .	3.2729015410957736

Then there will be a difference in the refractive index , within the media and those portions that just now I mentioned , there will be scattering , took to scattering to happen the two conditions has to meet ; one they should be difference in I RI refractive index between the scatter and the medium .	2.413962513696317

Obviously , if there is a particle present in the medium , whose refractive indices is same as the polymer refractive index , then there will not be any scattering happening .	4.330132885379048

So , first and foremost criteria for scattering to happen , is that there should be a mismatch , or in homogenates in , homogenates in the refractive index , between the scatterer and the medium .	2.7692915008200685

Second ; obviously , the amount of scattering will depend upon , the size and the shape of the scatterer ; the more the size , in comparison to the white plane length of the light being scattered , the higher would be the amount of scattering .	3.853176545550971

For example , phases of crystalline phases , in a semi crystalline material , the amorphous in the crystalline phases will have a different refractive index , so that will cause scattering , and for this reason actually most of the crystalline polymers are opaque in nature , because of the heavy amount of light scattering .	3.1345974522979887

If you have fillers , which are having higher size , compare to , is not very small size , have a significant diameter , then their will scatter light .	2.982205914970867

Immiscible blinds are block copolymers also have difference in , the refractive index between the , two phases form by the two homopolymers , or two blocks , they will also scatter .	3.1178318052112726

A liquid crystalline polymers , because they are different in homogenous in the refractive index , for a liquid polymer crystalline polymer , LCP ’ S .	3.331305551150979

Now for a single component polymer ; say for example , there is a homopolymer we were talking about , or a copolymer immiscible copolymer , they can also scatter slightly , due to presence in special variation of RI , due to presence of some stresses , moldered stresses , or reason vision , there could be some may be very small , but small in homogenates in the refractive indices value , across different places of the material , and therefore that reason there could be slightly , slight amount of refractive index .	2.510427739182035

So , if you want to have , you want to make some polymeric material , which does not , or should not have any scattering , then your material must be very homogenous in respect to the refractive index value , across the inter medium .	3.2455276140360514

And as I said the presence of the impurities like voids , bubbles , etcetera may also cause scattering , obviously the refractive index values between , the material polymeric metrics , and the voids of the bubbles will be different , so depending on the size of these voids of bubbles , they will scatter a light .	2.4443983138455962

Just take a rear example of block copolymer , of BPA polycarbonate and PDMS .	3.436369933130961

This is a structure of the block copolymer , where this block consist of a PDMS block , and a base phenyl polycarbonate block , depending upon , which is higher , this polymer may be a , as elastomeric or thermoplastic if , the amount of rubbery phase that is for PDMS is higher , high siloxane percentage , then this polymer BF block on a BF as elastomeric , and if the amount of siloxane is lower , than this block copolymer behave as thermoplastics .	2.437245346574729

Now let us talk about low concentration of siloxane ; say about 5 to 10 percentage , we are talking about thermoplastics .	3.1357074587999096

Now because these PDMS is stitched with the other block , then they do not face separate in such a way , that they come out or delaminate from the total matrix .	2.8143838236441443

So , they make this PDMS form small domains of PDMS , in the entire matrix , which is mostly BPA polycarbonate , we are talking the composition , where it is mostly BPA polycarbonate , and may be 5 percentage PDMS .	2.652293665171572

Look at the refractive indices of this two , PC is 1.58 , and PDMS is 1.4 , so ; obviously , there is a mismatching in refractive index , so they will scatter a light .	3.1318101319843836

And depending upon the amount of scatter , the transparency will come down , and higher the scattering , the transparency will be low less .	3.8960333256646416

Look at the transmittance T m , or transmission electron micrographs , these black portions are the siloxane domains , and the background is the BPA PC .	2.039103473555202

Now in this case , this a , the block length of PDMS is higher , as a result this domains sizes are higher .	3.2417790960165873

So , it scatters more , and the transparency is transparency is very less , in fact , this is opaque .	2.981145337522841

Whereas when the block length is small , then they also scatter , but the size , because of the size is so small their scattering amount is low , so this block copolymer , the polymer material made out of this block copolymer will look , transparent , but slightly hazy .	2.679132314179964

So , if you look at the optical properties of the polycarbonate , light transmission is more than 88 percent for this 300 thickness pluck , and haze is about one percent whereas , in block copolymers b , where the domains are having smaller sizes , that is all that the scatterer size is very small .	2.449816655047275

There transparency has come down , because of scattering , but not that much , haze has gone up .	3.397126610347593

Whereas when there are scatterer size is much higher , then the polymer is become completely opaque .	4.830892176555334

So , basically what I again telling that , the scattering amount of scattering , depends upon the refractive this mismatch .	3.0453862621980776

If there is , you can make a block copolymer or a two phase system , where the two phases same refractive index , no matter what is the size of the scatterer , it will not scatter , but if there is difference in refractive index , the higher is the size of the scatterer , it will scatter more , and it may turn opaque whereas , if the scatterer size small , it will scatter less .	3.1156655087608907

So , there will be drop in transparency , but it will not , may not be opaque .	4.352593955569401

Now let us talk about , little bit about , the transparency of a polymeric matrices .	3.344197724197399

Now we just learn that , when light falls ; say in a plastic material , or any material , there could be three possible phenomena happen ; one is , the scattering are reflection from surface , second is , the scattering bulk scattering , and the third is your absorption .	2.6894685306812316

So , the total flux , of the light coming in .	4.937287152304874

Let us terribly part of light , which will gets transmitted .	3.2753435231464247

So , this is the flask of the incoming light , and if I consider phi u n , is the flux of light , transmitted and deviated , from its original path .	2.7746757408924774

Then percentage of transparency , is given by the fraction of light , transmitted , and deviated , through the metrics .	3.7380668702271107

Now we can also write , that the light , the flux of the transmitted light , which went out and deviated , would be phi , is the flask of the incoming light minus , the phi d 2 reflection , from surface , minus phi scattering in all direction .	2.1466623855248277

We discussed about , what is the cost for scattering , and phi absorption .	4.583711242729965

If there are some mities or some which absorb light , then it will absorb light , and it will decrease the intensity of the , out flask of the outgoing transmitted light , this might give you color in the medium .	2.7664956139693935

Now , this depend , these two depends on the thickness of your material , and also lambda , the wavelength of the light , which are used .	3.356860479703685

So , obviously , this valued percentage , and hence the percentage transmition , we will also depend upon the thickness , and the lambda of the , or the wavelength of the light used .	3.0705722402354305

Now , if we have no scattering , or no scatter present in the medium , in the polymer material , and also there is no nothing which is absorbing .	4.232456536693933

Then obviously , this transparency is , only given by the loss due to the reflection .	4.1945469236386685

So , theoretically from fractional equation ; the maximum transparence is given by this , where n is the refractive index of the polymeric media .	3.5186747332582313

So , obviously , if we talk about say for example , take a case of PMMA poly methane methylculate , which as RI 1.49 , then percentage T maximum .	3.074320360721947

So , the maximum percentage T of a PMMA , if you put this value here , it will come around 96 percent .	3.7863553563187677

So , this is the maximum transparence you can get , out of a PMMA material .	5.204100570009332

So , higher is the refractive index , lower is the maximum transparency , one can get , when a light pass through a polymeric material , but you one can never get this high amount of transparence through a polymeric material , because there will be some in homogeneity in the refractive index the medium , even this for a homo polymer , and that will cause some amount of loss of flask of , the incoming light or transmitted light , due to scattering .	2.801164721493458

So , maximum transparence for PMMA in real case , we get about 92.8 percents .	3.177204174549257

So , that 3 percent transparence is lost due to , presence of scatterer , and this value is for lambda around 380 diameters to 110 meter ; say lambda changes , beyond that this value , might change .	2.263157732511833

So , what do you learn from here that , less then , if there is no scatterer present , or no nothing is present which is or observing light , in the polymer metric then , the transparences dictated , mainly by the value of the reflect index .	2.889431925956738

So , if you compare , shall I PMMA with a BP PC , which have a reflective index 1.594 , then obviously the maximum transparence possible , for PMMA is higher than a .	2.81121648468855

So , if you want make a transparent , or you want to increase correspondent poly metric material , then you should look for a polymer , which has have lower reflective .	3.225578632052869

Now in this , what is reflective means , it relates to the polarisability of the molecules present , polarisability of the molecules present , and that the order of polarisability depends upon , normally size of the group present , so polarisability of different groups will be of like this .	2.8574892161890326

So , the values of reflective index , if it is right , then say PET , we will have a value of 1.64 , PC equal 1.594 PMMA 1.49 , and say PTFE will have even lower reflective index .	2.956705538496983

So , if the polarisability is less , the refractive index will be also lower .	4.020961970099114

If you want to make a transparent polymer , then ; obviously , for a given thickness , and for given wavelength , it ’ s always preferable to use a polymer , having lower refractive index , then a polymer with having a higher effective index .	2.906811785004944

So , just discuss about the transmission and talk about Haze .	4.594518881975192

Haze is defined as a percentage of the transmission light , which is passing through the specimen , deviates from the incident beam , by forward scattering .	2.9089486841946406

So , obviously if there is something present in the medium polymeric material which is scattering , and it typically scatter in all the direction , then amount of forwards scattering , the amount of lights which is scattered , is , and which deviates from the incident beam , by forward scattering is , what is Haze .	2.735428807108307

Now , for calculating are defining Haze , we will only considered forward scattered light flask , which deviates more than 2.5 degree , on average than the incident light beam .	2.2678974259802676

So , original .	26.244170423645205

So , with the lights , the forward scattered lights , which is scattered beyond 2.5 degree , compare to the incident light , would be taken as the value for Haze , and Haze characterized the loss of contrast , that result when object are viewed through the scattering medium .	2.350118896193427

So , for example if this is a loss of Haze , because of Haze , lose of contrast , so if you are using two plastic material to view this two , then ; obviously , there will loss of contrast .	3.2907724492904085

If you are looking through a Hazy material .	4.457151700787404

Now in that case , that will minimize the surface scattering , because the surface is now smooth , because they are dipped in liquid .	3.531035291438609

So , the Haze is mainly because of the balls scattering .	4.660119096880783

What is clarity , clarity of ability of the sample , to transmit the find details of , the object view through of .	2.670545429868263

It ’ s basically , is a resolution , how good resolution , you can get , when you going through a plastic material , so if the clarity is less , then the material or the resolution will come down .	2.7478333876164363

So , a material if it look at through material , which has lower clarity , then you will low resolution of the object will come down .	2.590152594847749

It is tongue relatives to the angular the distribution of the scattering light , as scattering intensity , and if the size of scatter is large , the angular distribution of scattering intensity will be higher , so it is always prefer to minimize the size of the scattering center , to get maximum value of the clarity .	3.1076050790242475

And obviously , depends on the distance between the object viewed and the sample , and there is , if there is light absorption in scattering visibly , clarity will be lost .	3.2197465725196044

Next terms we be discussion about reflection and gloss ; reflect reflectivity is defined as the ratio of the intensity of reflected light , to the incident light .	2.960389924041242

So , the more amount of incident reflected light .	4.328487146426764

More reflection means the reflective will be higher , and that depends upon angle of incident of the light , and angle of refraction , which in turn depend on the refracting index of the medium .	3.1547878377947076

So , in this case also if you , your refracting index of the material , or polymer is higher then , the reflects reflectivity is also higher .	3.3942721402712936

And if your angle of incident is higher , the reflectivity is higher , and this reflectivity is given by this expression , where alpha is your angle of incident , and beta is your angle of refraction .	2.779144954505202

Gloss relates to the reduction of intensity of lights scatters specularly of the surface .	3.8150527881065903

Specularly means the angle of incident is same as , angle of refraction like a perfect mirror .	3.7869556402943565

If the a surface is not smooth ; say it has rough , then the lights which are getting reflected specularly , from different region , they will have different distance to travel to the observer .	2.499108096305425

So , they will be a phase difference and as a result they will be decreased in the intensity .	5.255513723967273

So , if the sample is half , then the amount of , or intensity of the light , which is specularly reflected will be lower , and there will be reduction in the value of gloss .	4.203360141643689

So , it is better if you want to make a glossy surface , then the surface should be smooth .	3.17451418303123

And also if your , the sample is having a larger refractive index then , as a result of higher reflection value , your gloss will be also higher , how do you measure gloss .	3.123843275420653

Gloss is measured , are related to the intensity .	5.6193430198588965

It basically measured as a ratio of reflectivity of it ’ s , of a sample , to the reflectivity of a standard , and typically the standard is taken as a optically flat black glass , for a particular incident angle .	2.421716318732801

Then the reflectivity compare to this , for a material would be given by , will give the value of gloss .	4.203451919631841

So , gloss will increase with the increasing refractive index , as I discussed that increasing refractive index , the amount of reflective light is higher , so obviously , gloss increases .	2.9962569535716193

Has increases with the angle of incidence , gloss decreases with the roughness ; obviously , the reason that I said that the distance , travel from the surface to the observer , would different from different region , as a result they will phase difference , and intensity will come down .	2.7796499612551138

Other factors like polymer surface , morphology , processing parameter mold finish , which would give us the smoothness of , which basically dictates the smoothness of the molded parts , so they also affect the value of gloss .	2.4313594684487483

For example , blending with rubbers usually leads to decreased gloss values , in case of crystalline polymers like polyolefin .	2.962751221421904

So , you know gla we now discussed , we know the , what is haze clarity reflection , and gloss .	3.162591343802176

One more time we want to discuss in optical properties ; birefringence .	4.199068625450763

Birefringence is basically , optical phenomena , which a sample exhibit different refractive indices , for differently plane - polarized light .	2.396485578549744

So , refractive index value for two perpendicularly polarized light , we will have different value .	3.737684648391221

So , crystalline polymers , they have different refractive index , in particular perpendicular directions , so they will have different values , they will be birefringent .	3.636484217983448

In terms of molecular level , the polariziability in one direction , and the perpendicular direction ; say for example , one very higher aromatic polycarbonate , where they are different , so their molecularly birefringent , but we do not measure the molecular birefringent , we measure the microscophic birefringent for example , and that is given by the difference in the refractive index , in the two different direction .	2.8461251137777626

So , if this not zero , then we consider the sample is birefringence , and for very optically useful material , it is commonly that , the birefringence should be lower .	2.6384430313158176

Just if we talked about the electrical properties of polymers , and we just talked about electrical conductivity , and we know that most polymers are insulating , and so they are dielectric .	3.7837045044958924

And polymeric dielectric used in capacitors , and as a insulators , so basically this are the two main use of polymers , in polymers , in electrical samples .	3.0999876641877346

And the value of electrical conductivity , you have the normal poly polymers ; like polyethylene polystyrene , they have values of electrical conductivity just like insulator .	3.4615233813543194

Whereas , the other end , extreme other end ; the metals the metals which are having much higher conductivity , and they are perfect conductor .	3.2033057986130933

In between there are few polymers , which highly conjugative polymers , they have conductivity in the range of semi conductor , and they are called conducting polymers , and they basically not the commodity , or they are not produced in large amount .	3.147624772974267

They very they produced in small volumes , and we are not going to discuss much about conducting polymers .	3.9062782720772593

The only thing what I want mention , is the examples of few conducting polymers like ; polyanile , ploypyrrole and structures are given here .	2.5679620739377857

Next , we want to discuss little bit in brief , the barrier and permeability of the polymers .	3.6753464915340754

Now think about , that you making packing material out of polymers ; for example , if you taking perfume bottle .	3.252681606525533

Then if you want that , the perfume to be remains in the bottle for as long as possible .	3.3134413609063613

For example , polymer self , heavy used as a packing material for foods , and mainly .	2.9534163448260444

They are so many other applications , and for that it must have some properties , and foods especially , they has to be flexible , they mostly has to be transparent , and they also have a specific barrier properties .	3.12127393353159

So , barriers polymers are having low permeability co efficient , and restricted passages of gases , vapors , and organic liquids .	2.3164759724111263

And if the polymers in barriers applications like , packaging industries , the demand going day by day , for preserving flavor , safety of food products .	2.3263173888454673

The permeability is opposite to the barrier , basically more permeable means less barrier , or more barrier means less permeability .	2.2754947071072738

The permeability is define has the product of , solvability of a gas or vapor , in the polymer matrix , and its diffusion co - efficient .	3.0245243668906965

So , basically permeability is given by , two factor ; the solvability of the gas or vapor in the polymer , and the diffusion co - efficient of the gas in concern , and it is measured , as the permeability is measured , as the rate of transfer of the vapor or the gas per unit area of the material , and per unit measured difference across the flame thickness .	2.9948915380198655

So , basically it is normalized , with the area , as well as the pressure difference across the flame thickness .	3.11217412349282

However , plastics are still not as good as barrier materials like , glass and metals .	3.0126880748683487

So , there is still necessity of making plastics , materials which can be as effective as like glass and metal , for barrier applications .	2.6527216939169223

So , we just said that the barrier , or the permeability properties of polymers depends upon the , diffusivity of the gas concerned , and of course , the solvability of that gas in the particular polymer .	3.0489380134756896

Now the diffusivity of the gas depends upon chemical structures , so it does not .	3.9118873383816575

Only dependent upon the molecular structure , but also in the crystallity and crystal morphology .	3.3577754021099437

In a semi crystalline polymer , crystalline region are highly densed region , and basically it acts as very high barrier , to any diffusion through it .	2.5912692526124186

So , basically higher the crystality , higher is the barrier property for that polymer .	3.8636710747199867

And in fact , if you increase density of the polymer matrix , the barrier properties goes up .	4.564115972607369

So , if the free volume is higher , which means they are the region , the free regions where the gas can diffused through , which means the diffusivity will be higher .	3.2553338990102545

As we discussed the higher the crystality , crystalline regions are inpermeable ; hence lower is the diffusivity .	3.9932322833100087

Higher is tortousity , lower the diffusion .	5.16317823866812

Tortousity means , is the path , one has to travel to cross that thickness .	3.4866731733742062

So , if I consider one example .	5.916181379760508

Now if I have a polymer metrics , and they are .	6.724344729179408

So this is , for example , compare a polymer matrix , just plan polymer matrix , and a polymer matrix , with all this .	3.2445302424900953

These are ; say for example , clays .	8.045004146662533

These are clays , which are exfoliated in the matrix .	4.1414165503051255

Then , if a gas has to pass through this medium , then it has to take longer path , like this , compare to a path where , you do not have this clay materials .	3.12582358960106

So this means this is a tortures path , and higher is this tortures path , the higher is the barrier , to the gas to pass through .	3.280768722673289

And if diffusivity increases , with the decrease in the size of the gas molecules .	5.466102521149489

Obviously , for well known reason , so transmission is follows , for everything is same .	2.7414410937120017

Second parameter , which is responsible for permeability is the solubility , and solubility of a gas in a polymer depend upon , the chemically affinity between gas , and the polymer we are talking about ; that depends upon the solubility parameter of the gas , and the polymer metals , we discussed earlier , when we discussed the polymer solutions , we talked about the solubility parameter .	3.696757592518799

So , basically the higher the solubility , it is higher is the permeability of the polymer matrix towards that gas .	4.709746391645521

We also briefly talk about chemically resistance , chemical resistance is basically a property , where a polymer is being in contact with certain chemicals , and after a given exposure , time the property of the retention is measured .	2.7272202773660186

So , if you talk about mechanical property , then after the exposure , the mechanical property like , impact tension strength , there is a compact or the ductility .	2.8123796894716846

Those are compact with the value which was , before the exposure to the chemicals .	3.1187319706745895

And if there is less detoriation in the values of those property , then the polymer will be resistant to chemical , so this is as simply .	4.217488022990562

You can talk about mechanical properties , or optical properties , like glass Haze , with in contact of the chemicals of the optical properties might change as well .	2.564270083229189

And the resistance of the polymer , to varies chemicals depend on number of criteria ’ s .	4.277991213245471

Obviously , it depends on the chemical structures ; for example , if hydrolysable groups .	5.362343891161264

If you bring contact , if you bring that polymer in contact with acids , or basis , then it will hydrolysis , and as the molecular degradation will happen , the properties will come down .	2.9779137060310963

Similarly it should not react with the chemical you are bringing in contact with .	5.340562082960405

Solubility of the polymers with the experimental chemical ; obviously , to be resistant , the polymer must be soluble , in the experimental chemical , and that depends on the crystallinity and the morphology .	3.3360233800936667

The higher is the crystallinity , normally the resistance to the chemical is higher .	4.332800028558167

So , crystalline polymers are much more chemically resistant then , amorphous polymers .	4.162711000417049

If you are modeled in stress ; like while modeling , because of some other reason , because not good flow in the material you have a , built in some stress .	2.867533232137572

So , modeled in stress is basically bad , for a polymer to be resistant , to a chemical .	4.111005178749513

While testing the several test parameter must be consider , for comparing the chemical resistance , or resistance of different polymer for example , time , of the contact with chemical temperature , at which you are doing the experiment , the stress level .	2.7848510952287437

What is the external stress you are applying during the experiment , concentration of the chemicals which are using , type of exposure , whether you are just contacting , or emerging in that particular chemical .	2.8720468113012187

So , this all parameter has to be standardized , if you want to compare between , the chemical resistances of different polymers for particular chemical .	3.519038750119254

If you want to make bottle , plastic bottle for a perfume , or say something else like , alcohol , then obviously , that plastic material has to be resistant to that of alcohol , to be survived for long time .	2.6329039433374923

So , these are the typical application , where we test for chemical resistance .	3.410069010667326

Chemical resistance ; obviously , chemical exposure may result in physical degradation , stress cracking , craze , swelling , discoloration , so many things can happen .	2.316725944214929

And obviously , it can do chemical attack , and bring down the molecular weight .	4.000968640038512

And if you decrease the molecular weight ; obviously , there will loss of , lot properties including mechanical properties , thermal properties and so on .	3.0642480021825893

Just briefly discussed the weathering of polymer , with lot polymer are used in outdoor applications .	3.5139252209115366

So , for , to understand how long they will survive in that condition , outdoor condition , you must whether ability , or mechanism which a polymer gets weathered .	2.5514776538659087

So whether ability is basically noting , but the retention of property , of a particular polymer after it has gone through , or it has stayed outdoor , whether for some amount of time .	2.7412963751648434

So , the higher whether ability means , it has , it will retain , the polymer retained the properties for a longer period of time , in that given weather condition .	2.845876824022439

What are the condition in weather which affect the polymer properties , is UV radiation in most extend , and that will depend upon , which session you are winter summer , what is the exposure angle , latitude , which latitude you are polymer exposed ; heat cycles , so that will depend upon what temperatures , what is your air temperature and so on .	2.409245332758988

The moisture content in the environment , and that will depend upon rain , condensation , humidity .	4.613198589619319

It is also depend upon acid rain , other polythene .	3.7659427685949427

So all these things contribute to the weathering of the polymers , to different extent ; for example , the UV radiation is the most important parameter for , responsible for weathering of polymer , so they decreasing importance is , this way .	3.014793121826708

So , if you want to compare whether ability of different polymer , you must have a standard conditions , which is very difficult reproduce , and you must compare a conditions , depending upon , or looking at the final application .	3.165124454313272

Basically you cannot say just your polymer is weather able or not .	3.314592797215831

So , you are polymer can be weather able are not depending upon , where it is used , which place , and which condition and so on .	2.9251243533137705

And this are all factors which I listed here , it may not be responsible , you know have different response .	3.086337014957543

So , different polymers response to these factors will be differently , so there is no uniformity condition as I was just mentioning .	3.0390490396780083

So , it will depend upon the final outdoor application , where these polymers are used .	4.4686674930424495

So , what I will do , one I will stop for this lecture , and in the next lecture , I will start the discussion of polymer additives , and some of the additives , which are used to basically protect the polymers from this weather conditions , including see UV radiation , and some additives which might use useful or added to polymer , to increase the perform of the polymer .	3.0731231655486098

In the last lecture we had discussed Michaelis Menten kinetics as applicable to enzyme catalyzed reactions and also the proposed modifications by Briggs and Haldane , whereby he confirmed the formation of enzyme substrate complex and the steady state hypothesis with respect to the formation of ES complex and that the enzyme substrate complex is in steady state soon after the reaction starts .	3.45964364478595

After a very brief induction period the concentration of enzyme substrate complex comes to a steady state .	4.254389424578675

That was initial hypothesis and based on this hypothesis we had also arrived at a rate expression vo = k2 E0 S / Km + S I am just writing here only the capital letters for the concentration terms without putting the parenthesis and km = k - 1 + k2 / k1 ; Vm = k2E0 These two parameters that is Michaelis Menten constant and the maximum reaction velocity can be used to characterize an enzyme .	2.805180335116072

I also pointed out that Vm is not a constant ; it ’ s a function of enzyme concentration and we must take a corresponding kinetic parameter as k2 which is often called as turn over number .	3.134758904243033

One of the most important features of these kinetics which I like to reiterate are the assumptions that are involved in arriving at these rate expressions and I would like you to clearly consider them while applying this kinetics to any experimental situation .	2.402429383306859

As we also mentioned right in the beginning , that any kinetic analysis will involve the match between the hypothesis , the rate expression and the experimental data .	3.0224598142460564

Therefore whenever we look at any experimental data you must ensure that under certain set of conditions the assumptions that are built in , in the Michaelis Menten kinetics are true and they are met .	3.185222905923369

Just to reiterate the assumptions , the major assumption which were made here are formation of E - S complex .	2.7550582407260333

We have assumed that the enzyme has a single substrate binding site and on this the substrate molecule binds and E - S complex is formed .	4.360965301538625

This also limits to a single substrate reaction .	5.06218426285498

The kinetics is basically developed on single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.4865214488260343

It doesn ’ t directly interpret the multi substrate reactions which are so common in the case of biochemical systems .	3.6672670510900014

The third assumption is it talks of initial reaction rate and when I say initial reaction rate the emphasis is that the product concentration is almost zero .	3.8400816990391218

That means we are talking at the rate when there is no product formation .	4.992046877639938

So inhibition by the product or the effect of product concentration on the reaction rate has been negligible .	4.772866942763669

Fourthly we also assumed that the substrate concentration is much , much larger than enzyme concentration which is in most cases a very true assumption and the enzyme concentration being a catalyst is very , very small compared to the reactant as is also the case in most of the catalytic reactions .	3.8182028709380997

The implications of this assumption are the fact that when we monitor the reaction rates we can safely assume that S0 is approximately equal to S .	3.0922436437942946

That means substrate concentration at any given time because not much of product is formed and therefore such an assumption can be held true .	3.2631885412025907

Briggs and Haldane hypothesis was regarding the steady state with reference to E - S complex .	3.779725727191581

But this is a very loaded statement in the sense particularly a deviation from the original Michaelis Menten hypothesis which states of equilibrium of E - S .	3.6313962282914987

Here you must appreciate that when we talk of equilibrium of enzyme substrate complex with enzyme and substrate molecules it means that the break down of enzyme substrate complex into product is a very , very slow process and it does not disturb the equilibrium process of the enzyme substrate binding .	3.983483715256756

That was the original concept of Michaelis Menten .	5.920258977877194

But this was disputed by Briggs and Haldane particularly observing certain reactions which were known to be relatively fast .	2.977225281708247

Then you cannot say that the break down of E - S into product is a very slow step and a reasonable rate of break down will disturb the equilibrium .	3.1044638799709037

Therefore he mentioned that the rate of break down of E - S and rate of formation of E - S are probably the same and E - S remains under steady state .	3.704300134808615

So the rate of change of concentration of E - S is zero and the steady state assumption .	4.620731780418101

That is a very major understanding which we must appreciate .	5.567565978830802

Finally very simplistic assumption is that we always monitor or study or consider these kinetics in terms of constant pH , temperature , ionic strength and all other environmental parameters we try to keep constant .	2.8613874997228836

May be some times water activity and all those parameters are maintained constant .	3.7939401582292134

Any kinetic analysis should be made keeping in view the mechanistic hypothesis , the rate expression and the experimental data .	3.241808523687273

For understanding or for probably analyzing the experimental data for any given enzyme catalyzed reactions we can simply use Michaelis Menten hypothesis directly .	3.732682944883255

But the direct use of Michaelis Menten hypothesis or Michaelis Menten equation has a limitation because it represents a rectangular hyperbola where the maximum reaction velocity is an asymptotic situation and you can never experimentally reach that .	3.0869900202617453

So therefore this simplistic way as we were also talking yesterday was to linearize the Michaelis Menten equation and one of the simplest ways to linearize was double reciprocal plot .	2.7020693203437554

That means you take reciprocals on both the sides of the expression .	3.490487741495574

1 / v0 = 1 / vm + km / vm.1 / S Such an equation which is double reciprocal on both the sides of the Michaelis Menten equation represents a straight line and the experimental data can be easily analyzed based on 1 / s vs 1 / v profile .	3.1453678133894787

The expression will represent a straight line with a slope of km / Vm and intercept on the y - axis as 1 / vm and intercept on x axis as - 1 / km .	3.0680009926924847

This was one of the earliest analyses for the experimental data in the light of Michaelis Menten hypothesis .	4.164334071214382

It was noted to have very serious limitations and the serious limitations are that if you look at any set of data for enzyme catalyzed reaction that means data on the substrate concentration versus reaction velocity you will notice that the experimental data gave very low weightage to the measurements at low substrate concentrations .	3.3251063696245664

Most the data points will be rather concentrated near the origin where as weightage at a low substrate concentration will be very , very low .	3.547683812747355

Under weightage at the low substrate concentrations and at high substrate concentrations near the origin the data points will be heavily concentrated .	3.1498936032536187

If you consider substrate concentration in millimolar quantity and the reaction velocity in some arbitrary units , you see at 5 , 1 / S will be 0.2 , 10 - 0.1 , 15 - 0.66 , 20 - 0.05 , 30 - 0.033 , 40 - .025 and so on .	3.242567748372671

You see that when you increase the substrate concentration the weightage to 1 / S concentration is so low that ultimately you end up in a scattering , a cluster of data near the origin and therefore getting the realistic value of km and vm often tends to be difficult even after making a statistical analysis .	2.6141105564811427

Therefore a number of other linear plots were thought of and the other linear plots are Hanes plot which is nothing else but the modification of original equation .	3.1092103260029895

That means if you multiply the Lineweaver Burk equation simply by substrate concentration on both the sides you arrive at S / v0 = km / vm + S / vm This also represents a straight line and if you see a graphical representation of such a plot of substrate concentration verses S / v0 , you will again end up in a straight line position with a slope of 1 / vm and intercept of km / vm , the intercept on the X - axis as - km .	3.0541761002328163

Here you have little better situations in the sense that the data are usually not so clustered .	3.2601568774502767

They are scattered because you have substrate concentration on both the axis and therefore you get a much better fit .	4.165264030240107

Similar profile an alternative profile is Eadie Hofste plot .	3.55308672534438

Another version of the linear form of Michaelis Menten equation where you can arrive at v0 = vm - km / s.v0 If you plot such an equation and that you can obtain by multiplying the Lineweaver equation by v0.vm on both the sides and then you get a straight line with negative slope where slope is - km .	3.080859343629429

The axis here is v0 / s versus v0 .	4.630228009291748

You get a slope of - km and the intercept on the y axis is vm itself .	3.767331472402186

This also has the advantage of almost well scattered or data points that can be easily used .	3.625438043952661

Now in all the three linear plots which I have discussed that is Lineweaver plot , Eadie Hofste plot as well as the Hanes plot again there is one limitation which has been noticed .	3.3872490703522815

We have no means to look at the adequacy or the effectiveness of our analytical procedure which we have used .	3.5869022037884295

After all the accuracy of our determination or analysis of experimental data will largely depend upon the accuracy of our experimental methods and whatever data point you get we can always make a statistical fit to form a straight line and get the values .	2.7067318277076855

We don ’ t get any insight into the correctness of the data .	3.399250694551392

To take care of that another important plot was proposed in 1974 by Cornish and Bowden .	2.780918123759029

This had the characteristic feature in the sense that if you write the Michaelis Menten equation assuming the substrate concentration and the initial reaction velocity as constants and km and vm as variables although it is little unusual and unrealistic but just for the sake of a mathematical analysis if we write that , we can write for example 1 / v0 = km + S / vm.S If you just take a reciprocal vm / v0 = km + S / S vm = v0 ( 1 + km / s ) We have just written the equation in the form of vm and km as variables .	3.115122178261391

vm and km also represent a straight line with a slope of 1 / s and intercept of v0 .	3.522546342717579

It may look little unorthodox and because km and vm we know are constants .	2.904745161136226

At a constant enzyme concentration vm is also constant .	3.8220973708606945

If we consider a single data point that means at any given point of S1 , we consider v1 .	3.373357797865166

Another set of conditions S2 we consider v2 .	4.555438322534176

For each of these two data points a straight line relationship between km and vm must be valid at least from the mathematical point of view .	3.0959633906535986

So what we do is in this case therefore for each set of data point between S and v we develop a straight line .	3.2995602301851883

We just assumed the hypothetical value of km , corresponding vm is calculated in a table and we draw a straight line with reference to let us say S1V1 .	2.737928486117989

Similar exercise we do for the second data point we also develop another expression , another straight line and this gives you let us say for S2 v2 .	3.2746001063322443

So for each data point we can develop a straight line .	3.8425824929039045

In the enzyme system the reaction will have only one set of km and vm and that will be the one which is obtained by intersection of these straight line relations and that gives you a perfect check on your experimental data .	3.5411809044235807

Very often you notice that in experimental data you may not get a perfect point of intersection .	3.830111397475523

The point may let us say go something like this .	4.634401713778301

Then you are sure in one thing that your km and vm values are somewhere in this range .	3.1259875052524677

You know the range of km and vm values not the absolute value and you also know the limitations of your experimental methods that you are following .	3.2733385299747897

There is some where something flaw because theoretically if all your data points or measurements or substrate concentration or reaction velocity are perfect they must intersect at each other assuming that Michaelis Menten kinetics is valid .	2.2687289315210633

Cornish Bowden plot gives you a possibility not only to get the range of km and vm values but also makes a check on the validity or accuracy of your experimental data and which is probably one of the very basic features in the case of enzyme kinetics that your experimental data must be pretty accurate to be able to analyze the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.091488628814236

Using either of these plots , personally I recommend you Cornish Bowden plot , for any analyses .	2.72935833979023

We must be able to analyze or get the kinetic features or characteristics of any enzyme catalyzed reaction broadly in terms of the value of k2 that is what we call as turn over number and vm and km value .	3.8372563723249105

There is another very interesting feature as far as the Michaelis Menten equation is concerned .	3.9295232733868914

When we mentioned our assumptions of Michaelis Menten equation , you will notice that these assumptions will largely not fit into most of the actual enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.350060745338448

But Michaelis Menten equation is still considered to be the universal model for analyzing the enzyme catalyzed reactions .	3.687649555766065

There is some where some compromise .	5.032165359544567

If you look at each of the points where we have paradoxes in terms of the actual enzyme catalyzed reaction and those which can be done by Michaelis Menten kinetics , the first one that the Michaelis Menten kinetics deals with is the single substrate enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.840249758481006

With the background in the biochemical metabolics you will appreciate that most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions in practice in the living cells are not single substrate reactions .	3.20888851730026

They are multisubtrate .	11.803754479469278

At least two substrate reactions and if not any other directly converting substrate water is a molecule which participates in the reaction .	2.9127046420101705

Now in such cases the applicability of Michaelis Menten equation is still valid under conditions that one of the substrate is held at a constant concentration which is in excess and one substrate which is limiting .	3.734947800835415

The Michaelis Menten kinetics should be applied to a limiting substrate and the other substrate must be in excess and therefore its concentration can be considered to be constant .	4.506288410083612

Even after it is consumed partly the concentration drop is not very large and actually if we look into most of the hydrolytic reactions the water which is almost more than fifteen molar concentration in the reaction mixture , even after participation of water in the hydrolytic reaction , the concentration doesn ’ t drop to significant level and therefore Michaelis Menten kinetics is still valid and gives you on analysis practical results .	2.7367367132365628

The significance of Michaelis Menten equation is that it assumes one substrate binding site per enzyme molecule .	3.830432281758438

When we wrote mechanistic expression for enzyme substrate binding , we are taking one substrate molecule which binds towards enzyme molecule thereby assuming that the enzyme possesses only one substrate binding site which is also not true in many cases .	3.324986269995924

Most of the enzymes , particularly the ones which have quaternary structure for their function , they will have more than one binding site on the enzyme molecule .	3.5191701056527505

But such a fallacy can be taken care in the light of Michaelis Menten kinetics .	3.447747041476643

If the binding sites even if they are more than one , if they are not interactive that means they are independent of each other and do not interfere in binding of each other , then Michaelis Menten kinetics will be valid .	4.246686089860302

The only difference will be that we must take in account multiple binding sites in terms of concentration of enzyme .	4.06812159340272

That means concentration of enzyme will reflect the concentration of active sites .	5.334415697678266

The third is we have talked about the formation of single intermediate complex .	4.9268548733451345

When we say enzyme substrate complex is formed we are talking of only one enzyme substrate complex that is formed .	4.713349881230957

In many cases even which are now practically understood very clearly this is not true .	3.4727068192768398

Very often we end up with kind of interactions as E + S ES ET E + P There are a variety of intermediate complexes that are formed not only one complex .	2.8261721120087633

We just simply consider these the irreversible process .	4.020611984112659

This is k1 , k - 1 , k2 and k3 .	6.050157531685885

You must identify the rate limiting step and put the rate constant k2 that appears in Michaelis Menten kinetics as one which is the rate limiting step and then Michaelis Menten kinetics will apply to it .	3.6408597946737045

Most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions involve more than one intermediate complex .	5.1958218936826865

Now the Michaelis Menten kinetics can still apply to those reactions provided the inter conversion of the complexes is assumed to be the rate limiting step .	3.1104426695313454

Or in other words in place of turn over number k2 that appear in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics you put the rate limiting rate constant in this sequence of interaction in the enzyme substrate or in the enzyme kinetics and that will still be valid .	3.6464520965216187

Related to the same issue of multiple intermediate complexes is turn over number which may involve several individual rate constant .	3.2147852150580345

We often define our turn over number vm = k2 [ E ] 0 and this k2 is defined as the turn over number .	3.56181418237931

In most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions which involve multiple intermediates , a single rate constant may not able to define the turn over number .	3.1903486763969573

Just for example you consider a very practical case which has been studied extensively like ……… catalyzed hydrolysis of esters and amides and if we look at reaction sequence which it follows today E + S ES EAc E + P This is k1 , k - 1 , k2 .	2.9009658340191082

Another product is formed .	10.129421958411589

This is P2 .	10.059133031734437

This is P1 .	10.059133031734437

There are two products formed on hydrolysis , acid as well as alcohol and this is your k3 .	4.540768811748874

If you just analyze this steady state hypothesis with respect EAc which is acylated enzyme complex you get the reaction velocity as v0 = E0.S .	3.271011003885055

k2 k3 / k2 + k3 In fact just assume when we will proceed further we will develop a system by which we can write the expression for more complicated kinetics because when we write for a single enzyme substrate complex developing the steady state rate expression is very simple .	3.188249874846157

As you reach more complexity in terms of more enzyme substrate complexes the mathematical analysis becomes more and more complex and there are routes by which one can write straight away by observation the rate expression and we will discuss that in the subsequence classes .	3.355528126112348

E0.S . k2 k3 / k2 + k3 v0 = { ( k - 1 / k1 ) / k2 + k3 } + S Here in such a case k catalytic in analogy to the original Michaelis Menten hypothesis will be equivalent to Kcat = k2k3 / k2 + k3 Not a simple k2 , the turn over number will depend upon both the parameters k2 as well as k3 and that is another fallacy which is built in the Michaelis Menten kinetics .	3.1983428452529368

It doesn ’ t take care of that .	5.697317945783893

So the Michaelis Menten kinetics need to be extended to develop a rate expression which takes into account steady state with respect to one of the intermediates and analyze it in analogy to develop a lump parameter for defining the turn over number .	2.989015766076827

But turn over number for most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction varies in the order from 10 - 104 per second .	4.190600010795916

So that also dictates that there are certain reactions which are slow there are certain reactions which are very fast .	3.8941221585005055

A reaction with a turn over number of 104per second means so many numbers of molecules of substrate is converted to product per mole of the enzyme which is a very large turn over number as against a turn over number of ten .	3.8624599861154874

The next and very significant advantage of Michaelis Menten kinetics and particularly the significance of the km , Michaelis Menten constant , is very often we get an insight into the functioning of enzymes in the living cell .	3.354130883726973

Take the simplest example of glucose - 1 - phosphate .	5.189968325425872

Glucose is the starting point when we go into the metabolics and its first step is phosporylation of glucose and you get a series of products glucose - 1 - phosphate , glucose - 6 - phosphate or fructose - 1 - phosphate and so on .	2.6337315385638163

These molecules can go further either into the glycogen synthesis as a storage molecule or further to fructose biphosphate .	2.3893030309072993

The route which these molecules will follow will depend on the relative km value of the two enzymes involved .	4.3261346209801355

The km value for the fructose biphosphate forming enzyme is much , much smaller at least thousand folds smaller than the glycogen synthesizing route .	2.967248152125278

Therefore as long as the concentration of these molecules , phosporylated glucose , is not very high it will always tend to go to the fructose biphosphate route and release the energy .	3.8835876717322626

Only when the concentration of this phosporylated glucose becomes quiet high , a part of it , depending upon the ratio of the km value will go to glycogen synthesis .	3.673027668989123

That is one simple example but at many points where the substrate has more than one routes to follow in the biochemical metabolics its preference or the likely physiological route can be decided on the basis of km value and that has been possible based on the understanding of Michaelis Menten kinetics .	2.6766411329006923

One of the analytical advantage is very often we are required to estimate the activity of an enzyme sample .	3.893208498719621

These enzyme sample activity must depend upon the effect of enzyme concentration on the reaction velocity and we use such a parameter particularly when we plot the concentration of enzyme on the reaction velocity .	4.563984486353312

We get a profile .	11.458667971972055

Initially it is a straight line which is linear and then it tapers off towards the end when the enzyme concentration becomes high .	4.450989636276075

Normally we assay the enzyme concentration in the linear range .	5.628002175474214

There are two parameters , two constraints which have to be strictly …. .. when we talk of assay of the enzyme .	3.349719215892459

There are three constraints .	8.116403812977426

The first constraint is the detection of the product .	4.0163686078885785

You must have a method for the detection of the product formed of the reaction .	4.197895744705468

The minimum quantity of product you can detect will dictate the time of the reaction .	3.9921062610943325

The time required for the reaction to be carried out will be considered on the basis of the detection method of the product so that you can accurately determine the product .	4.03793560209564

The second limitation is that you must follow the linear range of enzyme reaction velocity profile .	3.978359104039054

The third parameter is one must ensure the substrate concentration for assay of the enzyme .	4.306648466703882

And for all analytical purposes , the substrate concentration that is taken is much , much larger than enzyme concentration .	3.7071088061987867

For all practical purposes the reaction velocity what we measure is v0 vmax That means the substrate concentration is very , very large and as I mentioned that we can never reach effectively to vm .	3.9638809568153435

We can only approach to vm and for all practical purposes the substrate concentration that is chosen is roughly of order of about greater or equal to hundred km values .	2.70867908856197

So the magnitude of km , the magnitude of Michaelis Menten constant , also gives you a parameter for assay of the enzyme so that you can choose your substrate concentration for carrying out the experiments .	4.7423871070894785

That is another major significance of the Michaelis Menten kinetics .	3.935280419883783

Another important feature of Michaelis Menten kinetics is to define specificity constant .	4.299392710163004

If suppose we have an enzyme acting on more than one substrate .	4.704096721737436

How to define its specificity or compare specificity of the enzyme with respect to different substrates ?	3.9923344983621645

The kinetic parameter available from Michaelis Menten kinetics can give you some insight into this .	3.904455269650385

At a very low substrate concentration , when substrate concentration is much , much smaller than km then your initial reaction velocity will be equal to v0 = k2 E0 S / km A first order kinetics , with k2 E0 / km as a pseudo first order rate constant kf .	3.175143583127669

If you consider E0 as a variable then k2 / km is a constant which is considered as specificity constant .	3.476069622975864

Sometimes some people call it as pseudo second order rate constant considering enzyme also as one of the reactant which is not really a second order rate constant .	3.5448094023104346

k2 / km considered as a specificity constant will determine the relative specificity of an enzyme to different substrate .	4.233798916107362

One can determine these values from the kinetic analysis and one can get the picture of specificity .	4.629301173553805

Under this first order design or under condition of S0 &lt ; &lt ; km there is another feature which we must look at .	3.3057967154203842

At this feature E0 is approximately equal to E , the initial enzyme concentration .	3.466882971487512

We are assuming that the substrate concentration is very low .	6.778874434159391

We can also go to a level that not all the enzyme is saturated ; all the enzyme is not bound , bulk of the enzyme is still available in the free form .	4.746125053005721

Therefore the specificity constant relates initial reaction velocity to the concentration of free enzyme rather than the total enzyme .	4.4574435922169435

So these are some of the practical implications of the significance of Michaelis Menten kinetics which applies to most of the kinetic analysis .	3.7131706680842327

One of the most important features is to test the validity of steady state assumption .	3.168085808560574

We have been always assuming that Briggs and Haldane gave it .	3.3659479920852755

The steady state hypothesis have undergone very severe tests both analytical as well as experimental and it has proved those tests and that ’ s why it has become so much universally valid today .	2.6771805375136117

How to analyze or what are the experimental constraints within which the steady state hypothesis must be considered valid ?	4.086726848088206

That you can very easily arrive at , if you write down the rate expression for rate of change of enzyme substrate complex for example if you look at your original equation that we discussed E + S X E + P If we consider the original equation that we mentioned earlier , we wrote the rate of change of concentration of X .	3.33856558607679

I am again not writing the parenthesis but the capital letters denote the concentration terms .	3.173094736445029

They can be written as k1 , k - 1 , k2 .	7.337119521573498

dx / dt = k1E S – k - 1x - k2x = k1 [ E0 - X ] S – k - 1x – k2x Now you can separate the variables x and t in this equation and ultimately therefore you can write ?	3.035834172634321

dt k1E0 S – ( k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) X If you just solve it you will get a logarithmic term and the solution will be ln [ k1E0S - ( k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) x ] = t + a - ( k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) Let us say alpha is the constant for integration .	3.0572782858263383

This alpha can be easily determined at t = 0and x = 0 .	4.4858249158012

At initial time there will be no enzyme substrate complex and that can give you simply the value of alpha as a = ln ( k1E0S ) / ( - k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) So now you substitute the value of alpha and there by get your final solution to the two integrals and if you take exponential on both the sides and simplify you will come out with an expression v = k2 x and v can be developed and with just two three iterations in between you will arrive at v = k2x = vmS { 1 - exp [ - ( k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) t ] / km + S In this exponential term if we consider that t is very small that means right from the beginning of the reaction the steady state hypothesis is not valid .	2.9521724530934117

If the reaction has to progress to an extent that the t gets a magnitude and the exponential term tend to go towards zero .	2.664805489144759

If the t becomes large now the required size of the t will depend upon the magnitude of ( k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) .	3.872330526540258

The magnitude of this parameter dictates what should be the size of the t .	4.0526741060542895

Or in other words this t is nothing else but the induction phase after which the reaction measurements should be made so that steady state hypothesis is valid .	2.58000229465341

For all practical purposes by rapid mixing techniques people have been able to analyze and determine the value of k - 1 , k1 and k2 a reasonable value .	2.9780430949923544

Particularly if you assume k2 as the turn over number and we mentioned that the value ranges from 10 - 104 .	3.773704249847936

A reasonable magnitude of this will be let us say about thousand per second and even at this thousand per second the exponential of course at time equal to let us say five minutes or three hundred seconds the magnitude of this exponential will be less than .01 .	2.9129909302925907

A very , very small quantity and then the rate expression will turn up into the Michaelis Menten kinetics .	4.746328937363818

This magnitude will depend on two factors one is turn over number and as we already know that turn over number of these reactions is pretty high , orders of magnitude of few thousand .	2.925861509376816

If you take a reasonable time then the multiplication of turn over number or rather not exactly turn over number but sum total of ( k1S + k - 1 + k2 ) , out of which only one factor is turn over number , that magnitude if it becomes large enough so that the exponential of it ’ s negative is approaching zero , our system will turn up into a Michaelis Menten expression .	2.448782418573221

So the constraints for the applicability of Michaelis Menten hypothesis particularly steady state hypothesis will be valid in case when we take a reasonable time period and also the turn over number is high .	3.109377016682646

In most of the practical cases where the reactions have been studied the two parameters have been found to be valid and that gives validity to the steady state hypothesis for all practical purposes .	3.2836100598149405

Also in many of the critical situations where the assumptions of the enzyme catalyzed reactions were not valid strictly under certain set of condition the Michaelis Menten kinetics could be considered to be applicable .	3.27648694241924

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In the last lecture we were discussing about gel permeation chromatography , and then about mass spectroscopy for determining polymer molecular weights .	2.9407101985405903

And with that we came to end of the discussion of how to determine polymer molecular weight .	4.390488213593897

Today we will move to a different topic , which is Structural Analysis of Polymers by Spectroscopic Method .	2.8965494682096784

Now , we have in the beginning of this lecture series , we knew or we found out how to synthesize polymers by different process .	2.9839889507896364

And then and next set of lectures we found how to characterize the polymers in solution , including the how to determine the molecular weight of the polymers .	3.3719614376958336

Now , we will know whether the polymer , what is the polymers we have made , so in this chemical structure analysis we will be basically discussing , mainly this spectroscopic techniques , by which we will be analyzing the chemical structures including the microstructures of polymer molecules .	3.4911165825091066

And out of this listed spectroscopic method , we will mainly discuss the NMR techniques to use up the NMR techniques mainly and we will briefly mention about UV visible , and IR spectroscopy , and we have discussed mass spectroscopy in the last class .	2.770242651103975

So , it is very critical when we make that , we now we know how to make this polymers , and what is the molecular weight of the polymers we made .	4.316147546396862

Now , obviously we need to know whether , we have made the right polymer , you know we may be have something particular in mind , in terms of chemical structures , in terms of end groups of the polymer and if you are making copolymer .	4.037537018302882

Then the microstructures of copolymers , the composition , the series , the sequence of the monomers by which the copolymer is made , so the all these are important .	3.5304731206560622

So , we must know before going to further , to do know the property or to determine the property of these polymers which we made , you must know what is actually the chemical structure of the polymers .	3.603517294704761

So , it is very important crucial to know you know the repeat units , we may have used a particular monomer , whether that monomer exist in the same form as repeat unit we need to find out ; what is the end group of that polymer , what is the molecular microstructure in terms of homopolymer ?	3.6646032846358088

For example , the tacticity whether it is seen that syndiotactic , atactic or isotactic , and then chemically compositions of the of a copolymer , the mole fraction of the repeat unit , the sequence of the different repeat units in a copolymer .	3.0796334847774673

And spectroscopy is a most powerful method , which we can utilize to get this structure analysis done .	3.8369875503046815

Now , what will do with in this lecture , we briefly talk about the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation , the basis of spectroscopy , interaction of electromagnetic radiation with maters in this case polymers .	3.599056952348031

This is you all of us know , the electromagnetic radiation , and this is the increasing wavelength , so this is left hand side is increasing frequency , which makes this increasing energy , and this is a short wavelength it can penetrate atom , so we can study extra refraction using x - rays here .	2.9687441364234473

Next is a little higher wavelength or little less energy is the UV visible , UV visible spectrum , where we mainly mainly mainly prove the electronic transitions of a molecules .	2.4038486416045766

And then using IR , impetrate spectra we can prove the molecular vibration and finally , with radio frequency radiation , we can use this radio frequency in NMR technique to know the chemical structure of the polymer molecules .	2.7188171897377003

So , basically matter can interact two three ways , with the radiation it can absorb , and intensity when it absorb , intensity can change from I 0 to o I , so you can plot transmission or the absorbance versus wavelength , and to find out we at which wavelength it is absorbing maximum , and what is criteria and so on .	2.208734586952193

emission spectra light it when we sign a light in a sample , it can absorb and then it can emit emit , may be in the same wavelength or different wavelength , and with the help of detector we can get a get the intensity of this emitted radiation .	3.008116976049553

And the different type of emission spectra we can use fluorescence , emission from excited electronic single states , phosphorescence , emissions from excited electronic triplet states .	2.5897073331608786

The other type of interaction is scattering , and optical rotation , the sample might change the rotational rotation or polarization of the sample causing change in optical rotation of the light .	2.5897115977279994

Now , come to UV - visible spectroscopy or just talk about in this course , we are not going into details about this spectroscopic techniques , because these are very basic techniques ; what I will just mention basic few basic like points , and then tell you what is the application of this particular spectroscopy in terms of polymer characterization .	3.2118187375783696

So , in terms UV - visible , basics of UV - visible spectra , it is basically electronic transitions from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , homo and LUMO .	2.345965636431759

Then nonbonding electrons , molecular orbital sometimes if the nonbonding molecular weight are the highest orbitals , occupied then the electronic transition may happen from nonbonding molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital .	2.0645587663948084

So , for molecules which have only sigma orbital , mainly sigma orbital , then homo LUMO transition happens between sigma and sigma star , which is of quite high energy and not having very practical interest .	2.2549784360589036

If there is a pi bond in the compound or a molecule and specially , if the pi bond there are many pi bonds which are pi orbitals or pi bonds which are conjugated , then the pi pi transitions , transitions are of like UV - visible range , and the mole conjugation , mole it goes to visible range , and higher wavelength .	2.290999020350376

And this is having great practical significance which helps us to find out the group , functional groups or the conjugation present in the molecule .	3.402490609096842

So , how this UV spectroscopy is applied in polymer science , in characterization of polymers basically , it is like the how the UV spectroscopy is applied to in for the small molecules for example , it helps in detection of particular homophobes , which been light absorbing group present in a molecules .	2.598077661326936

And obviously , here that the UV visible absorption spectra for the monomers , and for the peaks of the monomers and the polymers will be different , so we can follow the monomer peaks , and to find out the conversion during the polymerization .	4.009545017154139

If one the , in the copolymer , if one of the polymers you know the two monomers they have a different UV spectra , UV - visible spectra , then we can follow their , we can isolate their polymer after the polymerization is over from the polymerization medium , then we can get the composition simply by studying the UV spectra , UV - visible spectra of the polymers .	3.6119861636833703

For that of course , we need to know the absorption behavior of the individual homopolymer , like in this case called polybutadiene , and the polystyrene .	4.129948187202943

If we know the individual UV visible spectra , absorption spectra for polybutadiene , and polystyrene homopolymer , then from there we can easily get the composition of polybutadiene - co - styrene .	2.8520817520090755

We can use as we discussed in the case of GPC technique , we can use UV visible detector to find out the molar mass distribution , and we can get spectra , we can detector we can get the GPC , molar mass distribution .	3.982480936738293

And of course , as the pi bonds you know , the conjugation pi bonds , the more the conjugation the higher is the absorption , so I following the conjugate sequence of pi bonds , we can follow the conversion of polyacrylonitrile fiber into carbon fibers .	2.4984904875900837

So , these are some of the examples of UV visible spectroscopy in polymers .	4.048793017377013

And next , we will move there are few more examples like dyes , sometimes we use dyes in a polymers for carbonation .	2.8888103995801777

So , basically , we can use this sort of , we can use UV visible spectroscopy for this sort of use in polymer science .	4.095907231172847

So , next move to the IR spectroscopy , and as I mentioned , we will just mention the basic things about the spectroscopy , and then move to the application polymer science .	3.3752602833584393

Now , as we all know that IR spectroscopy are mainly used in functional group determination , and it is basically , a transition between in different fiber , vibration states of a molecules .	2.8159248549752713

And this energy gap between the vibrational states such that , that it it resonate with the electromagnetic radiation about , having wavelength of 1 micron to 15 micron .	2.198639456941993

So , typically we run IR spectra from say 4000 centimeter inverse to 400 centimeter inverse , and for a non - linear molecules there are n atomic , if the molecule have n atom , the numbers vibrations is 3 n minus 6 , so you can imagine for a polymer molecules which have large number of atoms .	2.8153869757965286

So , many numbers of vibrations are possible , and each have a individual individual absorption in that higher region , so the higher spectra of polymers have lot of this absorption bands , and it is impossible very difficult to assign for a particular reason , or particular vibration , for all the absorption peaks in IR spectra for a polymer .	2.6176942253714217

But , obviously , that does not restrict us to use highest technique to polymer characterization , because the functional groups present in a in a molecule , it may be in the polymer as well , they do not change the absorption the absorption in IR whether , it is present in a small molecule or a large polymer molecule .	3.5907522384676223

So , what happen if we found those particular vibration bands or IR peaks , then we know the , we can assure the presence of those particular functional groups in the polymer , which help us to characterize the polymer molecules .	3.178465839454816

So , as we know that there are a different types of vibrations possible like stretching and bending , and this is important that interaction of matter with IR radiation offers only when this vibrations produces a change in hyper movement .	2.7501429255676775

So , it happens , so the higher spectra , higher absorption happen only for the vibrations or bending vibrations for polar bonds .	2.551949349870816

And this is the chart or carton gives , typically the range where this IR absorption happen for a particular bond vibrations , like range , N H , in this range , see triple bond in then comes this say C over double bonds comes around here .	2.2591913375834567

So , this is basically a guideline for where the peaks come for a corresponding to functional group , polar bonds show strong absorption that IR frequency generally , and intensity shape and the position of this IR bands are typically used to identify the type of absorption .	2.3086975047473626

This is example of H 2 I x spectra for this particular polymer , and this is like this is a particular bond for NH 3 , NH stretching , this is for CH stretching and so on .	3.54285274604274

So , this the IR spectra , for it is not very special in the sense , that it is same as the that the use of IR in detecting the chemical chemical structure of polymer molecules is similar to the application of IR for small organic molecules .	3.6344948342916226

It basically , help us to determine the presence of functional groups in polymer molecules .	5.769029965766566

So , what we will do , we will go next to NMR mass spectroscopy , and now as this all of you may be knowing that NMR is about transition between magnetic energy levels , so few thumb rules like , if the molecules is NMR or a nuclear is NMR active , if the spin number I is not equal to 0 , if it is 0 then it is a it is not a NMR active .	2.6322622295912206

And there few general thumb rules , if the atomic mass if the atomic number are both given then I is 0 , so they are NMR inactive the atomic mass is given , atomic number is odd , then it is I s whole integer , and all nuclei having odd atomic mass , they have a half integers , so like proton , carbon 13 they all have I value of half .	2.066885327536165

Now , they can they can in general term rule of thumb is that , if the I is I has some value than 2 n plus 1 is the numbers of states , they can basically , they have the number of states levels , energy levels , magnetic energy levels .	2.6199830328011746

So , if for a proton I is half , so it can have 2 into half plus 1 , which makes it two different energy levels , which is basically we call this is minus half and plus half .	3.290909395778086

So , what happened , in terms of pictorial representation and this for a proton molecule , this pins are randomly oriented , when there is no external magnetic field , now in the absence of any external magnetic field , these are randomly oriented .	3.143517413525024

Now , if there is external magnetic field applied to the molecule , then they can align in two different way , they can align with the external magnetic field or they can align against the magnetic field ; now there is two states or energy different where this is having higher energy , then this , so this lower energy and this is half energy , less than higher energy .	2.865226944745849

So , in presence of external magnetic field , the nuclei can have two different energy state and now if we apply a nuclear magnetic radiation , whose energy is in this in this gap , in this range .	2.868010854079411

Then sum of the spin , some of the nuclei from this lower energy level , can move to the higher energy level by absorbing the nuclei magnetic radiation .	3.1485701616107247

With increasing external energy , external magnetic field , the energy between the two state increases , and with increasing in the difference between the two energy states , the population is in the lower state which is ground state , becomes more and more compared to the higher states .	3.2376012858046397

So , if we have higher magnetic field , there will be more number of molecules or nuclei in the lower state , then higher state , so when you have a nuclear magnetic radiation coming , the more number of nuclei can move to the higher higher state causing absorption .	3.174526048359986

So , with increasing in external field , the intensity of absorption always go up , and the sensitivity of the instrument , of the of the measurements goes up .	2.9623779231254987

Now , this is we know that in a molecule , in a molecule not every nuclei experience same amount of field basically , in surrounding a nucleus there is there are electron clouds , which basically seals some of the external magnetic field applied .	2.9195108350386922

And the more the shielding , more is the effective ; less is the effective external magnetic field the nuclei experience .	3.265344850060453

So , with the change in the chemical environment around nuclei , the effective magnetic field the nuclei experience will change , and hence the radiation the lambda at which it absorbs .	3.049456660490474

So , if you compare in a in a standard different groups , in case of in case we are talking about hydrogen atom proton , now this protons will have chemical environment , so they will have experience of a different magnetic field ; so the resonance resonance energy will be different .	2.7936368105248275

Now , by though they are very small they can resolved , and so they can be put in a scale , so from the enormous spectra we can get idea about the chemical environment of the of the proton here .	3.5555187967100967

So , the more shielded it has higher delta , lower delta H value , and if it is deshielded , then it is a higher delta H value , now this probably known to you , so I am not spending too much time on this .	3.0673375488275676

There are , this may be also known , but let me complete when you observe a NMR spectra , what does it mean the number of signals or peaks we see in NMR spectra , it means that is the number of equivalent groups of protons or carbon , if you are talking about carbon .	2.86749210312353

So , then spectra NMR spectra , then we are talking about that many number of that many number of equivalent groups of protons present in the molecules ; the chemical shift of the delta H value will give the idea , what type of idea , what type of chemical environment , so what type of group .	2.978240869728112

So , what type of proton or carbon they are , intensity of the signals will be proportional to the number of protons or carbons contributing to a signal , so obviously , the signal from two protons will be double than the signal from one proton .	2.560498758390699

The signals can have splitting which gives the idea about the neighbors , and the line shape whether it is a sharp , or it is broad it gives idea about the interaction of the solvent .	3.1675099456702784

More sophisticated NMR techniques like , relaxation time in a way , they give idea or information about dynamics of a molecule .	2.8274965636384173

So , in case of polymers , we apply lectures in time , if we get the relaxation time , then we can get the information about polymer dynamics , and we gets information about pressure went off atoms .	2.868147378128263

Now , this is interesting in terms of how we apply NMR spectroscopy for polymer science , the discussion about , last few minutes about NMR spectroscopy is about general , which applied to any organic chemistry or any other science NMR , any other course .	2.451260858207409

But this is specific to polymer science or polymer chemistry where we apply NMR for identifying the chemical structure , composition and microstructure ; obviously , the first one is the identification of polymers , and functional group , and this is same as the way we identify the organic molecules from NMR spectra and functional groups , so this is this is not made from the chemicals shift .	3.1880773321515115

And the intensity , and the coupling values we can get information about the polymer , and the functional groups .	4.6051961545623

Obviously , we know which are the monomers we have used for making the polymers , so we have a priory some idea about the NMR spectra , so basically , this confirms that the polymerization has taken place .	3.680743204274647

Obviously , the NMR spectra for the monomer will be different , then it specially different than the polymers for example , if you have vinyl , any vinyl molecules .	4.0593413941297785

So , with polymerization the double bond will be absent , so with progress , with falling intensity of the double bonds and protons in that C C double bond , we can follow the polymerization process .	2.646663205771145

We will just give a example in a minute to elaborate more on that , composition if you are talking about say copolymer between A and B , we will be able to find out using NMR how much A , and how much B , in the final polymer what is type of chain structure , whether it is random or it is alternating or it is a block .	3.0638575753082335

Nature of copolymer ; that is able to we will be able to find out using NMR spectra for a homopolymer , we can get idea about the tacticity , and also if we apply some chemical reaction or if we can find out the end group ; we can get information about the end group present in the polymer .	3.9559258774399604

Now , let us discuss few examples , now this is a NMR spectra , proton NMR spectra form PMMA , this is one example , one PMMA not every PMMA in the lab or plant should look like this ; but it is one example , one PMMA made in the lab , this is the proton spectra of that particular PMMA sample .	3.1004215163785527

Now , this obviously , this shows that the , this is for O methoxy group O methoxy group , and this peaks up for alpha methyl group this one and these two protons are given by here , Now , this alpha , the protons from alpha methyl groups they will have different chemical shift , depending upon the special arrangement of the next carbon for example , if the next carbon here this particular one , if we draw this in explain little bit here .	2.5677231209088958

Now , here it can have two special arrangements , one it can have like CH 3 , and so in this case we as we discussed in terms of copolymerization .	4.383246804285337

And this case , it is if I talk about this thing , they will be different , so all these three arrangement r r , m r and m n they will have different chemical shift .	3.5032596535683247

And from this particular sample it is seen that it is seen that , if you go back and look at that NMR spectra in the computer screen , this this r r is the maximum compared to the other two other two signal .	3.5341244584392233

So , if you compare under this curve which is nothing but the intensity of those signal it comes out approximately 65 percent , and this is 32 percent , and this is 3 percent , which shows that this synthesize PMMA is predominantly a syndiotactic PMMA , if you have this m n groups maximum , then you would have isotactic PMMA maximum Now , let us this is a spectrum for a copolymer of MMA and styrene , so this is a copolymer of copolymer of styrene and MMA , Methyl methacrylate .	3.024877527516877

Now , if you look at this sub NMR of this particular compound , this three proton peaks are for the 5 hydrometric hydrogen of the styrene , is so this 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 this , they are 5 hydrogen , for this 5 hydrogen automatic .	2.5821089317553674

These 3 peaks , 1 , 2 , 3 for this O methoxy protons , for this O methoxy group , and they also not same depending upon whether , they are syndiotatctic or hydrostatic or a isotactic , they are chemical shift value will defer .	2.2985723214514238

This is for your alpha CH 3 of the PMMA group , and these peaks are these 3 carbon atom from polystyrene backbone , and this took hydrogen from the PMMA background .	2.233452049463154

So , what does this spectra help us , this spectra can give us the idea about the composition , for example , if we talk about this 5 hydrogen see , if I consider just consider that you have one styrene molecule , one styrene one styrenic unit rather in the polymer background , so it have 5 hydrogen now the integration corresponded to this is 1.00 , so this is 1.00 for 5 hydrogen .	3.1212883643453213

So , 1 hydrogen give me , this means 1 hydrogen corresponds to 0.2 integration , so if you consider now this alpha CH 3 this is from 3 proton for the NMR it is , now the integration for this 2.5457 .	2.7882701347007535

So , if 1 hydrogen corresponds to 0.22 , 0.57 integration will corresponds to 12.85 multiplied this by 5 you will get 12.85 , so this is the number of protons .	3.792281107990711

Now , each MMA each MMA munity will have 3 hydrogen , so how many MMA munity , if you divided if you divide 12.85 by 3 which is 4 2 8 around 4.28 munity of MMA .	2.35254223885651

So , in this spectra corresponds to 1 styrenic munity , and 4 point may be about 4.28 MMA munity , which means the composition percentage of MMA is 4.28 1 plus 4.28 into 100 , which gives around 81 .	2.3293300344454537

So , from this is one example that using the proton NMR spectra , you can actually get the information about this , the composition of the copolymer .	3.959214530765491

Now , obviously , to do this exercise you have to identify peaks , which are correspondence to particularly 1 munity for example , this one we had for the styrene munity this one for this PMMA munity .	2.733751053238018

So , from this example where we can find out the composition of the copolymer , and what is the copolymer in this case it is , it can be seen it is more of course , syndiotacttic copolymer .	4.5661816915559115

Next example is , this is we are tying to we made a block copolymer of poly tertiary butylacrolate , and polystyrene using living radical polymerization raft , so this is the monomer .	3.635897325576001

First this is the reaction scheme this is the monomer tertiary , and it was reacted with this , it is underground radical polymerization by AIBN in range of heat , in presence of this gel transformation , and you have this first or first block .	3.4768836003055923

So , this is a block of tertiary , butyl , acolyte there should be two ends here to represent this is unit , now from this what we can do , we can get the molecular weight of the first block , and then when we react with a another monomer this case styrene , then we can make a block copolymer , this is also present in this side .	3.3172893415181064

So , we have this is the way we synthesized a block copolymer of this and polystyrene , so from this the NMR structure of this we can get the molecular weight of the first block , and from the NMR of the proton NMR of this second we can get the composition of polystyrene and poly tertiary applied , and obviously , from that we can get , the length block length of the second block as well , how ?	3.5391437519576088

This is the example , the spectra for the first block , which is the tertiary block , the block of tertiary butylacrolate ; now this this peaks corresponding to this 4 aromatic protons , so you cannot see properly .	2.9952044927511614

But , it comes around total 4 hydrogen comes around 1 1 , so this corresponds to 4 hydrogen of 4 aromatic protons .	3.09376574759498

Now , this 0.53 this 0.53 , this 0.53 is from the 3 hydrogen , this 3 hydrogen of the polymer , poly butylacrolate blocks that corresponds to 3 hydrogen hydrogens from poly butylacrolate block .	3.4814489270183153

Now , if 4 hydrogen corresponds to 1 1 , then how many hydrogen it should correspond to 0.11 divided by 4 multiplied by 0.53 , so this is the number of protons , for that particular signal .	3.0937073529483134

So , that the number of tertiary , butylacrolate munities in the first block in the first block is by 4 divided by divide by 3 , 4 hydrogen corresponds to 1 , so 1 hydrogen corresponds to there may be a mistake I am making here , so this could be fine .	2.996434419419449

So , what I may be , the calculation may be something may be little different , but what you understand what you know that , if you consider this R from , this four aromatic protons , and this form this three protons from tertiary , butylacrolate munities , then obviously , you can find out from the intensity ratios .	2.89947301430866

How many protons are there , and from that how many tertiary , butylacrolate groups , and from that you can get the molecular weight of the first block simple .	3.420444228393303

And look at these peaks , this are for the these 3 hydrogen present here in the monomer 1 , 2 , 3 and 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 peaks for the polymer 3 olefinic hydrogen present in the monomer .	3.961064432454102

So , if you had the ratio from the ratio of the peaks of this corresponds to 3 protons for the monomer and this correspondence , and this corresponds to the 3 protons of the polymer , so from this ratio , you can find out what is the conversion of monomer into polymer .	3.251181617792723

So , obviously , with more and more time the reaction goes , this will come down and this will go up as the molecular weight also goes up , so this means that not only using proton proton NMR spectra we can get the molecular weight of the first polymer , but also we can monitor the this is a spectra from fluid sample .	3.7007923526469546

So , we can monitor the amount of conversion of monomer into polymer with time , so basically we can do a kinetic study of kinetic study of the polymerization process .	3.7222656647056263

Now , once you isolate the pure monomer first block , and then add to the , and then reacted with the styrene molecule we get this block copolymer ; obviously , from the ratio .	2.9753355592295874

Now , this if you this is a longer longer chain , so obviously , you can ignore this four aromatic compounds compare to the number of aromatic protons present in the styrene .	4.355480780678283

So , you can assume that all the aromatic protons peaks are from this 5 styrenic munities , whereas , this particular peaks are from the 3 hydrogen ’ s from tertiary butylacrolate munity , and for styrenic munity .	2.458282733758903

So , from the ratio of these two , you can now find out what is the moral ratio of the styrenic munity and the tertiary butylacrolate munity , and you already know the molecular rate of the tertiary butyl munity , so obviously , now you can find out the molecular weight of the styrene munity or styrene block as well .	3.3044740358434375

So , with this is the example where we showed that using proton NMR , you get the molecular weight , and obviously , you need a end group type , which is specific pick for end group it was the styrenic peak , which were available to determination .	2.8997074054310814

So , not only we can find out the molecular weight , we can find out the conversion from monomer to polymer , and also if we add the second monomer to form a block , then we can get the information about the composition of the block , as well as the length of the all the molecular weight of individual block .	4.263980162756507

So , this is example where we showed that the proton NMR can be useful to get information about polymer microstructure .	3.198451736680902

Now , let give , let us give few examples where we talk about carbon 13 NMR , can be used to quantify and identify the polymers .	3.3413021918099317

Let us take a example of polycarbonate , we know we have seen during our first few lectures , this is the way we make polycarbonate , this final a is reacted with a carbonate source , so this is the structure of polycarbonate .	3.422682923052285

Now , from a carbon 13 NMR spectra , we can assign each individual carbons in this polycarbonate and this is this is the special A , this carbon this carbon from the carbonate peak is special , because with help of this spectra we can find out the composition of a copolymer , which will show as a example in the new next slide .	2.80697786086169

So , this is a example of co - polycarbonate which is consist of DPA , and the other compound TNB time , we are talking about , now this carbonate peak we call this A and this A , so this particular is from , if this is if the copolymer have two , this final A group making A carbonate linkage , which we can get information from the disfinal polycarbonate homopolymer .	2.644774930656832

So , we can assign this polymer A from polycarbonate DPA homopolymer , similarly we can make a homopolymer of this particular monomer , there we can know what is the chemical shift for this carbon C 13 peak for this particular carbonate .	3.01993884175859

So , when you have copolymer from the ratio of the three , these three peaks , the amount of this type of carbonate present in the system , so if you these are the example for this copolymer made from this two processes .	4.186061227300877

So , in case of in case of a , say if you are having a 50 : 50 mixture of A and C , these are 2 monomer .	4.8862195150583485

And you can have A C O , you can A C O O C , let us put it B make it , and you can have , so three types of carbonate possible , this one , this three , 1 , 2 , 3 , now this peak we can find out from a homo polycarbonate of A , this one from homo polycarbonate B .	2.6600054761416794

So , the third peak would be from this , now from the ratio of the intensity of these three , we can like in this NMR green spectra , we can find out what is the ratio of this particular type of present in the copolymer .	3.6288734480880196

So , if you go back and look at this screen , computer screen , this is the in this process of polycarbonate this peak is correspondence to A A , this block , this carbonate , and this is corresponding to this particular carbonate , and this is for the this particular group .	3.43227770124023

So , which makes that , this is present in double amount corresponding to this individual , so if you start with a 50 : 50 mixture obviously , if it random it is from a random copolymer , you will get this as a 25 percent , this is 25 percent , and this is 25 percent plus 25 percent 50 percent .	3.882954250611703

So , if it forming A and B is forming a completely random statistical copolymer , then the percentage of these 3 carbonate peaks would be 25 percent 50 percent , and 20 percent that is exactly this is the example of 50 : 50 copolymer , this is where exactly happens .	2.7764620225407146

So , this is , from this curve this NMR we can say that , in this process we get a statistical random copolymer whereas , in this case you can see that the tendency of formation of A block , A type carbon carbonate and C C type carbonate is much higher than the A C or C A type carbonate , which means the polycarbonate here is more of a block in nature , then this , this is a more random work .	3.127265870626373

So , if at least with this type NMR ’ s analysis , we can clearly say that whether a copolymer is a random copolymer or a block type copolymer .	2.524514956174081

So , if you from this chart , we can this is a this is a statistical way of presenting the expected value of mole fraction of the type of linkages in the copolymer , with the mole fraction like in this case , if we have a 50 : 50 composition of A and B , so our composition was mole percent 0.5 .	3.352250898009806

Then this a block would be 25 percent , B B block would be 25 percent , and this alternating A B clock will be 50 percent .	2.6036283001088507

So , this is for a purely statistically random copolymer which is the case for in this case , so this is how we can use NMR , we can get the information about the randomness and the blockiness in this .	4.237660175942789

We have been discussing steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors .	2.9945336307709662

The effect of mass transfer is demonstrated in the performance of immobilized enzyme reactor by virtue of the effect of linear feed velocity in the case of plug flow reactors or the effect of agitation speed in the case of a stirred tank reactor or the effect of particle dimensions or particle size on the performance of enzyme reactor and these parameters influences the rate of enzyme reaction or the performance of the immobilized enzyme reactor demonstrate the role of mass transfer in the performance of the enzymatic catalysis .	3.6688695349885654

We have earlier seen the role of external film diffusion as a result of a thin film that is present on the surface of the catalyst particle in the case of a enzyme reactor and we have considered the interactions of the film diffusion along with the biochemical reaction in the case of a non - porous particle and a combined external film diffusion coefficient ki along with the biochemical reaction constant was determined .	3.6608677664980793

The second case is about the pore diffusion which in fact is much more pronounced in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions because in the case of porous matrices a very large surface area where the enzyme is present is through the pore surface in the catalyst particle and so the second case is if we consider a porous matrix in which the enzyme is immobilized throughout will provide you the case of a pore diffusion regimes .	3.4029466871042957

In general for an isothermal reaction which usually most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions are the effect of internal pore diffusion can be clubbed or can be expressed in a parameter what we know as effectiveness factor .	3.2383476576608

? is called effectiveness factor .	5.861772627807357

? here is the ratio of actual reaction rate in the matrix in the presence of pore diffusion resistances .	5.194883735111545

That means as a result of the substrate concentration gradient that develops in the matrix phase to that of maximum reaction rate obtainable in the absence of any pore diffusional resistance .	3.670374025890523

That means if you consider very fine particles in which the pore diffusional resistances may be negligible or there are no substrate concentration gradient across the particle physical boundaries and that means reaction is taking place in the particle at the same rate in the bulk solution and that ratio is called effectiveness factor .	3.2314881377488045

Physically one can conceive the ………. .. diffusional resistances in the form of very small fine particles to that of the particle which are of larger diameter where the substrate concentration gradient becomes quite severe .	3.4385321158078175

This effectiveness factor has a number of characteristics ; one is that in most cases the effectiveness factor will be less than or equal to one because the present support diffusional limitations will always reduce the substrate concentration in the particle surface .	3.819850086453818

Therefore the substrate concentration at which the reaction will take place actually in the particle boundaries will be less than that in the bulk or at the surface and therefore the effectiveness factor will be less then or equal to one .	4.203867939215625

As I mentioned earlier two specific cases demonstrate where the effectiveness factor can be more than one .	3.1287155144104313

One is in the case of enzyme reactions which are controlled by substrate inhibition kinetics .	5.038647384463146

That means at higher substrate concentration the reaction velocity is inhibited .	5.361243116616764

Therefore as the substrate concentration gradient developed in the particle the concentration drops and the reaction rate can be higher than at the surface and therefore the effectiveness factor can be more than one .	4.3506853590270085

The second case is due to the partitioning effect .	5.890238801512845

If suppose the matrix is charged and the substrate is also charged and if the two species have opposite charges then the concentration of the substrate inside the enzyme particle we will more than that in the bulk and therefore the enzyme reaction rate within the matrix may be more than what is obtained at the matrix surface .	3.4614252357593265

Therefore the effectiveness factor can be more than one in the two cases that we have just elaborated .	5.160913991599773

The second characteristics feature of the effectiveness factor is that it is inversely propositional to particle size .	4.588228820598514

If you reduce the particle size the effectiveness factor can approach to unity which means that the whole of the matrix of the immobilized enzyme particle is able to get adequate substrate and carry out the biochemical reaction .	3.7808095334827803

In experimental conditions usually no pore diffusional resistance is obtained that means effectiveness factor is approaching one with particles of diameter less than thirty microns and average pore size greater than two thousand angstroms .	2.189116366285781

That means either the pore diameter is large or the particle size is reduced .	3.4298700394126795

Also the effectiveness problem can be more serious when substrates of low diffusivities are to be processed .	3.0473558988256917

If you take a substrate which has low diffusivity in the matrix the problem is more serious because the rate of diffusion is slower than the biochemical reaction rate .	3.7260622011606106

Therefore the relative rate of diffusion and the relative rate of biochemical reaction are the other features which control the effectiveness factor .	3.950112173818769

The diffusional coefficient , the …. .. diffusivity of a particular substrate in an empty matrix and in the case of an immobilized enzyme particle where the path of diffusion is quite haphazard , it makes a quite a different diffusivity .	3.2366509369025893

Very often in the case of immobilized enzyme particle we call it effective diffusivity rather than diffusivity .	4.282711795727337

Normally we take an ordinary particle , a spherical particle where the pores are very uniform ; say for example you have a sphere where the pores are identical , for example control pore glass then the path of diffusion is linear and of the same dimensions .	2.992579097711221

Whereas in the case of actual particles what we have encountered in the case of immobilized enzyme systems the path of diffusion is really not linear and uniform through out the particle and it can happen that you have pores almost going in a random manner in the whole particle and therefore the diffusivity that we obtained from theoretical considerations of a spherical particle is in effect different than what is obtainable of a particle at that dimensions assuming a uniform cylindrical pore .	2.6079878409699533

We have also mentioned last time that if you want to analyze the simultaneous mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme particle it can be expressed assuming a cylindrical pore model .	3.522402351603682

That means you assume that the substrate diffuses into the particle in the form of a cylindrical pore .	4.254968283509575

In practice it may not be actually like a cylindrical pore but just to simplify a geometric similarity and to analyze it we are just assuming as cylindrical pore and then instead of taking molecular diffusivity we consider effective diffusivity which takes care of the random nature of the pores .	2.5849689440673758

Simultaneous mass transfer and biochemical reaction in the matrix can be analyzed in the form of a second order differential equation .	4.012402355576875

In the substrate concentration profile here we consider this as single pore and this pore refers to half the particle depth .	3.274517316554688

There will be another pore on this side of the same dimension so whatever dimension of the particle we are considering let us say if it is a pallet of thickness twelve we consider l as the thickness because the substrate will be accessible on both the sides .	2.9430769559786647

Similarly if it is a sphere the radius is the major dimension which is important here in terms of X and therefore one needs to consider only half the particle for getting an analytical solution for the substrate concentration profile .	3.5875914846091934

The substrate concentration profile for such a second order differential equation is usually obtained interms of a Thiele modulus .	3.012992391463684

f here is defined as Thiele modulus in general which is defined as a lump parameter like this which is f = l. [ ktrue.Ssm - 1 / De ] 1 / 2 ktrue is the reaction kinetic constant in the absence of any pore diffusional effects that means in the surface or in the bulk .	3.133002123388377

Ss is the substrate concentration of the surface and m is the order of reaction whatever the order of reaction and De is the effective diffusivity .	5.351586277061456

The solution of this differential equation is usually expressed in the form of Thiele modulus and a large number of workers have given the solution of this expression both for zero as well as the first order reactions for which the analytical solution can be easily obtained .	3.483210013748347

But very often for practical purposes we try to look at our reaction conditions and consider if they are closer to zero order or first order depending upon the percentage error that is involved in calculating the space time under the given set of conditions which are the inlet substrate concentration and outlet substrate concentration in the reactor and with in that regime that means fractional conversion and initial substrate concentration in that regimes if the reaction is more close to zero order we very conveniently consider our system as zero order and make the design calculations or in case if it is more closer the percentage error is less in the case of first order kinetics we go for a first order design calculations .	3.0679788656839584

But alternatively …… solution using Michaelis Menten kinetics also can be obtained numerically .	4.881357204577743

The effectiveness factor for all those system is a function of the Thiele modulus in all cases whatever is the order of reaction whether it is first order , zero order or Michaelis Menten kinetics , the effectiveness factor is always a function of Thiele modulus and this function varies basically on the order of reaction as well as on the particle geometry .	3.686470047079275

That means whether particle is a sphere or a chip or a cylindrical pallet or whatever be the shape , it varies ; the relationship between the effectiveness factor and the Thiele modulus .	2.659662082392165

As I mentioned earlier the Thiele modulus is a function of the true rate constant , the substrate concentration on the surface and the effective diffusivity and physically if you look at , the Thiele modulus gives you an indication although its not an exact ratio but it really gives you a ratio between the two reaction rate or reaction rate parameters to that of rate of diffusion .	3.363344603264342

The numerator expresses the parameter resembling the rate of reaction and the denominator represents the rate of diffusion and the Thiele modulus is an expression of the ratio between the two things .	3.9301421152083744

So if the Thiele modulus is high , the reaction rate is faster .	5.76788263444405

Smaller Thiele modulus means the rate of diffusion is smaller .	5.328359837743629

If you simplify the Thiele modulus expressions either for a zero order or a first order reaction it becomes still simpler .	3.13895271212951

For a zero order system it is f = l. [ ktrue. / De .	4.070980667752151

Ss ] 1 / 2 That means the Thiele modulus is inversely proportional to the substrate concentration at the surface .	6.299570232014369

On the other hand for the first order reactions the Thiele modulus is independent of substrate concentration because 1 - 1 is zero and so it becomes independent of substrate concentration .	3.3996437610725683

One can write the reactor performance equation as - K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) 1 1 1 e ?	5.631789746154278

= [ ( - ) ] k ’ 2E0 f tanh3 f 3 f The expression for effectiveness factor is given in the parenthesis .	3.1305800179678953

The expression in the parenthesis is same and you remember we have defined right at the beginning that the reactor performance can be simplified by taking a reaction rate expression which is multiplied by effectiveness factor .	3.1914044725450244

This is in the case of spherical particles .	7.40255448809637

The same expressions when you talk of packed bed of chips that means very thin films of very fine thickness let us say of the thickness l .	2.7328453376447794

In that case the tow is given as - K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) tanh f e ?	3.1456715720838475

= [ ] k ’ 2E0 f The effectiveness factor here is different ; tanh f / f where the particle thickness is very , very small .	2.840185337789541

These expressions have been obtained analytically in the case of different particle size like in the case of thin films and for spheres .	3.605027222711768

They are mentioned even for cylindrical pallets , discs .	3.7024592107389207

A number of such expressions are already available in the literature which can be used .	4.926478774796992

Based on this I think one of the major studies which were reported in seventies was particularly on the mass transfer in immobilized enzyme reactor by Rovito and Kitrell .	3.0347710469541243

They made physical measurements experimentally of the Thiele modulus and also calculated the effectiveness factor based on these expressions and they gave for both sphere as well as discs of different thicknesses and confirmed the validity of the first order reaction rate expression applicable in many cases of packed bed reactors .	2.856947566952563

The data points shown here are experimental data with different particle sizes say for example from hundred twenty microns to thousand microns .	2.5320837039711948

They used controlled pore glass and immobilized it with glucose oxidase and measured the reactor performance with different particles sizes , the value of effectiveness factor based on the experimental data that means by taking the ratio of the actual reaction rate for a particular particle diameter divided by the reaction rate at which particularly with a very small particle size say thirty microns .	3.4494417207956865

They also calculated the same reactor performance using the analytically developed reactor design equation and they found almost very good fit both in the case of sphere as well as in the case of disks .	3.0750124385630286

Y - axis is effectiveness factor and X–axis is Thiele modulus .	3.7719728945963404

The relationship between pore diffusional limitations and the Thiele modulus is explained in terms of effectiveness factor because if you know effectiveness factor you can have reactor performance equation , where you multiply reactor rate expression which is ?	3.8881269418504636

.K2E0 / Km , a pseudo first order rate constant for an enzyme catalyzed reaction or if zero order which is K2E0 and multiply by the effectiveness factor which you are aware of .	3.43077970515276

Another thing which also has been checked experimentally , another factor which influences the reactor performance as a result of pore diffusion is the effect of increasing the enzyme loading .	3.691736791915566

Basically what you are doing when you increase the enzyme loading is you are changing the Thiele modulus .	4.5655223125680084

The numerator in the Thiele modulus which gives you the reaction rate constant is increasing because the concentration is high .	5.219607418987388

If it is first order rate constant , K2E0 / Km in the case of immobilized enzyme catalyzed reaction then the value of E0 is increasing by enzyme loading and therefore as you increase the enzyme loading in this direction and some arbitrary values of let us say one , ten and hundred you notice that the effectiveness factor very sharply decreases .	3.4368558315119015

That means the enzyme reactor system becomes more and more controlled by diffusional limitations and when the enzyme loading is less the diffusional limitations are less .	3.823772055592982

Up to quite a large particle size it can be considered almost free of diffusional limitations .	3.9493232437527297

Increasing the enzyme loading influences the increase in f , the Thiele modulus .	4.709907545865023

The Thiele modulus on the numerator is Ktrue that is the true rate constant which is K2E0 / Km in the case of enzyme reactor for first order or in the case of zero order it is K2E0 .	3.8221978202992735

So increasing enzyme loading means the concentration of enzyme is being increased .	4.758820523062867

E0 is increasing so f is increasing and increasing Thiele modulus gives you a lower effectiveness factor which means that the rate of reaction is must faster than the rate of diffusion and that is what the ratio is described by Thiele modulus and therefore the effectiveness factor decreases .	3.660493872065433

If you keep on increasing the loading you will have a very significant effect upon the final reactor performance and ultimately it may happen that the loading may have no function ; the whole reactor performance will be controlled by only rate of diffusion .	3.179129421724038

In many cases numerical solutions have been found in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics which indicates the effect of Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor as a function of ß something like a dimension less Michaelis Menten constant which is the ratio of K ’ m / S0 .	3.677632853893964

It shows the effect of shift from zero order to first order .	3.9893815423811687

The shift is when ß is small the K ’ m / S0 is also small and whereby you see the effect of ß on the effectiveness factor as a function of Thiele modulus .	3.6081783279907675

In this case also as the Thiele modulus or the beta value increases the reaction shifts from zero order to first order .	2.694046579008315

ß value is increasing means from zero order to first order and in that case the effectiveness factor decreases and the same effect from the Thiele modulus is obtained in either directions .	3.0182348767355363

In the case of analysis of the internal pore diffusion in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor , the analysis amounts to determination of effectiveness factor for a particular system and that is directly controlled by the value of effective diffusivity , the reaction rate constant and the size of particles what we are considering .	4.089190542447168

If you consider say for example a combined film and pore diffusional effects and for a simplistic case of a first order irreversible enzyme catalyzed reaction , we can club the two things for example the external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion along with the biochemical reaction and the flux of the substrate can be then written as J = kL ( Sb - SS ) You will recall that in the external film diffusion , flux of substrate along the particle surface is given by kL which is the external film diffusion coefficient into the substrate concentration gradient that is developed in the film and that if we could equate to ?	3.175242456461792

.Kf.SS J = kL ( Sb - SS ) = ?	4.243432360404136

.Kf.SS This is the factor ; this is the rate of reaction or the flux through the pore diffusional limitations .	4.7770887968829445

The pore diffusional resistance is expressed by ?	5.63765831749678

. Kf is the first order rate constant which can be also be written as k ’ 2E0 / Km and Ss is the substrate concentration at the surface of the particle .	4.8039570526784505

If you simplify this you can write ( Sb - SS ) / J = 1 / kL That is the inverse of the film diffusion coefficient and also Ss / J = 1 / ?	4.308684519292503

kf ; Sb / J = 1 / kL + 1 / ?	14.471049536223283

kf If this Sb / J is the main flux taking into account both external film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion and the first factor 1 / kL is resistance provided by external film diffusion and the second expression is a resistance term due to pore diffusional limitations then the overall effect is a sum of these two resistances and Sb / J will be the flux which will really be expressed in the case of a reactor performance which experiences both film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion .	2.795218291618762

For example if you carry out continuous immobilized enzyme reactor and determine the reactor performance and if you assume that you carry out the steady state reactor performance at various feed velocities that is linear flow velocities what you are doing is we are varying the kL value .	3.323777884105897

We know that increasing the linear flow velocity will influence the kL value .	3.5498459838141834

1 / 1 / kL will be increased by increasing the flow velocity the kL will decrease and the 1 / 1 / kL will increase .	3.662560160181585

If you plot flow rate inverse verses the overall rate constant , 1 / k ’ , which is defined as the apparent reaction rate constant which takes into account biochemical reaction and also the external film diffusion as well as internal pore diffusion , then you get almost linear velocity with the intercept at 1 / ?	3.056203719446701

.Kf where Kf is pseudo first order rate constant .	3.160502316345608

To get such a performance if you carry out the reaction at a low substrate concentration or even at a high substrate concentration degree of conversion fractional conversion is very high though the reactor performance will be closer to the first order kinetics .	3.911644509095675

If you consider the reactor performance in terms of zero order or first order kinetics and if you take any substrate concentration of the feed and carry out the substrate conversion to very high level then you will have the overall reactor performance which is much closer to a first order kinetics .	4.283868904600878

If the conversion level is not very high then the reactor performance will be controlled by zero order kinetics .	4.192326813025692

If the outlet substrate concentration is also very high compare to the inlet substrate concentration the reaction can be considered or atleast approximated to be equal to zero order kinetics but if the conversion is very high so that the outlet substrate concentration is very low then you can always approximate to be a first order reaction .	4.07534256205821

kf . kf is known to you depending on the kinetic parameters of the immobilized enzyme .	5.412579831724301

So the value of the effectiveness factor can be theoretically calculated and also the K ’ , the overall reaction rate constant which takes into account the biochemical reaction and combined film and pore diffusional effects .	3.1842716881846043

The K ’ can be used as a first order rate constant for design of the immobilized enzyme continuous reactor .	5.257287162131783

Finally I would like you to leave with a small exercise .	4.402824100516244

Consider that the analytical solutions of a internal pore diffusion and biochemical reaction can be determined by a second order differential equation .	3.6060159171032584

Let us assume that we are given some solution for the first order reactions .	4.231836947607487

If you assume that the reaction is towards zero order kinetics that means the initial substrate concentration used is high and fractional conversion will also be not very high .	4.07413526686092

If you start the feed inlet concentration say at hundred times the Km value and the final substrate concentration from the effluent is let us say fifty Km .	2.962426608906259

The whole reactor will operate almost closer towards zero order regimes and that expression can be given by Ded2S / dX2 – k ’ 2E0 = 0 If you consider that we are talking of a cylindrical disk with a thickness of 2l , I would like you to develop this solved equation to get the substrate concentration profile as a function of distance from the centre .	2.9611329390816623

If this is the distance x on either sides that means the distance of the surface from the center is x on either sides .	3.879969540007872

The substrate concentration profile in such a thick membrane needs to be evaluated based on the second order differential equation .	3.802923728063028

You can consider the substrate concentration as Ss if you leave out the external film diffusion and on the other hand X = 0 .	3.7989310249365422

That means at the center of the particle ds / dx is also equal to zero .	3.8493543474859147

Under these two boundary conditions you simplify and get an expression for S / Ss and rearrange that in the form of Thiele modulus .	3.3672624657147603

For zero order f0 = l [ k ’ 2E0 / De.Ss ] 1 / 2 This will be Thiele modulus and so rearrange the expression in the form of f and get the reactor performance or you can also find it out that at what thickness from the center that is at what value of x let us say x is equal to some critical value of l when the substrate concentration approaches to zero .	3.153774086648364

That means that fraction of enzyme will be ineffective and the ratio of the two that is l / lc will give you effectiveness factor .	3.694909355060286

I like you to do this exercise and solve this differential equation under this boundary condition and arrive at two things ; one is the substrate concentration profile within the immobilized enzyme particle and interms of surface substrate concentration and second thing is this length from the centre , the value of lc at which the substrate concentration tends to be zero .	2.974527918551546

If you assume that then the boundary conditions will change .	3.5565251856737046

Is that alright ?	12.375943181555938

I think we will stop at this point .	3.477445581119335

And we now theoretically know that what once we do a polymer synthesis , what are the different types of molecular weight and what are the different types of molecular weight distribution we can get from our previous learning from last few lectures .	3.636325582489522

Now , what we are going to learn in next few lectures is that how to characterize .	3.3371826125742157

Once you made this polymer of course we want to know that what we have made both in chemical term ; that means what is the constitution ?	4.375908032143189

What is the chemical constitution ?	7.756625923808076

So , there will be always a molecular distribution associated with when we make a polymer .	4.033613518685026

So , for the polymers which we already synthesized how what is the molecular weight distribution ?	5.20659782773054

Now for that , what we will begin today is to understand polymers in solution .	4.4468901106617515

And in today ’ s lecture , we are going to learn lattice theory of solutions for small molecules and then learn about ideal solutions , thermodynamic probability and distribution and the Boltzmann equation and then learn about polymer Huggins theory of polymer solutions ; these are the sub topics which we will learn during this lecture .	2.48717594235367

Now as I said that we are going to learn polymers in solutions or polymer solution .	3.806578401151499

Now why do we need to study polymers in solution ?	4.710436198009146

As I was just mentioning that once we made this polymer , we must characterize both chemically and physically and one of the most important parameter is the molecular weight .	2.9173902948114585

Now as you will see in after few lectures that most of this polymer characterization techniques for example , molecular measurements , chemical characterization , etc are done in solution .	3.012599642592561

So unless we do not know how polymers behave in solution , we will not be able to understand how polymer characterization is done .	3.8112857187157134

So , polymers are used in the applications where the final form of the product is in solution form .	5.427251915638349

So , we must know the behavior of the polymers in solutions to understand how we can utilize these synthesize polymers in those applications .	4.187187747743876

Also biomacromolecules for example , proteins , nucleic acids ; though these polymers are not part of this course but as a comparison biomacromolecules they function mainly in aqueous environment and to understand the behavior of this biomacromolecules , one must understand the solution behavior of this molecules and the solution behavior of thermodynamics of polymer solutions is for a synthetic polymers are very similar to the treatment you will see for biomacromolecules .	3.0038652785654034

So , if you understand the thermodynamics of polymer solution for synthetic polymers , you will also be able to easily understand the behavior of macromolecules in solution biomacromolecules in solution .	3.337655284918178

So , let us start with thermodynamics of polymer solution and for a solution as we know that the solution can be defined as a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances ; homogeneous means that the mixture is at molecular level .	3.516930660005514

And of course we know that from our basic understanding of thermodynamics that usual thermodynamic condition of constant temperature and pressure , for a two component system , spontaneous formation of solution requires that the Gibbs free energy of the solution is lower than the sum of the Gibbs free energy of the solvent and the solute G 1 and G 2 .	2.7383954287171033

And in other words you can write that Gibbs free energy of mixing ; Gibbs free energy which is given by the difference in the Gibbs free energy of the solution or the mixture and the sum of the individual Gibbs free energy of the solvent and solute should be negative too , so that the solution can form continuously .	3.7064499841395397

And we also know that the Gibbs free energy mixing can be expressed in terms of enthalpy of mixing and entropy of mixing .	4.38478628574572

So , this should be lower than 0 .	9.093595533168441

Now let us start with ideal solutions of small molecules .	3.6568398264909443

Now ideal solution is a mixture of molecules having identical size .	5.083422846574905

We call a solution as ideal solution when the ingredients all the components solute and the solvent are having same size ; the individual sizes , molecular sizes are same .	2.595836249273689

And once the molecular size is same molar volume is same ; the mole fraction would be equals to the volume fraction and the change in or volume of mixing would be 0 .	3.1485477984624795

So , there will be no change in volume after mixing of the components .	3.86844213815342

Now of course there is another condition that force acting between the like and the unlike molecules ; similar and dissimilar molecules are equal or in other words if you have , say , 1 as your solvent and 2 as your solute , then interaction between 1 - 1 solute - solute solvent - solvent and 2 - 2 solute - solute is same as the interaction between the solute and solvent molecules which is 1 - 2 interaction .	2.7134367566804634

So , energy of mixing should be 0 and as you have seen that volume of mixing is also 0 .	5.196067512963649

So , enthalpy of mixing should be 0 .	8.000278009193996

Now if there is no change in the enthalpy of the system on mixing or when the solute and solvent mix and form a solution , the entropy of mixing delta S m would depend only on the combinatorial entropy .	3.673431720249579

The other entropies like transitional , vibrational , and rotational entropy are associated with molecules .	2.914401370862586

They will not change at all because there is no change in thermal energy in the system delta H m is 0 .	4.13861895303922

So , those entropies will not change .	6.002669234871535

So on mixing , the only change in the entropy would be the combinatorial entropy and what is the combinatorial entropy or configurational entropy is the number of ways you can arrange a different molecules .	3.712691909458504

Number of distinguishable ways you can arrange different molecules ; the more number of such numbers , then the entropy of mixing is higher .	3.4709404478375476

So , mixing becomes easier .	8.209643851779166

Let us discuss little more in next page .	4.6226978040321285

Combinatorial entropy of the system is given by the number of possible distinguishable spatial arrangements .	6.153095719411207

So for a given state , we know from out statistical thermodynamics or statistical mechanics that Boltzmann equation gives the relation between the combinatorial entropy and W which is the number of possible distinguishable degenerate arrangement .	2.803611067641155

W is the possible distinguish ; all the arrangement you are doing by changing the position of the molecules has to be distinguished and they have to be of the same energy because in this case of ideal solution because interaction energies are same between like and unlike molecules So , once if you do interchange between solute and solvent molecules , they will produce degenerate arrangements .	3.10336035874793

Now let us talk about how to calculate this combinatorial or configurational entropy and we are continuing our discussion with most simpler system of ideal solution .	2.5955908181044003

And you have N 1 is the number of solvent molecule and N 2 is the number of solute molecules and N 0 is N 1 plus N 2 which is the total number of molecules .	4.362419747321917

Now we have said or we have seen earlier that in case of ideal solution , the sizes of solute and the solvent molecules are similar .	4.184121244046347

So , we can have a one 3D cell 3D lattice which have N 0 number of cells and the size of the cell of each cell is same as the size of the one molecule .	3.4885248875329378

Now in this slide it is shown as one of the 2D version of the 3D .	4.571847184136065

You can imagine that it is it is a 3D lattice .	7.275647389342263

So now , we have N 0 number of cells and N 0 number of molecules and each size of this cell is equal to the size of one molecule .	4.342289446266256

Now let us put or place the solute and solvent molecules ; solute are and will be shown as number 2 in this course and it is typically shown as 2 and solvent will be represented as 1 .	2.854145724792785

So , N 2 number of solute molecules and N 1 number of solvent molecules which are shown in this colors and total N 1 and N 2 is the total number of molecules and they are placed randomly in this cell .	3.5486280543529007

So now , you have to calculate how many different ways you can arrange this molecules .	4.326538497435897

Now total number molecule is N 0 which is N 1 plus N 2 .	4.385662523904466

So , total number of ways you can arrange these total molecules is factorial of N 0 ; this is the number of ways you can arrange all these molecules .	3.0405240450375235

Now , if you replace one solvent molecule with another or you can change the position of the solvent molecules with another solvent molecule , you can imagine that you are not creating another distinguishable arrangement .	3.541699623824781

Basically there this two arrangement of replacing one solvent molecule or interchanging one solvent molecules with another or one solute molecule with another solute molecules will not give you any indistinguishable arrangement .	2.448877014371431

So , these arrangements are overestimated .	5.533076117337492

So , actual number of distinguishable arrangements would be ; you divide by the N 1 factorial and N 2 factorial .	2.9698185674349844

So , quickly the combinatorial entropy will be given by Boltzmann equation .	5.195240220754273

I will just do quickly N 1 factorial plus N 2 factorial divided by N 1 factorial and N 2 factorial .	2.8129669406363482

So , you can apply this and you can write S is equal to k N 0 ln N 0 minus N 0 ; this is N 0 factorial .	4.700647120544099

So , you can just use this Stirling ’ s approximation and you get this expression .	3.6157068870817977

Now I continue further simplification you will get .	5.125984125732753

So , this k is Boltzmann constant that you known previously .	3.81336548613242

Now mole fraction represented by X i or I can write capital X i mole fraction is N i by N 0 .	2.8847601381140966

So , S could be given by k N 1 ln X 1 plus N 2 ln X 2 .	3.8514824161348225

This is the S case for the mixture .	4.756363194939142

So , I can write this is for the mixture S m .	5.974507980396734

Now for pure solvent and solute , what will be the w ?	5.008864329342898

So , w 1 is 1 and w 2 for the solute is also 1 .	4.149566809741279

So , case one is 0 and S 2 is also k ln w 2 is 0 .	3.825397401093058

So , this is the combinatorial entropy for the mixture and this is entropy for the solvent and this is for the solute before mixture .	5.161061958615419

So , what is the entropy of mixture mixing in this case is same ; entropy of the mixture S 2 is given by S m and it is the same what we have seen earlier .	5.06831496920668

So , N 2 is the number of moles of the solute .	6.162776388999166

Now what is del H m for the ideal solution is zero .	4.61708387819982

So , del G m which is Gibbs free energy of mixture would be del H m minus T del S m ; we get k T N 1 ln X 1 plus N 2 ln X 2 or R T N 1 ln X 1 plus N 2 ln X 2 .	2.30928400156226

So , this is your expression for Gibbs free energy of mixing Gibbs free energy .	4.0286362566278635

This is the mole fraction for solvent , this is for solute , this is number of moles for solvent , then this is number of moles for the solute .	4.084154676910279

So , we can write for this ideal solution entropy of mixing is given by this expression and remember this is the same as we have seen from Raoult ’ s law which keeps the expression of entropy of mixing for Gibbs free energy for the ideal solution .	3.755421724056117

Now what about non - ideal solution ?	5.5442618193799795

Second is regular solution ; entropy of mixing is same as ideal solution but enthalpy of mixing is not 0 .	4.229907043611146

And third is irregular where enthalpy of mixing is not 0 and entropy of mixing also not same as the ideal solution .	3.8454179719828723

Now non - ideal solution of small molecules is invariably due to non - athermal mixing .	3.4066633899628043

As you know from your physical chemistry knowledge that any non - ideality which happens in case of solutions for small molecules are due to non - athermal mixing or delta H mixing is not equal to 0 .	2.9715084706683954

For polymer molecules for polymer solutions this non - ideality is generally due to both .	3.1005387734319645

It is both for non - athermal mixing ; del H mixing is not equals to 0 and also contribution from other than combinatorial entropy .	3.1014326082252324

So in case of polymer solution , the non - ideal behavior of polymer solution or a polymer solution behave unlike a ideal solution of small molecule we juts discussed ; because of both the reasons , in most cases , the enthalpy of mixing or enthalpy of solution for a polymer in a solvent is not equal to 0 , delta h mixing is not equal to 0 .	3.192134799370348

And also for ideal solution , it is only the combinatorial entropy which contributes to the Gibbs free energy change for the mixing .	3.8009569424161245

In case of polymer solution , as we will see in a moment that , it is not only the combinatorial entropy ; it is also the entropy change induced by the athermal process also contributes the Gibbs free energy of mixing .	3.4645661407725905

And in most cases vapor pressure of the polymer solutions are invariably much lower than what has been predicted from the Raoult ’ s law which is the law describing the ideal solution .	3.3199645729010503

So , how do get this combinatorial entropy or Gibbs free energy for mixing for the polymer solution ?	3.8125674441997415

We have till now done the Gibbs free energy of mixing for solution ideal solution for small molecules .	3.0660142350072803

Now we will try to apply the same lattice theory to find out the Gibbs free energy of mixing for the polymer solvent mixture or a solution of a polymer in a solvent .	3.6836901720418807

Recall that in case of ideal solution , the molecules are having same size but in polymer obviously when you are dissolving a large polymer molecule in a solvent molecules , the size of polymer molecules are much higher than solvent molecules .	3.9155761281455415

So , this assumption which we made for ideal solution is not valid here ; the sizes are solvent molecules and solute molecules .	3.488078767067373

In this case , the polymer molecules is much higher is very different .	5.970390965566682

And in case in the ideal solution we had seen that del H mixing is 0 because of the force of like and unlike molecules are 1 , 1 2 , 2 is equals to 1 , 2 and in most often interaction between polymer and a solvent molecule is not athermal .	3.4564303097581766

In most cases they are specific interaction between polymer and solvent molecule is different than the interaction between a solvent - solvent molecule or a polymer - polymer molecules .	3.984342788778244

So , these are the two main difference of a polymer solution than an ideal solution of the small molecules .	3.8878228143997946

Now the two scientists Paul Flory and Maurice Huggins they proposed the theory which we will know in a minute which took consideration of the large difference in the size for the solute and this is polymers and the solvent and existence of the intermolecular interactions .	3.444925747290604

Again we will have the same 3D lattice in this case as well but here the difference is that N 1 is again the number of solvent molecules and N 2 is number of polymer molecules .	4.486577411796435

Obviously , the sizes of the polymer molecules and the solvent molecules are different .	6.519907191454742

So what we are doing , we breaking or dividing the polymer molecule in to x segments ; dividing a single polymer molecule in to x segments where the size of the each segment is same as the size of a solvent molecule .	2.8197432786021017

So , x is v 2b y v 1 where v 2 is the molar volume of polymer and v 1 is the molar volume of solvent .	2.9437885293515103

So , what we are doing ?	9.06825099348027

We are breaking polymer or dividing a single polymer chain in to x segments where the size of each segment is same as the solvent molecules .	3.4740267309459743

So , each polymer molecule has x segments .	5.084764432640403

So , N 2 number of polymer molecules has N 2 into x segments .	4.380172691234089

So , these are the total number of polymer segments in the solution or in the mixture .	4.99826381138225

So , we require N 1 plus N 2 x which is N 0 ; this is the number of lattice we require where each size of each lattice is either same as the size of solvent molecules or same as the size for a segment of a polymer .	3.532768337169844

So , in general we have N 0 number of cells where N 1 is the number of solvent molecules and each size of the each cell is same as the size of the solvent molecules and x is number of segment of a single polymer chain and size of the segment is same as the size of the cell .	3.932490142790422

So , we have N 0 number of cells ; N 0 is given by N 1 plus x N 2 .	4.11244466017274

What we are going to do is find out first how many different ways we can arrange the polymer segments .	3.5248400200632757

We are going to add the polymers in those in this 3D lattice , one after one ; we are going to add the polymer chains in this lattice one after one , one segment after one segment and once we added all the polymer chains then we will add the solvent molecules .	3.5244019045269965

This is the approach what we are taking ; we will add the polymers one by one and for single polymers we will add each segment one after one .	3.3948567204413966

Now how are we going to add this polymer segments .	4.222454101835965

See since we have already i ; i is the number of polymers already added .	4.8445329531541095

So , we have already added in this 3D lattice which are we are not showing ; those i number of polymer molecules are not shown here to make this picture clear .	3.378122922110781

So , you have to understand that there are already i number of polymers present which means i into x number of cells are already occupied .	3.4186052784711363

Each polymer has x number of segment if we had i number of polymers which is already added .	4.315295994513852

So , i minus x cells are already occupied .	4.081900156362816

So , N 0 minus i x is the number of vacant cell where in the next one , i plus 1 polymer chain we can place .	3.4873115382919506

This is the number of cells which are vacant , because N 0 was total number of cells and i x is the total number of cells that are already occupied .	3.3252035619913007

So , N 0 minus i x is the number of vacant cells .	3.691014866164174

So , this is the number of cells where we can place the next polymer molecule which is i plus 1th , i plus first .	3.573603968462604

Now i plus this polymer chain has how many segments ?	4.567713869182962

Again x segments ; this i plus 1 , i plus first chain has x segments .	3.3661904349714518

So , the first segment of this polymers ; let me write this .	4.505115009912905

This is the number of vacant cells available for this i plus first polymer chains to get in .	3.6165135382274816

Now the first segment ; now as I said earlier that I am showing this all are vacant , but these are all vacant i x number of cells are already blocked , already occupied .	2.96148822172328

So , N 0 minus x i is the number of cells which are available .	5.173377665798739

So , how many different ways you can place the first segment of polymer ?	4.55627968142422

There are N 0 minus x i number of vacant cell .	4.576138290197355

So , the first segment of i plus first polymer can we added how many different ways ?	3.207479052068616

Of course , it can be added any of these vacant cells .	5.352518812947602

So , it can be added in this many ways .	6.399646692481461

So , this is the number of vacant cells available for the segments to go in .	3.5192887619540856

So you can arrange , you can place or you can locate the first segment in any of these vacant cells .	3.9241215941290566

So , this is the number of ways you can add the first segment .	4.9741826994001475

What about the second segment ?	10.193295230330344

If I want to add another molecule , another segment , not molecule ; if I want to add another segment where it has to stay of course unlike the small molecules where the molecules are apart from each other .	2.726462012187924

For polymers the segment has to be tied up because there the segments are joined to each other .	3.304515041700431

So , they can be placed in any of this first level .	5.898302553216638

So , if z is the coordination number which is the number of cells present in the first level , you can add in any of these cells .	4.602568943952423

So , I can add , say , I can add here .	4.146849098111347

So , second segment can be placed in any of this z cells .	4.252906840062158

Now what is the chance that all the z cells are vacant ; Remember the lattice already has x i number of block cell .	2.8289851665574934

So , it is not that all the z number of cells will be free for the second segment to go in ; there is a probability .	4.257290297517014

So if I write the probability as p I , then the number of ways the second segment can be placed is z p ; p is the probability that the cell is vacant .	3.022041112255708

Now what is that probability ?	5.935627647306875

Total number of empty cells is N 0 minus x i divided by total number of cells .	3.5546582399911615

So , this is the probability ; chances of that one of the cells if you choose and pick any of the cell from this lattice , this is the probability that it will be vacant because this is the number of cells which are vacant and this is the total number of cells present in the lattice .	4.416195906719278

So , this is the probability and this is the second segment ; number wise if second segment can be placed is z p .	3.758296596966484

From third to the last which is x z how many different way you can add ?	4.33962383539581

You can add basically the same way ; it is basically the same way you have added the second one , you have to add third , fourth , fifth , sixth , etc , the same way you have to arrange .	3.534038346351821

So , each third segment can be placed again by z p way ; four segments can be placed in z multiplied by p s and so on .	2.3571646521124845

So , total number of way is then .	5.244202501079075

So , the total number of ways the polymer segments of i plus first chain can be placed and will be given by the multiplication of all this segments ; first segment N 0 plus x i second segment z p .	2.970352815393106

What I just missed here is that when you have one sample , second sample can be placed any of this z coordination number but for the third one , one is already blocked ; one of the z is blocked .	3.4342704776922224

So if I place third here , I can place third here ; I can place here , I can place here , I can place here .	2.1378333125903777

One of this is already blocked ; I cannot place here .	4.290816546890159

So , it has to be z minus 1 .	7.826474794693669

Fourth one again z minus 1 ; so that is you have to remember , so z minus 1 p .	4.0312870135182575

So , this is for the second segment , this is for the second segment , and this is for the third to the last segment .	4.7148692067200875

Now , what I will do ?	6.443040444656267

I will quickly go through the mathematical part , not plus this is minus .	3.8725758658573635

Now z , because z is quite high so I can again put z equals to minus z minus 1 .	2.896332505422583

So , I can make z minus 1 ; z z minus x minus 2 so that is x minus 1 and p x minus 1 and we know p is N 0 minus x i by N 0 that is x minus 1 .	2.7520600322540796

So , I can rearrange it ; x i bring that here , x and z minus 1 N 0 x minus 1 .	2.6877801435318323

So , this gives the number of possible ways this i plus first chain gets introduced in the lattice when the lattice is already has i number of polymer chains present .	3.0602078484324076

So for simplicity what will be the i th chains , number of ways i th chains can be placed ; N 0 x i would be i plus 1 is i .	3.034097103147823

So , i would be i minus 1 .	5.369285903881271

So , this is the number of ways this i th chain i th polymer chain can be placed in the 3D lattice .	2.951879037942943

So , now if you want to calculate the number of ways all this chain can be placed ; we have to multiply by the possibilities of each individual chain .	4.483834860705969

So , the total number of ways the polymers can be placed in the 3D lattice will be given by w 1 w 2 w 3 w i N 2 .	3.26784983750169

Now , polymer chains in actual sense are these all segments are attached ; for a single polymer chain all the segments are attached .	3.269070780108293

So in true sense , the chances of finding a vacant cell near by a polymer chain would be lower than from a distance from a chain .	3.376209225830592

What I am trying to explain is that the chances of finding one vacant cell near the polymer chain would be lower than if you go little distance from a polymer chain because of segments are attached .	3.6335401306587802

But we are not considering that ; we are considering that whatever polymer segments are already present , they are distributed randomly .	3.653546787058949

So , we have found the number of distinguishable ways ; all the N 2 number of polymer molecules can be placed , w p would be because each .	3.7551733036855928

Again like the ideal solution , the arrangements between a single polymer chains are identical .	4.616590834351077

So , you have to divide by N 2 factorial by the total number of arrangements ; these are the total number of distinguishable arrangements .	4.0902627273371035

Now I am not going to go in detail about the steps ; this mathematical steps you can get or you can refer any of the standard text books , you will find out that different steps in between .	3.537276514228007

I am going directly to the final expression of this number of ways this total number of N 2 chains can be placed in this three lattice which is number of distinguishable ways you can place the N 2 number of molecules in this sheet ; it is given by the expression we just mentioned here .	3.581113479715935

Now we just drop the steps and write the final step .	3.856502158397723

So , this is the number way and all the polymers can be placed .	6.0616409595238805

Now once we had placed all the polymer molecules , now we can place the solvent molecules in the vacant cells .	4.59629528749419

Now how many different ways the solvent molecules can be placed in the vacant cells ?	4.382422060413627

All the solvent molecules are identical .	8.449910685907597

So , there is only one way you can place all the solvent molecules ; if you change the places between the solvent molecules themselves , it does not given any indistinguishable arrangement .	3.5674694091059407

So , this is the only one way you can place the solvent molecules .	4.815964257187409

So , the total number of ways you can place both the polymers and the solvent molecules and complete or fill the three lattice will be given by this multiplied by one which will be this .	3.759397000042772

So , w which is the total number of ways the entire 3D lattice containing N 1 solvent molecules and N 2 polymer molecules can be filled by this way .	3.3526506795438062

So , what will be the combinatorial entropy for this mixture ?	4.7012327331562425

So , this is what we get .	6.945720681111661

This S m is the combinatorial entropy for the mixture of N 1 solvent molecules and N 2 polymer molecules .	3.69482284342149

Now what will be the S accommodated interval for the solvent .	4.009354814532169

Again the number of ways you can arrange different solvent molecules is one .	4.337540387760712

So it will be k ln 1 , again 0 ; number of different ways you can add in this solvent molecules , but unlike the ideal solution case S 2 is not equals to 0 here because the amorphous polymer chain has different confirmations and so you can actually arrange the polymer chain in different ways ; not only one way like small molecules .	2.9934927131467193

So , S 2 which is the combinatorial entropy for the polymer molecule is one is not equals to 0 ; it has significant value .	4.87311876037288

So , what I will do ; I will continue I will just take this , do one more step mathematical step for simplification .	2.7261726023166464

S m by k is minus N 1 ; these are simple mathematical step , I am not explaining which you can do yourself .	3.5962068416270845

So , for pure polymer N 1 is 0 and for solvent N 2 is 0 .	3.5530172364105934

So , S 2 for the pure polymer we can get from this expression just by putting N 1 is 0 .	4.020778473340747

It should be N 2 x minus 1 and then z minus 1 e plus ln x .	3.1764210993676834

So , delta S m which is mixture minus S 1 minus S 2 would be given by minus k .	3.368484208187038

This is the term same term .	6.1443437375186845

So , it would be given by k ln N 1 N 1 plus x N 2 .	4.448361796937191

So , let us do it in the next page .	5.21027034619839

Now N 1 by N 1 plus x N 2 we can write this as phi 1 is the volume of fraction .	4.5345619164426685

This is the total number of segment , N 1 is the total number of molecules and we knew that the volume or size of a segment is same as the size of a solvent molecule .	3.6781178016742024

So , this would the mole volume of fraction of the solvent and this would be the volume fraction of the polymer .	4.495979375467172

So , we can write this N 1 ln phi 1 plus N 2 ln phi 2 or we can write this .	3.730892561286148

So , after all this exercise we got this entropy of mixing for the polymers ; for the polymers in a solution is give by this expression and this expression is same as the ideal solution of small molecules .	4.285391388661027

Because in case of ideal solution , we knew that phi i for ideal solution of small molecules phi i was equal to the mole fraction ; volume of fraction was equals to mole fraction .	3.202010506868462

So , you can replace by the mole fraction this number it gives the same number .	3.547098190866638

So , what is this expression ?	6.947912457281216

What we will do ; we will just come back in the next lecture and by now we understood that by Flory Huggins approach we can find out the entropy of mixing for a polymer and a solvent .	3.3447451345973978

So , we need to find out the delta h mixing or enthalpy of mixing for the polymer solvent so that we can get the free energy of mixing for the polymer solvent mixture So in next lecture , we will first get the enthalpy of mixing and then proceed from there to get the total Gibbs free energy of mixing for a polymer solvent system .	3.5070510641716726

We were talking about methods for immobilization of enzymes and in our earlier meeting discussed the first method called adsorption .	3.328745166382143

This method includes various combination of methods including physical adsorption , ionic binding and metal salt linkage .	2.494958341916955

It also involves involvement of a carrier matrix and sometimes these are known as carrier binding methods .	2.7577189257092045

The other methods that are known and available for immobilization of an enzyme are cross linking , covalent binding , entrapment within a matrix - it could be a gel , fibre or a microcapsule and finally the containment of soluble enzymes in the ultra filtration reactors and they are the whole variety of immobilization methods out of which we will be talking in a short while about the cross linking methods .	3.026790739973256

The cross linking methods involve intermolecular cross linking of enzyme molecules in the presence or absence of a solid support .	3.7046068385794118

I would like to make it very clear the phrase , “presence or absence of solid support. ” While initially the enzyme molecules are interlinked through a bifunctional reagent between some of the functional residues on the enzyme protein itself , the method produces a three dimensional cross linked enzyme aggregate .	2.8279374516992934

That means three or four or more enzyme molecules aggregate together through a covalent linkage mediated by a cross linking agent which is usually a multi - functional reagent and therefore the enzyme molecules form an aggregate that are insoluble in water .	2.6520277027912162

They retain the catalytic activity .	7.539242913453563

That means the intermolecular cross linking between the enzyme molecules should not involve the catalytic functional group that is required on the enzyme molecule .	3.378673091673966

A characteristics feature of this method is that ultimately when you get this material you end up in a gelatinous mass .	3.947664227539759

That means you don ’ t get a particulate matter .	3.7418496454213055

The enzyme molecule aggregates and comes out in the form of a precipitate , the gelatinous mass and when they are used in the enzyme reactors , they don ’ t offer a good flow property in the reactor and therefore they are not a very desirable kind of a material which can be processed in the enzyme reactor .	4.041206468970889

To overcome this very often they are used in the presence of a solid support .	4.526907668784505

When we talked about adsorption we mentioned that adsorption being a reversible process , the immobilized enzyme preparations that are produced by adsorption usually do not have very high or long operational stability .	3.3002361410082517

To enhance the stability of the adsorbed material very often adsorption is combined with cross linking so that the cross linking is carried out in the presence of an adsorbate , a matrix on which adsorption can take place .	3.09734765518704

Then the cross linking is carried out , so that you get a very stable immobilized enzyme preparation which also has the morphology of a particulate matter .	4.1784706008130135

If you recall the method of immobilizing enzymes by adsorption , one of the major drawbacks of the adsorbed enzymes is that they do not possess a very high operational stability .	3.5347443721095955

To over come this problem if the adsorption process is coupled with cross linking of the enzymes so that ultimately what happens is that each of the enzyme molecule present here is supported on a matrix and also cross linked to each other so that it forms a multi variant force by which the enzyme will not be a desorbed because it is now covalently linked to each other .	3.1213864204788253

The other advantage is that the disadvantage of the cross linked enzymes , that is the gelatinous morphology will also be removed because the cross linked preparation in the presence of the adsorbent will have the morphology of the carrier particle .	3.677524400642243

The adsorbent whatever we have used that morphology will be available and thereby one can get a much better preparation which can be used in reactor systems .	3.8710053420593997

One of the important things that we should recall is that these intermolecular cross linking requires certain very reactive reagents so that the functional groups of the enzyme can covalently bind under mild reaction conditions .	3.2508925864757168

Mild reaction conditions means , again I will I have to repeat , under those conditions in which the enzyme does not lose its confirmation or the functional reactivity .	2.8833695778226303

For those purpose we need certain reagents which are multifunctional and also very , very reactive .	2.917427575202425

Some of the typical reagents , although it ’ s not the complete list but some of the typical reagents which are commonly used are diazobenzidine , it has two functional groups and 1,5 – difluro – 2,4 – dinitrobenzene - two nitrate groups and fluro groups and trichloro - s - triazine and hexamethylene diisocyanate .	2.4648588204227604

The most commonly employed cross linking reagent over the years has been glutaraldehyde .	3.081276382745246

This reagent is very commonly used for all crosslinking experiments even routine as well as for practical .	3.9677293921210204

The glutaraldehyde is composed of two different reactions .	5.2511046919998075

When you store the glutaraldehyde solution , it is present in two different forms .	4.317809605631344

One as the free glutaraldehyde , a single glutaraldehyde molecule which contains two aldehyde groups separated by three –CH2 groups and it also occurs in the form of a dimer , in this form .	2.5347919155166334

The two forms are present in equilibrium .	6.180737247076015

It is available in this form as well in this form .	5.118047155839243

From the two forms it gives you two different kinds of cross linked enzyme preparation .	3.9375293277456977

While in the case of the first , the monomolecular gluteraldehyde residues , they give you cross linking reaction between the enzyme molecule particularly amino groups of the enzyme molecules are involved in cross linking and you get a chain of the enzyme protein which gets aggregated and gets precipitated .	4.043707513045158

On the other hand the dimer of the gluteraldehyde forms an addition conjugate along with the enzyme and it again gives you a precipitated mass and both the forms remain catalytically functional .	2.8024508735005917

So on storage the concentration of this dimer increases .	5.66015359330554

But the only difference will be that the reaction conditions that has to be employed , when I say reactions conditions , I am referring to the concentration of the gluteraldehyde , the ratio of gluteraldehyde to that of protein , the time of reaction and the temperature of reaction will vary in the case of two reactions .	4.209477663481303

Very often it happens that some standard conditions given in the book do not exactly replicate in a laboratory experiment mainly because if the gluteraldehyde solution available is of different age they would have under gone dimerisation .	2.3935173731906314

It will behave in a different way .	6.043129307382876

But both the products are crosslinked preparations and are useful .	3.890516189545866

The crosslinking method also must involve or identify certain optimum conditions for the crosslinking .	2.801276673184919

The optimum conditions depend upon the balance of parameters like concentration of the enzyme and cross linking reagent , pH , ionic strength , temperature and reaction time .	3.7432179443749356

Out of a large number of studies that has been carried out for cross linking particular for gluteraldehyde usually protein concentration of 50 to 200 mg / ml is the usual range in which we operate for crosslinking .	2.5121730881361928

The gluteraldehyde to protein ratio is also used at about 10 % weight by weight and gluteraldehyde concentration also varies over a large range from 0.2 to 0.6 % solution .	2.627204470708626

That means a very dilute solution of gluteraldehyde is required and at a ratio of about 1 : 10 .	3.844218247064881

That means 10 % of gluteraldehyde on the basis of protein content in the mixture and that is allowed to react for time period ranging from say about one to three hours to twenty four hours .	2.9431930424448676

This time period is dependent on temperature and the temperature requirement is linked directly with the stability of the enzyme .	3.756012508361569

Some of the enzymes which are fairly stable , thermally stable , they can be held at the room temperature and you can carry out the crosslinking say for example in one to two hours , where as certain other enzymes which are very sensitive to heat , they require to be reacted at 4ºC and then the reaction requires a time interval of at least twenty four hours .	2.8883815861189786

So all these parameters need to be optimized for a particular enzyme system to be able to get a gelatinous mass , which is crosslinked enzyme preparation .	3.9468246365223614

While cross linking may become a useful method in the laboratory in the form of the gelatinous mass for the practical reactor operation the gelatinous mass does not offer useful flow properties in the reactors for a continuous reactor .	2.6417198243893973

Therefore we usually use it along with the adsorption method .	5.311068935077227

That means we take an adsorbent , along with adsorbent or after adsorption is over we add gluteraldehyde to it and ensure crosslinking of the enzymes that are adsorbed in the matrix and the crosslinked preparation then provides you a good immobilized matrix for use in the reactors .	2.489625918044224

The other method and which has very large variety is based on the formation of covalent bonds between the enzyme and the support matrix under mild reaction conditions .	3.169551155970225

The term mild applies to the same feature and because we are talking about the formation of covalent bonds between the matrix and the enzyme molecule it brings in two major considerations .	3.5701559696590404

One is because of the covalent bond formation the immobilized enzyme preparation is very , very stable .	5.7870578068133725

Usually the covalently immobilized enzyme preparations will have a half life of few months when operated in a reactor and when stored under storage conditions it could go even for years without any loss of activity in terms of half life .	2.7672312900028397

But on the other hand because a covalent bond formation involves very reactive reagents for carrying out the reaction at room temperature or ambient conditions , it is bound to effect the confirmation of the enzyme protein .	3.3014896369422715

Although care need to be taken in covalent binding to ensure that the amino acid residues that are involved in the catalytic function are not involved in the covalent bond formation but still the reagents are not very specific .	3.524828601353925

If suppose we design an experiment to make a covalent binding with n terminal amino groups of the enzyme protein , but if the reagents will act on n terminal amino groups , it will be very difficult to ensure that none of the amino groups of the lysine are involved .	3.3964853396757295

If lysine happens to be an amino acid residue at the active site there will be significant loss of activity .	4.082588212110664

Almost 40 – 60 % loss of activity is a very common feature in covalently immobilized preparation .	4.71598150755763

The choice of the method will again depend upon the carrier cost and the chemicals involved in the immobilization method and one of the disadvantageous part is that usually the carriers here cannot be regenerated .	3.2217839878544714

The carrier cannot be regenerated .	6.2296569229826755

Therefore carrier cost becomes coupled with the cost of immobilization particularly in terms of chemicals it becomes quite high .	3.7430801174872044

So unless we want enzymes with a very high stability particularly when the enzyme cost is very high we don ’ t want to lose them during the reaction and such methods are not preferred .	3.25229603295788

Most of the chemistry of the covalent binding has been developed on the basis of the chemistry available for preparing the matrices for affinity chromatography .	2.7436888880894625

Because there also you couple a ligand on to a matrix by covalent binding to get a stable ligand bound matrix and almost similar chemistry because we have similar functional groups available here .	2.9597395885319537

It could be tertiary amino group of lysine or end terminal amino acid groups or a variety of other groups that are available on the enzyme protein .	3.4760618238456407

They could be , for example amino groups of lysine , terminal amino groups , thiol groups of cystein , carboxyl groups of aspartic or glutamic acid , carboxyl terminal groups , phenolic group of tyrosine , hydroxyl group of serine or threonine , it could be inert imidazole group of histidine .	2.090044005069809

The functional groups that are involved in the covalent binding are same as that involved in the preparation of matrix for affinity chromatography .	3.709064358130721

Almost similar functional groups on the ligands are used for making the matrices there .	4.74322731803453

So almost similar chemistry is applied excepting that in those cases ligand is a thermally stable molecule .	3.010954546703047

Methods available for choice is much broader compared to using enzymes where the stability of the enzymes become a key issue .	3.2608057733902

The covalent linkage is accomplished through functional groups that are not involved in the catalytic functions , a very standard prerequisite for any immobilization method .	2.841644270409506

That means for the availability of the different amino acid residues in the protein molecules and the number of reactions that are reported for each amino acids you notice that this the kind of sequence .	4.107174635242724

So that kind of a series is based on large number of methods which have been reported by people in the literature and also the average composition of protein .	4.08539365366173

This kind of a sequence is the observation which is followed .	4.427721973408939

If you look at some general principles of covalent coupling we can probably consider all covalent bond forming immobilized enzyme preparations on the basis of three classes of methods .	2.609358766515924

The A class refers to grafting of the enzyme to a pre - formed water insoluble functionalized polymer .	3.223004773682475

That means the polymeric matrix is already functionalized and has a reactive functional group which under ambient conditions can react with the functional group of the enzyme protein and give you the product .	3.6479012185809663

A typical reaction is shown here .	5.515234220982229

A matrix containing functional group X reacts with the functional group on the enzyme and the grafting takes place .	4.222177352272798

The enzyme gets grafted on to the matrix and some other molecule is released .	4.542986190319407

Another class of method is co - polymerization of an enzyme with the reactive monomers .	4.338299561946953

That means you don ’ t start with the functionalized polymer .	4.0448197296849395

You start with polymerization reaction starting with monomer and copolymerize in the presence of enzyme .	3.3766812880651482

That means some of the functional groups of the monomer and the enzyme have to be common so that in the polymeric network at some places instead of the monomer unit the enzyme is inserted and you get a polymeric mass which contains enzyme molecules distributed in the polymeric network in that kind of method .	3.7481617294713465

The third and very commonly employed method is via activation of the functionalized carrier .	3.095051665896315

You don ’ t take a preformed carrier but some carrier with some functional groups .	2.7731123035342593

Activate those functional groups by certain reagent and then the activated functional groups or activated matrix can react directly with the enzyme functional group to give you an immobilized preparation .	3.1934793390494987

Here a hydroxyl group containing matrix reacts with a bi - functional reagent .	3.5540126611160323

Both the X and Y could be aldehyde like in the glutaraldehyde .	4.104707855881367

X and Y could be different also .	6.8892257653835625

A variety of methods that are available in literature for covalent binding will fall into one of these three categories .	3.571495958475807

The interesting part is that if you look into literature probably during first part of the seventies a very large number of the reactions have been reported for immobilization of the enzymes on to polymeric matrices by covalent binding .	4.020349914482175

Not that all of them are industrially useful because sometimes you synthesize an immobilized enzyme preparation but the cost considerations or the other factors which we discussed earlier may not be so attractive industrially .	3.26533151319466

But still the technique is available and for some other application probably that method might become useful .	2.864994162666518

I will take a few examples to illustrate and the first and the simplest method is diazo binding .	3.521130044202185

Under acidic conditions you get a diazonium derivative .	6.378403508576271

This diazonium derivative is highly reactive and can react with number of amino acid residues that are present on the enzyme molecule .	3.8361822902920117

For example if you take this and react with a phenolic group of the enzyme molecule , it gives you a enzyme bound at the phenolic group .	4.058603798291647

Similarly it can also react with histidine group .	4.7098474733011315

It can also bind to histidine group and similarly give you an immobilized preparation with diazonium bond .	3.1468990380513406

No . Sorry this is N - Cl .	6.133454259836664

I think this is N NCl .	6.52214507261504

There is already N there .	6.058054433730885

Right . Diazonium derivative will have N triple bond N .	3.7792166116251753

Similarly it can also react with amino group of the lysine and give an immobilized enzyme preparation .	3.532326312339087

That is one method which is used very commonly particularly because of its versatility .	4.428560996682611

Only difference is the pH requirement in the three cases .	4.268741249656652

The pH requirement here is alkaline 8 - 9 .	5.212048033901117

In the case of histidine it is 5 - 6 and if you consider through amino group , the pH requirement is also 5 - 6 .	3.9079078218458507

Under control for pH conditions one can use different functional groups of the enzyme protein depending on the amino acid groups that are available at the active site to produce an immobilized enzyme preparation by azo binding methods .	3.775143607617584

A large number of methods for covalent coupling are based on peptide bond formation .	3.73614068142899

The same bond which is available in the protein molecules and a very simple reaction .	5.8951972165423

If you take an acid anhydride that can react with the amino group of the enzyme molecule and give you an immobilize preparation with –CONH - enzyme and - COOH .	3.6767631788539816

One of the typical factors here is that in addition to the enzyme binding a carboxylic group is also generated which means an additional charge , a free charge on the immobilized enzyme preparation and this negative charge gives sometimes undesirable properties to the preparation and sometime it can effect unfavorably the stability of the enzyme .	2.653667198020555

To overcome this disadvantage we usually neutralize some of the negatively charged species by addition of diamines .	3.4256164154902886

At the end of the reaction certain diamines are added so that this carboxylic group which is generated is neutralized and gets bound with the amino group and the preparation is neutral .	3.129417390809217

Electrostatic interaction it can bind if you have a negatively charged protein .	5.3903766944000076

But it cannot form the peptide bond under the mild reaction conditions at which we are talking it will be only feasible , if you have an acid anhydride group .	4.230324098111967

Take a carboxylic group containing matrix put into enzyme solution it won ’ t make a covalent bond because you need an activated matrix .	3.0374711210374215

This functional group has to be active or the reaction should be feasible under conditions which are mild in the sense that they are usually very close to the ambient conditions .	3.8036982987323658

Yes . You are right that this free carboxylic group will be available for adsorbing some proteins which are negatively charged and that ’ s why we try to remove this charge group so that it doesn ’ t interfere during the reaction .	2.8343898553225237

Another method for peptide bond formation which is very commonly employed is by the use of certain condensing reagents , usually the group of reagents defined as RNCNR ’ .	3.1521602308499106

These reagents can combine or they can activate the carboxylic group containing matrices to give , under acidic conditions , usually pH 4 - 5 , ortho acyl iso urea derivative .	2.380918531115617

That is –COOCNHRNHR ’ .	11.366861854077365

If it is reacted with the amino group of the enzyme at pH 4 - 5 you get a preparation CONH - enzyme .	4.461720573341857

Again a peptide bond is formed .	5.79683893211904

This is not a single reagent .	7.6431400813780375

These reagents which are commonly called as carbodimide are available in a whole range of these derivatives R and R ’ , which also makes its solubility properties .	2.80697233025431

Some of the reagents are soluble in aqueous medium , some are insoluble in aqueous medium and you require a non - aqueous or a more non - polar medium .	3.251643514732381

I would like to introduce you to another method involving the use of cyanogen bromide not only from the point of view of preparing the immobilized enzyme preparation but it also has an additional property that is the cyanogen bromide method is used in the case of carriers that have hydroxyl groups .	3.102696063701493

The typical example is cellulose .	6.895623698474817

If you react with the cyanogen bromide , you get an imino carbonic acid and this imino carbonic acid then can react with the amino group of the enzyme , at pH 8 - 9 under alkaline conditions , to give - CH - O - CONH - CHOH .	2.9534787861942324

Enzyme is coupled here .	8.46141693817527

One of the characteristic features of this reaction and for which it has been used and valued is that you can adjust the distance of the enzyme from the matrix what we often name as a spacer arm .	3.7313344430358506

We had yesterday also discussed that in the method of metal salt linkage by repeated use you can increase the distance of the enzyme molecule from the support matrix .	3.7871207700662617

You can use any length of the hydrocarbon chain .	5.01592156989436

So you get the hexamethylene diamine derivative of the cellulose where you have already separated the matrix by six CH2 groups .	3.2525627619812734

Therefore in most cases where the enzyme experience steric hindrances , this method can give you a preparation where by the steric hindrances are totally over come .	3.5794859153422562

After cyanogen bromide treatment , you get an imino carbonic acid .	3.83079595204075

Then you can react with amino group of the enzyme molecule .	5.232727912780089

Instead of amino group of enzyme molecule you react this material with hexamethylene diamine or any compound which has amino group as the functional group and a chain of methylene groups .	3.0065970663775103

So again the reaction will take place with the amino groups and the hydrocarbon chain will be inserted in between .	3.77086049386995

This amino group containing derivative can be used for immobilizing enzyme by any method which is applicable for amino group containing material .	3.6531879408489893

Therefore you can get immobilized enzyme preparation which is free of any steric hindrance .	5.176270327621832

But the choice of the method will depend on what enzyme we are trying to immobilize because we must know the functional groups that are involved in that enzyme molecule so that any method which is based on coupling of that particular functional group which is involved in the catalytic function must be avoided .	3.3981582171457907

The second thing we have to know is the stability of that enzyme so that the reactions that we are using must also not be carried under conditions under which the enzyme catalytic function is poor .	3.951217030582252

If the enzyme is more stable under alkaline pH , then we can take a method which is based on alkaline pH because if you find the whole range of method , you can get in the whole range of pH conditions , whole range of temperature conditions and temperature usually we do not go higher than ambient for all these kind of preparations and the immobilized enzyme preparations .	3.5016293783385177

One of the major advantages in the case of covalently bound enzymes is their stability .	3.7618147597694973

They can be used over a long period of time with very high operational stability but the cost of preparation usually is much higher than all other methods .	3.360924722729596

I think we will stop at this point today .	3.581667875535858

In the last lecture , we were discussing about different types of molecular weight of polymers , and we defined number average molecular weight , weight average molecular weight , z average molecular or z average molecular weight , whatever you call , viscosity average molecular weight .	3.262280931288201

And we also introduced the term polydispersity index , which was given by M w by M n .	3.152683772611844

Now , you may ask me , what is the need for having more than one molecular weight ?	4.025696593291172

We can just simply say that polymer , this polymer has , this polymer sample has this M n .	3.170268124744371

Now , let us , let us begin with some real life example .	3.6442869236038207

Now , I have ; so , for this class I have 50 students , 50 students on an average age , let us , 25 years , all of you .	2.8182449858765914

If I assume that your knowledge in polymer chemistry or other subject is related to the age , then you have some knowledge base .	3.30136675944425

Now , from these students , now I take out two student and add 2 , 10 year students ; we have age of 10 years , class standard 10 , student , 5 student .	2.1738175416557723

And , I take out 2 students and add 2 , 40 years , say , professors from any college .	2.8420574535477625

So , what will be the average ?	7.664741132904282

So , what do you think the samples ability to score in any subject , which depends upon knowledge , would change or not ?	2.539147931442517

The average remains same which is same as 25 years as earlier .	4.007593903000515

But , obviously , you can now understand that , because you added two 40 years professors , the ability to the knowledge or ability to score in exam is much more for this sample compared to the earlier one .	3.046820722124369

The average remains same , but the property ; in this case , property being the knowledge or the ability to score marks , changed .	3.429936054490111

That means property of a polymer sample cannot be always obtained from just single value of same end , which is the arithmetic or average , like this case .	3.043321820573613

If you have a distribution , broader distribution or a narrower distribution , then the property is going to change .	3.209079533162245

How do you determine this molecular weight ?	5.598593704219296

For example , if I have these colligative properties , you know colligative properties , properties ; these are like boiling point elevation of a solvent , freezing point depression , osmotic pressure , like this .	2.356693394751932

These , you know that the property or the value of this colligative properties will depend upon the number of solid molecules .	5.367216648984702

So , if you add a polymer sample in a solvent , make a solution , the boiling point elevation for that solvent compared to pure solvent or a freezing point depression compared to pure solvent .	2.898391407234422

We will now determine on the number of polymer molecules present in the solution ; number of polymer molecules , which will give you M n , because M n is what concerns the number of polymer molecules .	4.434907432735978

Now , if I want to measure the light scattering from a polymer solution ; as you know , the light scattering is dominated by the molecules having larger sizes or larger molecular weight .	3.9297271237658933

Alter centrifugation would depend upon M z .	5.632700738325036

Viscosity is depend upon M v , viscosity average molecular weight .	3.582636562381094

So , we need all these molecular weights as well as the distribution p d index , M w by M n , to completely under the sample ; what you mean by understand , the properties of the sample .	2.7461784951795245

If I want to know the ability to scatter a light from that sample , it would , you know , we need M w value , rather than M n .	3.181108384899557

And if you want to find out the colligative properties of that sample , then we know that this is M n which we need to know , rather than M w .	4.00861200274442

And also , we will see later lectures that distribution matters for a given average if distribution changes , then the properties like melt viscosity and the strength , and the mechanical properties also changes with the distribution .	2.8108914426484533

So , keeping the average same , the polymer property will change , if the distributions also change .	3.194836193621448

So , these are the reason , why we need all this numbers , or the values of all this molecular weights , not only a single molecular weight , and also the distribution .	3.52572012667467

Now , before I move to the , this lecture ’ s topic on temper polymerization , I just want to very briefly touch upon the thermo dynamics of polymerization .	2.648569425507965

Now , you know , del G is del H minus T del S .	3.989985178078128

When you making chain polymers , what you doing ?	4.257251719067188

We will making chain from the monomers .	5.52196874369672

So , lots of bond formation is taking place ; so , del H is highly negative , and because the monomers is getting tied up , del S is also negative .	3.247726243776072

So , depending upon the value of this del S and , del H and del S , the del G value will depend .	3.671517076088149

And , at normal temperature , the temperature we work in the lab , del H is highly negative which makes del G is based on 0 .	3.5298795016878928

So , the polymerization is highly favorable , same polymerization highly favorable .	4.243112282350578

So , minus T del S will become more positive ; which means , at some point , at a very high temperature del z , del z will be the 0 , and positive above certain temperature .	3.291773570403534

In that case , the reverse reaction would start taking place ; that means , polymers will start unzipping .	2.904670082075727

Because , in normal temperature , this reverse reaction is very insignificant for 10 polymers , but typically it do not represent , say , reaction like polyethylene formation with a reversible sign .	2.793498650999964

Because , the temperature , we do normal 10 polymerization , this reverse , reverse reaction is insignificant .	3.6437078937663196

Now , in case of step polymers , like we talked about PET , polyethylene teritarate , we have teritaric acid , so I have T A plus , ethylene , ethylene glycol plus , the dyol ethylene , dyol I write D A .	2.3928492259353584

Now , in this case , these reactions are reversible , and you have a associated equilibrium constant with this reaction .	4.164353868914085

Because , the re - activities of these accidents , accidental call , they form ester is , is not very highly , highly feasible reaction .	2.8411708527770236

So , often we need catalyst to make the reaction feasible .	4.335551691669849

This K would depend on reactivity of the function group as well as the temperature .	5.526530488038

Higher the temperature , the K will go up , and your reaction will go to its right hand side .	4.221549852242995

Now , in most cases , in most practical cases , to make a high molecular polymer , you have to take this condenser out , because this is a equilibrium reaction , reversible action .	4.346493881757144

In most practical cases , these are taken out by applying vacuum ; and also increasing temperature , by increasing temperature ; and doing that , you force the equilibrium move towards right hand side , which will gives you the polymer .	2.7118766794359384

Just to mention these two features that this step growth polymers are reversible equilibrium reaction , and having at a PET K value , which depend on the reactivity and temperature .	2.703781619533873

And , for a practical syntheses of step growth polymers , you need to take out this condensed from the reaction by applying high temperature and high vacuum , so that the reaction proceed to the product side .	4.05294645159241

Whereas , in case of chain polymers , it is feasible ; only at very high temperature the reverse reactions becomes significant .	3.6502828546461434

Just remember this point ; we will come to the detail turbulent polymerization when the proper time comes .	3.474606791944349

Now , we will move to the step growth polymerization and its kinetics and mechanism .	3.6807100252103018

Now , step growth polymerization can be classified in or grouped into types - one is , where you have polymerization done from single monomer having 2 different functional group ; so , I write A B gives you this ; for example , I can write , general reaction .	3.1525240056071717

And the second group is where you have , 2 different monomer having 2 different bifunctional monomer ; I can write a general example as in the earlier case , gives you ; plus , ok ; and , 2 n minus 1 , H 2 O .	3.2373486161828344

And , as we have learned in last lecture that to make a high molecular weight of this polymers , the polymerization has to be pushed with , such a way that to the conversion of the monomers or functional groups are very high , more than 98 person .	4.277980249001491

And , also we will see that another conditions required for this type of polymerization to make high molecular weight , is that the two functional groups has to be present , so , S symmetric amount ; that means , the ratio of NH 2 O group and COH groups has to be 1 isto 1 ; that is another requirement .	3.8112666762077585

We will find out more about that in , little later .	3.889528709293392

So , as we had seen in earlier lectures that ; we write this step wise reaction to describe a step growth polymers , or general you can write m r plus m r , gives you n plus m , m r .	2.899719087148808

So , in a polyestrification reaction , when you are forming a polyester form the higher C than diol , or form a hydro oxide acid , at any point of time , we will find , in the mixture dioxides and very different size of dioxides , diol and hydro oxides acid , and so on .	2.248629205378996

And , all this reactions happen between the functional groups ; so , polyester case , reaction between OH and COOH .	3.426926432473567

If we want find out rate of this polyester exhibition reaction or the step growth polymerization , you need to know the rates of each step , and then sum up to get the rate of the final polymerization .	4.001673268418574

But that is very difficult job ; is in practical to find out rate for individual because there is so many reactions happening , different possibility .	3.46098620027612

Then , if you want to know the reaction leads for each and individual steps and then finally , sum them to get the final rate ; that is practically a impossible task .	3.123316896153686

So , this is simplified ; it can be very simplified , if we imagine that rates of all this reactions are same .	3.7109972773923503

Now , this reaction is nothing but reaction between functional groups .	5.2602816409087225

Though the sizes of this species are different , but the final reaction is between OH group and COOH group for a polyester exhibition reaction .	2.8399355609651424

So , we can assume that the rates of this individual steps are different , and first it was proposed by Flory , and which is proposed as the equal reactivity of functional group , functional groups ; Flory , who proposed first .	2.8824353122322766

Now , what are the , what does it mean by equal reactivity of functional group ?	3.674350323628944

One : that reactivates of both functional groups in a bi functional monomers are same .	3.2603532038088696

For example , if we have a diol , or a di acid , or a hydro oxide acid , in case of the polyester is , reaction is just talking about ; re - activities of both the functional group 1n the bi functional monomers are same .	3.0229304922509486

Now , what is , the second point is that , the reactivity of one functional group is independent of the other function group present in the molecule ; which means , whether the other functional group is reacted or not , if we have bi functional molecule with 2 functional group two side ; now reactivity of one functional group is independent the other .	3.220625434812883

So , you can say that whether the other functional group , it present in other end of the molecule , whether that is reacted or not , that does not determine the reactivity of the other side , as the function group is in other side .	3.430829136084845

And second , it is independent of size of the molecule , or how for the two functional group are present ; whether they are present in the dimer , or in a octamer .	4.167854639766617

So , the functional , the reactivity of more the functional group is independent of the other functional group irrespective of the length in between , which makes this , all the reaction as happens in the step growth polymers , polymerization process , they are same .	3.8668957072549652

Now , this assumption is a shear assumption , and it has been proven experimentally .	3.9575223276923768

For example , this reaction ; Long back , by this 2 scientists , it was shown that this reaction , this esterification reaction becomes independent ; the rate of this in , esterification reaction becomes independent , when x is greater than equals to 3 ; which means , the reactivity of COH group is independent of the chain length .	3.15549679173457

And , not only this is true for mono functional agent , this reaction can be shown through , if you have the another COH in the other side .	3.6397404231850445

So , if you have a dicarboxylic acid and reaction it has already proved experiment , that if you have a di carboxylic acid , a reaction with ethyl alcohol , again the rate is independent of the chain length of the di acid group .	3.185149054158265

Another example , we can show , the other , the other example where .	4.260931366543939

Now , rate of this polyesterification reaction is again , it become independent on the value of x as well as the n .	4.058548692477294

These examples prove that the assumption we made earlier , in terms of equal reactivity of function group , is valid .	3.618360613014001

And that has been , it is not something here imagining to make our life simply , to my , make our life simplify .	3.113490114152815

This has been experimentally proven fact , that the reactivity of the equal , the functional groups are equal when in molecular species s present in a step polymers state .	3.46240640695374

Now , this can be justified , if you think little more .	5.087547382988745

For example , how the reaction takes place ?	5.316259558974676

In this case , between the two functional groups , between OH and CH for a esterification reaction ; the reaction takes place by the collision between the 2 functional group ; not all the collisions are useful ; not every collision between the OH group and COH gives you esterification .	2.7376088939998793

But fraction of collisions which can work on the activation minutes will give you a pester .	3.5581215336448224

So , as we know that the reactivity , for the finally , the outcome of the reaction , it depends upon the collision frequencies .	4.404163824603339

Now , when , this functional group present in a small molecule , compare a situation if you have the functional group , 2 functional group present in a regal molecules ; now , is under stood that regal molecules will have lower deficivity , they have lower deficient rate .	3.160349902176023

In this case , 2 oligomers having 2 function groups at the end , they will work if you compare with this smaller , smaller molecule .	3.100504496583645

But same times , same logic , when they come close , they will stay longer , because their rate of the fission is lower .	2.8011776912028066

And , if they stay longer , then the probability of collision between the functional groups which are present at the end also increases .	3.6897440431122286

So , the collision frequency between the functional groups also increases .	4.346191944661273

So , same time the collision frequency between the molecules coming down because of size being higher , but the collision frequency between the functional groups , they are becoming more .	2.867299792132589

So , on effect , this two are rarifying each other , and so , final collision frequencies between the functional groups present in a smaller chain compared to a larger chain are equal ; and , as the collision frequency , the final functional groups are equal , the reactivity or the rate of reactions also equal .	3.0130186671084744

So , now we will move to the ; with that example , I will go to the kinetics of step growth polymers .	4.2416970300621015

And , before we start kinetics of step group polymers , we define another term , or we talk about Carother equation , which gives you the average degree of polymerization ; sometimes written as DP , is a average of polymer , degrees of polymerization .	2.7949795707525893

Now , what is degrees of polymers ?	5.914412001069447

We learned in the first lecture , is the number of structure units present in the molecule or in a polymer chain .	5.8124800425219645

Let us talk about stirring .	7.425015568724929

And , in this case , this is a repeating unit ; it is same as a structure unit , structure unit is the residue of the monomer .	4.025654185911636

So , in this case , repeating unit , or number of repeating unit is same as number of structure units ; molecular weight of repeat unit is same as molecular of structure units .	3.7678461703636947

In case , polyethylene teritarate , this is the repeat unit .	5.528610951395128

So , what is the relation between repeat unit and structure unit , in this case ; and each repeating unit contains 2 structure units .	3.394420380728665

So , the molecular of repeat unit is the average of the structure units minus , the conducted which had gone out , in this case water molecules , because of the condensation reaction .	3.6072466402104686

See , this is specific case as a polyethylene , this is structure units , and repeat unit is this .	3.1709570919990484

So , in this case , molecular of structure unit is twice the molecular of repeat unit ; this is the repeat unit , and this is the structure unit .	4.483392508226793

So , the molecular of structure units twice the molecular repeating .	4.297857285391294

So , this is a specific case , this , this example is not , there are many many case .	4.257661606180215

So , they , this two are more common , where the molecular of repeat unit is same as structure units ; where , second case where molecular structure unit is the summation of the average server .	2.843647529530556

So , basically we had to put twice ; average multiplied by twice for this .	2.7760111807465515

So , the X n is the average number of structure units per molecule .	5.336302500271375

Now , this can be given by N 0 by N ; if N 0 is the total number of monomers at the beginning , and N is the total number of chains present at after polymerization or some time .	3.7009580276231158

How do you get ?	10.194119438167238

You just simply think that , say if you have 50 of your students , I ask to occupy 5 benches .	3.340194291251218

Now , they are big benches ; we can occupy any chairs if you choice ; so , all 50 of you distributed in the 5 benches .	2.5115916221367804

Now , at the end I ask you to hold hand and tell me , what is the average , average number of student in a particular bench ?	3.6949375632639048

So , you have total number of 50 students , in the 5 bench .	4.288279529452054

So , average per bench is 50 by 5 , that is 10 .	4.03302703050289

Simply , if you are starting with N 0 of monomers and then finally , you have present , you are remain with N mono N chains , then each chain will have N 0 by N structure units ; simple .	2.848240130498092

Now , N 0 was the number of molecules , or monomers at the beginning .	4.947479379807323

And , now , N is the monomers present .	6.7132863666919365

So , N 0 minus N is the number of monomer or moles of monomers reacted , divided by , N 0 is the total number of monomers the beginning , and each monomer has 2 functional group .	3.5784327456272296

So , multiplied by 2 functional group , 2 each to make the total functional group reacted .	3.81579324486895

So , this is the number of molecules present at this , at this movement , any time during the reaction .	3.255871084659811

So , N 0 minus N is the monomers which are reacted .	5.366297346950826

So , you multiplied by 2 to get the number of moles of functional groups reacted , and N 0 was the monomers were present originally .	3.658984024838649

So , N 0 by 2 is the number of functional group present at the beginning .	5.007743200940569

So , this is the fraction which has reacted .	5.324856988301044

So , I write N 0 by N , N 0 ; I can rearrange this to get N 0 by N as 1 by 1 minus p .	3.2233337047167603

So , if you compare this and this , I can write , the average degree of polymerization is given by 1 by 1 minus p .	4.7064226097468245

Now , this is again giving the same information as we got in earlier cases , in earlier discussion .	3.2133517852873945

To have a high molecular weight polymer you need to have high value of X n , is the number one monomer unit or structure unit present in the system .	3.858487573032458

How do you get a high value of X n ?	6.14187022005684

Only the p is high ; if it is p is 0.98 , may be 90 percent of the function groups has reacted , you get 50 ; X n is 50 .	3.561178155770565

If it is 0.99 , there will be 99 percent of the functional groups are reacted , then you get 100 .	5.591210746183314

So , look , how it is from 99 , from 98 percent reaction to 99 percent reaction , you are getting jumping degree of , average degree of polymerization from 50 to 100 .	3.168734435354819

If 90 percent of the fractional groups are reactive , when normal organic reaction is in small molecules ; say , we have an esterification reaction , a 90 percent reaction means , you all happy ; if you not happy you increase , do something to make a 95 percent reaction , then very happy .	2.4518668241950157

Whereas , in case of polymers , if you do 90 percent , in step growth polymers we have a 90 percent conversion ; p is 0.9 , then this gives you 10 ; X n is 10 .	4.690368046653999

So , it is a oligomer .	8.98675250772888

So , 90 percent conversion is not enough to give you high molecular polymer .	4.880644333332484

So , again stating it for getting high molecular polymer , you made a conversion p greater than 0.98 and so ; 0.98 give you 50 and so , as increase will be p , the higher and higher value of X n .	2.4916552672715757

How do you get molecular x from , you got X n average degrees of polymers from this ; you can get experimentally , p , q , can experimentally determine the fraction of molecule present .	3.197013067047432

So , if you do it activation for curio oxide acid , you can get the fraction of from beginning .	4.026015659791467

So , you can get X n multiplied by the molecular unit of structural unit , plus , the molecular unit of , molecular unit of the groups of the end .	3.7649580494790107

So , if I take a example of adipic acid , plus ethylene glycol , you get a polymer of this .	3.770581353859569

So , molecular weight of the repeating unit in this case , this is the repeating unit , is the molecular weight of this entire repeat unit , which is 172 .	5.14367693738246

But , molecular weight of average molecular of the structure unit in this case , we have 2 structure units in this unit .	4.616220859631591

So , the molecular weight of structure unit ; in this case average , because 2 are different .	4.90909621145585

So , I can write M s u average is 172 by 2 , is 86 .	3.464925807473737

So , and what is the molecular weight of the n group ?	5.948332216388389

OH plus H , it gives you 18 .	7.762380785202638

So , the total unit of this polymer would be given by X n bar multiplied by 86 plus 18 .	4.225126158267281

So , this is , this is very important part .	8.47263451468906

Now , the molecule , relation between molecular weight and degrees of polymers ; Molecular weight , M n , is degrees of polymer multiplied by the molecular rate of the structure units .	3.8716990610033957

If the polymer is made from 2 different monomers , like in this case adipic acid and its glycol , then molecular of structure will give the average of that , of that .	3.760176612423844

Some people , or some students in , from our experience , you have seen that they confused this with the repeat unit ; then they were confused that this is a molecular repeat unit , this is molecular rate of the structure unit .	3.2334155865705205

So , this is 86 not 172 for this example .	5.674868446796385

And , in more of an , in all practical cases , we can ignore this contribution from n group .	3.203815783362468

So , most often we write , M n is this .	5.736278996769912

Now again , this is molecular of structure units , if this is , this is synthesis from two different monomer in this case adipic acid and ethylene glycol .	4.284235993564422

This is average of the residues of the monomer ; the monomer minus the condensed , in this case H 2 O .	4.228735390339548

And , average of that , so , this is 86 ; not the molecular rate or the repeating rate .	6.185189731334379

If you take repeat unit , you will be doubling the calculated molecular weight M n for this .	3.201158983263628

Now , let us come back to the kinetics of step growth polymers .	4.239037465631498

Now , just to illustrate the general poly esterification ; we will take a example of poly esterification as the example of step growth polymers .	3.614213911451757

And , we take as earlier , di oxide plus diol gives you polyester .	2.8442748937483984

And , as I said that , in most cases for practical purposes , you need a catalyst to increase the reaction rate .	4.0196427506202355

So , I can write this X n reaction for this H A represents the acid .	3.27348217581935

This is the reaction scheme for a polyestrification process .	4.576736075195948

And this waved lines means that it is applicable for any size ; no , we are talking about general reaction , it could be a end of the dimmer or in dimmer and so on .	3.3629281665357174

And so , as this , the hydro oxide group ; remember , we talked about the equal reactivity of functional groups ; so , we are considering all this functional group present at the end of a molecules are equal .	3.6602863647480786

So , we consider this general reaction .	6.023117889595764

So , that this reactions are all most exclusively on the right hand side .	3.3246514212790386

So , the k 5 , k 6 and k 4 are very small ; k 6 , value of k 6 and k 4 are insignificant ; we can ignore them , because in most practical scenario , we take out this 2 from the system to make reaction move towards right hand side .	2.9515668307857843

Now , we will come back to the cases where you cannot take out the entire amount of H 2 O produced ; we will talk about the expression for those cases later .	3.537691474643401

For this case we are ignoring this 2 , and so that the value of k 6 and k 4 are very in significant .	4.908960478351475

And , also this k 3 is the ; the value of k 1 , k 2 and k 5 , they have much higher value compared to k 3 .	4.330339221551263

So , this reaction is your state , rate determining in state , which is given by the rate constant value of k 3 .	4.601609669615674

So , if I want a write a rate expression , rate of polymerization R p will be given by loss of acid group from the reaction ; this is , we talked about this reaction .	3.90916504318431

So , from this reaction you are getting the , this is 1 .	7.002783361233423

So , the rate of reaction is given by k 3 and the concentration product of this 1 , and which 1 is this ; number 1 is this .	5.443952661572387

Now , from the first reaction , this one , we can write a equilibrium constant k 1 by k 2 , is this 1 by concentration of COOH and HA ; from this reaction , we can write equilibrium constant is this ; concentration of this , divided by the concentration of this , and concentration of that .	3.94596036145543

So , I can , from this expression I can put the concentration I value to this expression , to get R p minus d COCH by d t , gives us k 3 K COOH HA and OH .	2.551962713663328

I can write this as another constant OH .	6.408275857042683

Now , we can consider two specific cases , where you have self catalyst ; that means , you are not adding external catalyst , excess catalyst from outside ; H is not , as said outside ; the COOH groups present in the medium are acting as a catalyst ; in that case , you can write this as K COOH square and concentration of OH .	3.340067265924215

Now , as you now that , most cases the reaction is carried out with the isometric amount of COOH and OH .	3.578358455945592

So , you can replace OH by COOH concentration , which gives you this ; and I write this as K M cube to make it simplified .	3.4767044457010354

So , M is concentration of either COOH or OH in this case , because both are used in isometric amount .	3.6960181207363316

So , I quickly integrate this expression , d CoOH by d t is k M cube ; minus , this we can put M ; minus M by M cube is k d t .	2.541061916330842

I integrate from , at t is equal to 0 , M is M 0 , and at t is t , M is M , which leads you , minus , this minus here ; minus of minus half 1 by M square , minus 1 by M 0 square is k t ; or , 1 by M square , 1 by M 0 square is twice k t .	2.6199169026284306

Now , again , from definition of a conversion , we can write that amount of monomer present is , the amount of monomer present initially at t is equal to 0 , minus conversion which makes this ; and I am going little fast , but you can yourself go through it and understand no problem .	3.1424826201628906

So , from this , I can now write ; or , X n square , k t .	3.602285107094891

Now , you can do yourself for an external catalyst reaction .	4.5393289500041965

We had the original rate equation R p is , d t is , k 3 k COOH HA and OH .	3.186325318768522

Now , if this is added from externally ; the concentration of this is 6 .	5.5507344707100845

So , with this and this , you can take this ; a new constant ; put this .	5.182361372992059

So , if this makes you , again COOH square .	3.7093926093214873

I can write , similarly , d M M square is t .	4.86185177274022

Similarly , integrate form M 0 to M , t is equal to 0 to t ; and you finally get , 1 by M minus 1 by M 0 we get as t , which will lead to 1 minus 1 by p minus 1 t ; or , X n is 1 plus M 0 k dash t .	2.6505742473298173

Now this was for self catalyst , and this expression for external catalyst .	4.539789295253144

See , if you can , you going to plot time with molecular width , in this case , for a external catalyst you get a straight line for X n by verses t plot ; and in case of self catalyst you get , square verses t as a plot .	3.161913829891857

As you can find out from this , to increase , if you increase the time , it is always , you get more increase in the molecular weight , when this is external catalyst .	4.3040818559872065

This was for external catalyst , this was self catalyst .	3.969665610418564

If you increase the time 4 times , the molecular weight also increases 4 times , in case of external catalyst .	4.7959741537424385

But if you increase the time 4 times , you are only double increasing molecular weight for a same catalyst reaction .	3.507265474323878

That is a reason , it is always very difficult to get a poly conversion reaction by a self catalyst reaction , we always add , we always , typically in practice , we always add catalyst from outside .	2.9813839956686126

Now , what we will do in next lecture is , we will take this , this two expression , and start from there in the next lecture .	3.3759669968181036

And we will talk about this plots , little more ; and , how , what does it signify .	3.5775388352052797

And we will talk about the other aspects of step growth polymerization in next lecture .	4.014559726222824

We will continue this step growth polymerization in the next lecture .	4.918531581185121

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

And we planned to just complete the discussion , we were having on phase separation behavior of polymer solutions .	3.2232958809248538

And then in chain dimensions , we will talk about size and shape of polymer chains , and take different chains , freely rotating chains , chains with bond angle and short range restrictions .	2.9455206358313206

And then finally , with long range steric interaction and excluded volume .	3.6572540197769308

Now , let us just complete the discussion , we are having in the last lecture , you know , from Flory Huggins equation , we have seen this is a , this is the Flory Huggins expression and then we converted to Gibbs free energy of mixing per segment in the last lecture , and which was turned out to be this .	3.5447555141931146

We can , we will find this type of general , this type of general curve .	4.6898409377725425

These are corresponding to different temperature .	5.445670768335981

And we discussed that there could be one type where the polymer is soluble in the solvent at any composition , and then there could be another type where you have in left hand side and in this side , you have complete solubility , and you have a region where you have metastability , thermo dynamically unstable , but metastable for small fluctuation in composition , and then you have a completely insoluble region or unstable region .	3.466124231805799

Now , these are the points to minima , who have the , which has the , which have the common tangent , they are called binodal points or bimodal composition , and the inflection point which is the boundary between metastable unstable region .	2.9377939887309585

They are called spinodal points .	5.800161852367771

These are called binodal and these are called spinodal points .	4.447859578374004

And now , you can see that this both the binodal points as well as the spinodal points , they are actually temperature dependent .	4.226404394464782

If you change the temperature of your polymer solvent mixture , they are , they will change .	4.713578941075359

So , these are the possible different temperature where T 6 is the highest and T 2 greater than T 1 and so on .	2.790168335639412

Now , what we are going to do , we are going to plot this binodal and spinodal points with respect to temperature .	3.936909780962327

So , if you have t , there are T 1 .	4.43656387257788

So , this T 1 you have two binodal points and two spinodal points .	3.765062276480287

So finally , you will get these , you get these points .	5.391850474488845

Now , you join them , you join to get a line for the binodal points and a line for the spinodal points .	3.0924335072783427

So , if I want to join them at different temperature , I will get a line for the binodal points .	3.1905491779314343

This is for binodal and then similarly , I get line for the spinodal points which will coincidence or converge in a same temperature , which we call T c , critical temperature and the corresponding composition here is phi 2 c which we discussed in last lecture , here .	2.6219918981364305

So , you get this is specifically a plot of polymer phases with temperature changing and with different composition .	3.0031987009702235

So , If I , this is the region where this is unstable or two phase system , this is a metastable system which is thermodynamically unstable , but metastable and this outside is completely stable .	3.3319507734990403

Now , if you start see , if you start from here , a point from here , a composition from here corresponding to this corresponding here .	3.2523618008251174

So , if you start a point here ; obviously , this is a single phase system soluble , and then if you cool the temperature , what will happen ?	3.8242110551291617

At this temperature , they will start precipitating .	5.58046941765463

So , they will start forming two phase system , because this is that is metastable , thermodynamically unstable ; similarly , if you start from this temperature , this point , this composition then they will start precipitating this temperature .	3.2585112137141077

So , if you change the composition ; obviously , the temperature at which the two phase or the precipitation starts will vary .	3.005093066049444

So , basically this temperature is called upper critical solution temperature and that happens , because if you remember our excess chemical potential term .	2.9877320107806993

Now , both these term excess term also dependent on the temperature as well , and you can also express in terms of polymer solvent interaction parameter and finally , with entropy parameter .	3.8143699745205137

Now , chi which is polymer solvent interaction parameter also temperature dependent .	4.0081119789939175

Now , most cases , most of the polymers , this entropic term is negative ; most of the , in case most of the polymers , as we have seen earlier this entropic term is positive .	4.406862926073951

So , if .	23.92183402878429

So , at some temperature which is higher than theta temperature , this excess term will become positive and you will start getting precipitation .	3.435789507905769

So , these are the corresponding temperature and in those system , you will get a upper critical solution temperature .	3.4761268293039715

Now , in some polymer system which are not very frequently observed , you get this type of behavior which is a lower critical solution temperature , where the entropic term entropic term is negative .	3.7562136596828495

One example , very common nowadays used in research is polyanisopropylaclamide .	3.275453978646245

Now , this polymer , polyanisopropylaclamide , this is has a hydrophobic group .	3.7843435272966195

Now , if you dissolve this polymer in water , what happened ?	3.3933208208844756

These two groups participate in hydrogen bonding with water , but because this is hydrophobic group to hide this hydrophobic groups from water , the waters form , water molecules form structured around this hydrophobic group which we call hydrophobic hydration or cage formation and results , you get a negative entropy .	2.2214425541303213

The entropy actually comes down because of structuring of the water molecules this hydrophobic groups .	3.669805382502482

Now , in addition to the combinatorial groups , which is always favorable , favorable in mixing process ; in this case , this entropy , because of contact between the polymer and the solvent , which is opposing the mixing process .	3.36996953826998

So , in this case , the entropic parameter is negative .	4.52418537540215

So , psi is negative .	8.60354988891021

So , what happened ?	8.930903357340439

Then unless you have the temperature lower than theta , you will not get the solution .	4.920827413549531

So , what happens ?	8.646089926521524

As you go down in temperature , you get from insoluble system to soluble system , and when that the particular temperature , when that happens for all composition , we call that temperature l c s t .	2.538084348953339

L c s t can be observed for this two cases as well , where we have psi parameter negative ; another polymer is polyehtyleneglycol , you can have l c s t because you have a strong interaction between the polymer and the solvent .	3.0425079120372835

Now , what we have seen in last lecture that if you , this spinodal binodal points , for this binodal points , this , you have still first derivative 0 , for spinodal points you have second derivative 0 , and for the critical point spinodal curve and the binodal curve merges , the third derivative is also 0 , and if you just use that formula that gives free energy , this formula and differentiate with phi two , then you will get these expressions .	2.5649887203438704

Now , if you know the dependence of chi with temperature then you can find out the spinodal points ; and the critical points is given by this expression .	3.816684809255324

And if you can combine these two , you can get the critical entropy , the polymer solvent interaction parameter by this expression .	4.185342794821286

So , let me write it again .	6.364245719834008

So , critical composition at which the polymer started , starts a separating out from solution is given by 1 by 1 plus x , x is the number of segments , chain segments which is always very high , x is always much , much greater than 1 .	2.897444921175875

So , you can write 1 by x .	7.141137651498984

So , the critical concentration at which the phase separation first appears going from a two phase region , from one phase region in to two phase region is thus predicted to occur at low polymer concentration , if we have say polymer having a polymer weight of 1 million 10 to the power 6 gram per mole , and then if you have the repeating this molecule to this is hundred , this is the molecular weight , then x would be close to 10 to the power 4 close to ten to the power 4 , then phi 2 c would be 0.01 .	2.888939534029802

So , basically if you have very high molecular weight then the concentration at which the polymer starts from going , from becoming one phase system to two phase system is very low , if your polymer molecular comes down then this goes to little higher concentration .	3.0270463717265814

Now you also know , second , this is , this shows that the critical composition at which the polymer becomes one phase system to the two phase system is highly dependent on the molecular weight because this is also proportional to molecular weight .	3.8645138808959194

So , you can molecular weight to the power half .	4.013373986733454

So , as the molecular increases , this goes to lower and lower composition .	3.9521325854086093

Now you can .	12.509134600284483

So , this , you can also write from our previous knowledge that this is the enthalpy parameter , this is the entropic parameter and theta is kappa T psi .	4.356328820900696

So , we can write minus psi 1 by theta by T half minus chi .	3.08055051886123

We can set T is equal to T c and theta is equal to theta c at T is equal to T c chi is equal to chi c , we can write from this , minus psi 1 minus theta T c to half minus chi c .	3.228339536697566

Chi c , we have only the got from last expression .	4.167696978801547

So , that is half , minus half , just one minute , this is chi minus half .	2.7168675027031193

Let me do it again , its just some confusion , let us just do it again .	3.091117701576583

So kappa minus psi , we know .	5.173533922482464

So , minus… These are the expressions we know .	5.887663185002325

Now from there , we can write 1 by T c ; for large x , we can write one by T c is one by theta one plus b b is b 1 .	3.317313951649385

This v bar is specific volume of polymer and v 1 is molar volume of solvent , then we can write the number of segments like this ; and we define the term b as this .	3.8875832495353437

So , we can write this .	5.695005726051956

So , which means that one by T c is proportional to M to the power half ; that means , the critical temperature is again like the critical composition in this , critical temperature also varies with the molecular weight .	3.53748730889964

So , if your molecular weight goes up then your critical temperature also will go down .	4.256891727919477

We have seen earlier that your molecular goes up , critical composition also goes down .	3.2601282332080634

And in this case , we are seeing that the molecular goes up then critical temperature also comes down .	3.880535237308274

So , we can plot these two .	6.313026167215649

You can see what we have observed , this is experimental curve for observed for solutions having polymer and solvents having upper critical solution temperature .	2.4213915754141864

So , as the temperature goes up , this is temperature , as the temperature goes up the critical temperature also goes down and the critical composition at which the phase separation take place , they also become lower , lower ; this is experiment cup which we just seen from theoretical calculation that if the temperature goes up both T c goes up and the phi 2 comes down .	2.9056778346013323

Now , these expression is also throws up one more interesting conclusion that if say molecular rate is very high close to infinity then 1 by T c would be equals to theta or theta would be equals to T c .	2.7658896893969005

If M is close to infinity or m tends to infinity or T c is equals to theta , which means that critical miscibility temperature , theta is your critical miscibility temperature in the limit of infinite molecular weight .	3.031056901090575

So , that is another observation we can make from this expression .	4.540517023231221

So now , we completed our discussion on the polymers solutions and in phase separation .	3.5848744060696442

Now , what we now , we will shift to the new another topic which is chain dimensions .	3.609722118599563

What we happened in typically , how do you write polymer ?	4.548258703914951

When you have seen in the books , you have seen me always writing polymers like this , something like this , we never write polymers like this , we never write polymers like this , we always write whenever represent polymer , we write a quily chain .	2.5045310850392104

Now , that is because that that because the polymers are long chain and you have there is a numerous possible confirmations , because you have a rotational freedom across the backbone and if the polymer chain rotates across the backbone , obviously you will get different chains different confirmations and the backbones are quite flexible in case of polymers .	3.5425992018223815

So , that is the reason you get this type of confirmation most of the times .	5.005080077724172

This is a , let us consider a simple polyethylene molecule .	4.85504444609065

This is the chemical expression .	8.36478733917046

Now , this does not capture the numerous confirmations a polymer chain exists .	3.775524429018276

Now , as I said that the existence of the , these numerous confirmation results from the rotational degree of freedom that a single bond allows .	2.6302559691463676

You can , depending up on the substitution , the rotational , the rotation across the single bond always allowed Now , if you have so many bonds in case of , so many single bonds .	3.440937946249665

So , polymer , polymer polyethylene you have so many single bonds .	3.602717252296489

Now , each you can rotate , they are rotatable .	4.1720720758967165

So , that is the result you get , so many , so many confirmations .	3.7446391119899145

Now , as you have this so many confirmations , the size and shape of the polymer molecule will depends on ; obviously , the chain length , now as the chain length goes up , you expect the size also go up ; obviously , .	3.4400639435303515

Secondly , it depends up on the chemical structure or chain stiffness .	5.6752533573468185

Now , if you have say polyethylene molecule or say polystyrene molecule ; obviously , the rotation , the rotational freedom across the single bond will be much lower in case of polyethylene than polystyrene , because of bulky substituent , the rotation across the single bond will be restricted in case of… So , polystyrene is a stiffer chain , we will say that this is the most stiffer chain than the polyethylene , or in other words , polyethylene is a more flexible chain than polystyrene ; but still , in spite of being this phenyl in side group , it is still , it is also having significant freedom across the single bond , rotational freedom across the single bond .	2.603008715132518

So , it will also be a , but the degree of may be lower than most flexible chain like polyethylene .	3.649322457900681

So , if the third one is of course the molecular involvement which depends up on where the polymer is if the polymer is in a solvent then obviously , if the interaction between polymer and solvent is higher than or main interaction between solvent - solvent and polymer - polymer , then the polymer solvent interaction will be preferred .	3.5008451710202784

So , the polymer will try to expand its chain .	5.690703645558508

So , bigger in size and if the polymer solvent interaction is lower compared to the main interaction of polymer - polymer and solvent - solvent , then it will try to contract and avoid the solvent molecules .	4.017684431000148

Now , if you , if the polymer present in a concentrated solution then one polymer will come close to another polymer molecules .	3.4357212659407965

So , that will in effect not allow polymer to expand .	3.691437460579092

So , they will again try to contract .	4.921215789719119

So , these are the factors where the polymer is in dilute solution or concentrate solution , this is a good solvent or poor solvent or theta solvent that will dictate the size and shape of the molecules polymer molecule .	3.3121788251041284

Now , let us talk about shape first .	4.146409947378107

We are using the terms size and shape .	5.053771455011066

What do we mean by shape ?	5.6260485954795945

As we mentioned in most cases , we write polymer chains like this or something like this , never we write this , because polymer chains as we have seen , they are having single bond where rotation occurs in bond are possible .	3.1037617131188444

So , you get a flexible a chain and in most cases we highly coiled these are coiled structure .	3.5530567012672853

Now , if the stiffness goes up , if you make more stiff , the coiling , the flexibility comes down , coiling will not be possible .	3.1112211295944316

So , if the , if the say this is like a coiled structure , if the stiffness goes up , it may be like something like a worm like , because it is not so flexible to become a coil ; and if the chain becomes , even more steep then finally , it will be like a rod .	3.216920023704914

So , this is stiffness goes up , stiffness of the backbone goes up ; most polymers , we will deal in this class and we come across in application , they are falling in this category where the polymer is enough flexible to reclose to a random coil than a worm like than a rod like .	2.451266372091107

So , the confirmation the confirmation of a flexible chain looks like random flights of division of particles , when particle say , gas particle diffuse then what happens ?	2.216916147440374

Moves here randomly , random fly , random flight .	4.163361183171256

Now , polymer segments or polymer bonds cannot be so random because you have restriction of this lengths , each gas molecules can move like this .	2.5371936533974857

So , it can take any steps wherever it wants , any direction , but in case of polymer molecule , states are fixed as the bond length of the , each of the bond length of the backbone , repeating unit ; and there are restriction of each bond angle , and there are restriction of also in rotational , we will come and talk about those in details ; what I am telling it is , in case of polymer also , it takes the segment takes random flight , random walk , but not as freely as a gas molecules do in case of diffusion ; because it takes random walk or random flight , we call this the confirmations of flexible polymer in solution are in melt as random coils or Gaussian coil .	2.6850876262527574

Now , let us talk about size .	4.458887276710973

We have talked about shape , it could be random like , worm like looks , like rod like and most cases , we deal with their enough flexible to become closer to a random coil .	2.857734468994682

So , we will deal , we will discuss only about random coil , not about the other two confirmations of polymer molecules .	3.4004153691302204

Now , let us talk about size .	4.458887276710973

What is size ?	11.749879128711298

When you write a polymer chain like this , as we saying all the time , we write polymer chains like this .	3.779956130559426

Now , what we , what do you mean by size ?	4.826887345652654

Of course , one of the basic size is contour length , contour length is basically n multiplied by l , n is the number of bonds and l is the , n is the number of bonds and l is the length of each bonds .	2.9333517953881083

So , basically of , you arrange all the bonds one after one , all the bonds , the length will give you the contour length .	3.264952740261126

Now , which is in practical , in a polymer chain or any chemical chain will not be , will not have this type of arrangement .	5.391336461587743

So , this is just theoretical number .	5.800926183544973

So , as the maximum theoretically possible length one polymer can have , if just put all the bonds , all bonds in straight line one after one .	2.5040111993113516

Now , we said this the polymers behave like this in random coil .	3.507507682251545

So , another dimension we can have , it is like end to end distance say , if this is one end and this is another end , where we have r , we call end to end distance .	3.8902659112640574

Now , is this polymer confirmation is fixed ?	4.940071076398681

No , it is not fixed because there are continuous rotation across the single bond .	3.8965883418282616

So , you may have one now and immediately after next moment you may have these are apart , or next moment you can have something like this , where we insert like this .	2.878530687304281

So , as the polymer confirmation is changing all the time , you cannot have a fixed value of end to end distance , because this might have some value which is defined from this value , which is defined from this value .	3.0395686372767217

So , what we do statistically , we find probability of finding one length , how much and then use this term where this represent time average .	2.551515916801235

So , you with time , what is the average ?	8.143552512589606

r square to the power half .	6.659976718568553

So , this because the polymer change is always changing with confirmation , you cannot write a fixed r , you have to write statistical parameter which is given by a root mean square end to end distance .	2.910581989757189

Now the third parameter which we can mention is like a radius of gyration .	4.61763720637968

This radius of gyration is defined as the root mean square of distance of the elements of chain from center of gravity of the coil .	2.9177259788171317

So , these are the distance of all the segments , all the elements , numerous numbers .	4.266263792803828

So , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .	110.49575182145828

Now fortunately , there is a , this two term root mean square end to end distance and root mean square or radius of gyration are mathematically related .	3.2986627930799597

So , if you find one , the other would be , you can get easily from that expression which both connects each other .	3.081638796983687

Now , out of these two , this radius of gyration is similar to almost like the radius , if you consider the polymer coil as sphere , if you consider coils as a sphere then this radius of gyration is similar to or proportional to the radius of this sphere .	3.3284906809700643

So , the solution properties of the polymer chain and light scattering behavior as well is mostly dictated by the radius of gyration value ; and is also useful , if you have more than one ends like if you have branched polymer then you have more than two ends , then which , end to end distance is not existing .	3.5025637819199122

Now , which end will take .	6.7804154631984215

So , in that case or if you have a cyclic polymer where there is no ends , then end to end distance is also not possible .	4.166285734805487

So , in those cases , it is useful to use the radius gyration is more useful ; whereas , in there , the root mean square end to end distance is more useful for describing the rubber elasticity behavior of a polymer coil .	2.698735789095917

So , the radius of gyration gives more , or gives the solution , the solution behavior of polymer coil is mostly dependent on the radius of gyration , where the rubber elasticity is covered by the root mean square end to end distance .	2.70985428245389

Now , we , let us find out the size of a simplest molecular model .	4.598085437549254

Now , what we will first consider , we now want to find out this values , or these values , now if we can find one of them , we know that both these are related mathematically .	3.2894441686456357

So , you can find this easily , the other one .	4.858088982946635

Now , you mainly calculate , how you find information about these and we will know the expression for this and then find out what is relation in how to get this .	3.6614260361366036

Now , let us first consider the simplistic , very simple model where you have freely jointed chain with no restriction .	3.1427113086045857

So , if you have bonds you can have , you have no restrictions .	5.219529881860074

So , if you consider this as a one bond then the other bond , you can place anywhere without having any restriction of bond angle or the rotational restriction between them .	3.0440473635700784

So , this is given by , for this the model is developed and that is again , which is just mentioned is the expression for this chain is given by random walk model , which was first developed for the movement of ideal gas ; but here the difference is that , in case of ideal gas , the steps , the gas molecules can take , this does not matter , you can take any value .	3.2321707958604162

But in this case , the each step the polymer can take or the bond can take is the length of the bond .	3.8454464231579872

So , you can start from one point , one end and just put the other randomly of course , the chain length the length of the each bond has to be equal .	3.7026761823318934

So , you can place , I am placing this randomly .	3.8681304535285554

So , you start from one end and you continually adding the further bonds in 3 D specific way , just showing a two d picture here , where you imagine this is in three dimensional .	2.501767403823399

So , this is how the random of model is designed .	3.7622525192986918

So , what is , again , continue in a random way .	4.342512362343152

So , one end is here .	6.820588082329312

So , what the model do , you put make a three dimensional coordinate , where the one end is placed as the origin of this coordinate and this is r from the what is found is what is the probability of the other end , be at distance of r from the origin .	3.0482697590710224

The way this model works is that you put the chain end at the origin of the 3 D coordinate and found out what is the probability that the other chain end would be at distance of r from the origin ; say , if you put this x y z , then the probability of that the other end would be at point x y z which is having a distance r from the origin would be given by , right .	2.981656754950319

This is , this is probability density function which is the probability unit per volume .	4.886867384318577

So , you are considering one volume , you need volume at a distance r and you are finding out what is the probability of that volume have the other end .	3.4767097982894337

When n is large , of course r is the end to end distance much lower than nl , we have this equals to , we have this expression for this , we have this where beta is.. ... Now , here we are considering one unit volume , in this place .	3.3021249337641345

So , you cannot only consider unit volume , you need to consider the volume element at distance r from , say you are not considering one point , you are considering the entire volume element which is having distance r from the origin where you find the probability of ending the other chain end .	2.969568490759685

And that can be written as… So , we are adding a volume element here with radius of r , 4 pi r squared d r is the volume element .	3.117590779065405

So , you are finding the probability of , this is the probability distribution function .	5.92754486505457

So , total probability of finding the chain , other chain end at a distance r would be the probability distribution function multiplied by the volume element .	3.6123729958953303

And this one is w r is then given by… This is radial distribution function and the other case it was Gaussian distribution function .	2.8869379194783806

Now , by this , you may not have to remember all this approach , unless you are extremely interested to know the logic behind to get the final expression .	3.507081558669151

Now , what I am trying to understand , how the approach , how , what the theoretical approach is made to find out the end to end distance , root mean square end to end distance for a random coil ; and this is how it is made .	3.1121717583453874

And finally , if we , if we neglect or ignore all the steps , we can , that is not required or we cannot have enough time to complete that what we can write that it will finally give the end to end distance like this .	3.1998906682148927

So , if you from these expressions , you finally get an expression , you remember this or you do not have to remember all the steps unless you are required , unless you are interested very much .	3.041116333325392

Now , if this subscript f , we are mentioning for a freely rotated chain or a freely jointed chain , freely jointed chain ; that means , it does not , freely jointed chain does not have any restriction or bond angle and bond protection .	2.7384033418903395

Now , as I said that fortunately there is a relation for large n and for linear molecule .	3.2610628572447338

We can write , this is your radius of gyration .	6.596153721160847

So , with this ratios , it can be shown that if you know this .	6.526945602889949

So , for if you put f here , if you put f here .	4.7545503183776905

So , freely rotating chain , we can get this expression .	6.3766136645240845

So , by writing for a simple , for a simple model , the molecular model , freely jointed chain for no restriction , we now shown that using Gaussian distribution function or random coil approach , it can be shown that the , it shows this , it has this relation ; which means that coil dimensions will be significantly lesser than the contour length , if you have a molecule of say 10000 units 10000 repeating units .	2.5855280838955954

So , if you have polyethylene molecule with 10000 repeating units , each carbon - carbon length is 1.54 Armstrong .	2.9063552300047912

So , it will be less than one intrusions by knowing that .	4.6901085340417525

So , it will be contour length ; whereas , your r m s end to end distance would be 154 Armstrong which is 100 lower than contour length , and that is coming from this n to the power half term .	2.9791359001622086

So , because you have 10000 units , you are getting 100 times lower value of the contour or r m s end to end distance .	3.413053509792903

Now let us , that is not practical , you know , the chain without a restriction , bond angle restriction or bond rotational restriction without is physically unrealistic .	2.9873798140807453

So , there are actually three restrictions , bond angle restriction , short range restriction , restriction which is coming from the single bond rotational restriction , and there is also long range steric interaction , and excluded volume effect which will , which we will encounter 1 by 1 and see how the dimension or the size of the polymer changes , this should be size not shape .	2.823494697388801

So , all this will put in a , all this restriction one after on , found and then r m s end to end distance varies , and once we know the end to end distance and always find the radius of gyration .	2.5842325171078566

Now , let us first consider these two bond angle restriction and short range rotational restriction .	3.103184543262492

Now , let us consider first a single bond ; the simple bond , one bond , if you one bond like this ; now , the other one , in case of freely rotating , in case of freely rotating chain , you can place it here , you can place it here , or even you can place it here .	2.916515678997188

There is no restriction bond angle , or you can do it in a 3 d , I am just showing a 2 d matrix .	4.162696571080068

So , you can place the other bond here , 180 degree or 90 degree or even 0 degree , there is no , there is no restriction of bond angle , in this case ; and as I said , I am just showing a two dimension here a thing , imagine you can think of three dimension as well .	3.0817504466391905

So , what would have been the average , if all this 0 to 180 degree is equally probable , then what would be the time average ?	2.8650118598788605

Time would have been 90 degree .	9.417292697247348

So , this would have been the time average value .	4.9685054906872805

So , what would have been the end to end distance ?	3.7004447120950275

It would be from this end to this end , this would have been the end to end distance .	2.971968190762144

Now actually , in case of carbon - carbon bond , what is the bond angle ?	7.0965244104516

This is the time average , there was no restriction of bond angle ; in case actual , you have no 90 degree , you have this 109.5 degree , tetrahedron bond angle , then your actual molecule bond angle would look like this .	2.6539493311730555

So , the end to end distance , which was earlier this , now it will become this .	3.785108260816054

So , because of this restriction , you can now understand that the end to end distance or time average end to end distance , root mean square end to end distance will increase from here to here .	2.9772181583327106

So for this restriction , you will have increase in the root mean square end to end distance .	3.4551365660573556

Now , it can clearly be shown , the these value where the writing f a which is angle restriction from one angle is coming , we are writing these , it can be shown that 1 minus cos theta , it can be shown that… Now , in most cases the carbon - carbon bond are the bonds , theta is between 90 degree and 180 degree , so cos theta is less than 0 ; so obviously , r square f a would be greater than r square absolute .	2.4474801478743737

So , this is the expression which now we got from the angle restriction ; what we will be the next lecture ?	4.302360736785245

We will impose the second restriction and see how this dimension changes .	3.3647885683769876

The analysis of continuous immobilized enzyme reactors interms of their performance has been based on the kinetics of the enzyme reactions .	4.0092862135735725

Then we have looked at the effect of mass transfer on the reactor performance by virtue of steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction taking place simultaneously in an enzyme reactor .	3.534486476110097

In all these analyses we have assumed that the flow pattern in the reactor is either perfectly mixed that is the contents of the reactor are homogeneously mixed without any stagnant ……. .. or without any dead pockets in the reactor or alternatively in the case of plug flow reactor the velocity profile of all the fluid streams are flat and it can be described by a ideal plug flow behavior .	2.9753003790153003

Although this kind of situation is practically feasible in a laboratory experiment where you can have a very high height to diameter ratio and have a very uniform packing in the reactor so that the plug flow characteristics are realized in the laboratory but on a large scale reactor which are real industrial reactors the possibility of achieving the ideal flow patterns that means either a complete perfect back mix or a perfect plug flow reactor are usually far from reality and most of the reactors operate closer to the one of the regimes but also have a partly mixed behavior .	2.893487876231019

Today we will like to look as at how this deviation in the ideal flow behavior influences the reactor performance .	3.222150378100665

How to approach the situation incase if the flow behavior is not ideal interms of perfectly well back mix or a plug flow behavior .	2.620261639487158

Very often we must realize that the causes of deviation from the ideality are because of certain stagnant reasons in the case of reactor .	3.0433729183171976

For example if you consider a plugflow reactor which has been separated by certain horizontal …. .. just to allow a proper mass transfer there might be certain stagnant reason from the corners or in the case of back mix reactors if the impeller is not properly designed or the mixing pattern is not properly designed there might be some region in the whole reactor where the mixing is not uniform and the idea of completely back mix is not realized .	2.4402494029006467

Alternatively there might be some channeling effect .	6.128084943937735

For example in the packed bed reactor if the particles are not of uniform size and the packing is not uniform there might be some channeling with the result that a part of the fluid stream which is getting into the reactor passes through unreacted and therefore the performance can deteriorate .	3.100928978179926

Then there might be short circuiting , something like channeling or bypassing also can take place in the case of a stirred vessel .	3.5675675585234434

An alternative situation in enzyme reactor is that sometimes we tend to develop reactor designs for various reasons because of the requirement of the reactions .	3.1615675160131365

In the case of recycle reactor as you notice here although it ’ s a packed bed reactor but just to increase the linear flow velocity to overcome the external film diffusion we may like to have a recycle stream so that the linear flow velocity is increased but ultimately it will end up in non - ideality from the plug flow behavior .	3.137384269284953

Similarly in the case of a fluidized bed reactor , we also have the same thing just to improve the mass transfer and heat transfer effects in the case of a reactor , the particles are fluidized by the substrate to the extent that the particles are not thrown out of the reactor ; they are retained in the reactor but the voidage increases to a level that they remain fluidized in the reactor and even in this case in terms of flow behavior , the flow behavior will be some where in between the plug flow as well as the packed bed reactor .	3.523338902475863

In another case if you look at the combined CSTR and ultra filtration reactor which is one of the model system which has been used for substrate which are solid in nature and where enzyme is required to be used in soluble form one can carry out the reaction in stirred reactor , in a CSTR , with the possibility of the product stream passing through a ultra filtration chamber where by the enzyme is the recycled back and the product is withdrawn from the permeate stream .	3.199650806869456

In this case also the reactor although theoretically one has to consider it closer to CSTR , but in performance if you look at , it has revelation from the CSTR because the concentration profile in the whole reactor does not remain ideally perfect .	2.6862566122375755

Similarly we have systems like hollow fiber reactor , as we discussed earlier , in which case the enzyme is entrapped in one of the side of the tubes and substrate is passed from the other side and the two sides are permeable that means they are separated by semi - permeable membrane and the reaction can take place and the product stream can go .	3.703247016068327

Although the system is designed to mimic or at least operate closely to a plug flow reactor , still the actual performance may be slightly inferior than a plugflow behavior and it might have some kind of a back mixing , partly back mixing .	2.65098589055423

Another very important industrial reactor which has been used is a spiral wound , multipore , biocatalytic module .	3.34677776942017

If you recall that the immobilized enzyme preparation is in the form of a thin long membrane film which is wrapped around a central core and the enzyme membrane is also separated by a wire mesh or some kind of a solid support so that the mechanical strength improves and this spiral wound module is then instead into the column whereby the substrate is fed from one of the end and the reactor can be operated as in a packed bed mode .	2.952135705471803

But the spiral wound module operates some where closer to only closer to plug flow behavior reactor and not exactly as a plug flow reactor .	2.416192227772271

The extent of non - ideality in the case of a flow pattern , the first parameter is that we must be able to identify the extent of non - ideality in the case of an enzyme reactor .	4.001907131854205

If we can understand or arrive by some means the distribution of the residence times of the various element of a fluid which is passing through a reactor with respect to time and that distribution can give us an idea about the extent of flow pattern .	3.0611900762698134

That means if the distribution , if it passes almost like a plug flow behavior or like a CSTR one can then compare the two patterns and see whether the flow pattern in the actual reactor is ideal or what is the extent of ideality .	2.9836193762656436

This analysis to monitor the deviation from the ideality for enzyme reactor in flow pattern is mediated by what we call as residence time distribution .	3.021734642072067

It gives you the distribution of the various elements of the fluid passing through a reactor .	4.663080593371223

That means the age of various elements in a fluid stream from the reactor interms of age distribution that means what is the duration of the time which each element of the fluid has stayed in the reactor .	2.673641624214239

That is the residence time and this if in all cases same as in the case of a space time then it should be an ideal reactor .	3.6940893609700214

If it deviates and the …. .. distribution or a residence time distribution is given in the form of …. .. verses time distribution and one can say that if this is the total … .	4.4030244156708065

distribution for any given fluid element from a reactor then your zero to infinity Edt is equal to one .	3.4039105265777305

If you just consider a very small element in this distribution having the age between t and dt and t and t + dt then the fraction of the exit stream of age between t and t + dt will be Edt and this fraction integrated over infinite time will give you the total fluid which is flowing through the reactor and the …… .	2.4597126089748547

distribution is defined that the total area under the curve is unity .	3.783225125003139

If you consider any fraction at time t1 , the fraction of the exit stream which has age less than t1 will be zero to t one Edt ; the fraction of the exit stream which has age younger than t1 .	2.597848576218896

Age means the time spent by an element of the fluid in the reactor vessel .	3.9233168547483848

On the other hand the fraction of the exit stream which is older than the t1 will be t one to infinity Edt or this will be one minus zero to t1 Edt because the total zero order infinity is one .	2.529696465897724

This residence time distribution experimentally for a given reactor system can give you an idea about the nature of non - ideality of a reactor system in terms of flow behavior .	4.054351039521829

Mind it that non - ideality may also be caused by other reasons like mass transfer , partitioning or variety of other reasons that we have discussed but this non - ideality we are talking exclusively in terms of the flow behavior .	3.130147243399377

This residence time distribution is usually determined in the experimental reactors by what we know as stimulus response techniques .	2.8391638843732916

In this technique usually a tracer which is an inert material is put along with the feed stream .	3.5911328606752253

Mind the word that you need an inert tracer which can be detected .	4.373122485953677

Detection is important because if you cannot detect this inert tracer , it doesn ’ t serve any purpose .	3.3335993961985833

Very often a dye can be used provided the dye does not interfere in the reaction or it doesn ’ t get adsorbed in the carrier material .	3.983032058491592

An inert dye can be used as a tracer system and by calorimetry it can be estimated or alternatively in the case of enzyme catalyzed reaction any other reactant or any other sugar or any other material , chemical species which will not take part in the reaction can be inserted or which should be possible to analyze at the ….. ... Very often some time one ends up in a difficult situation in choosing a good tracer .	2.940811286798525

Then in that case radioactive material could be also used as tracers so that they can be monitored at the exit stream by measurement of simple radioactivity by the counters .	3.0836456545923623

After inserting you can insert any kind of feed stimulus ; it can be a step input , it can be a delta input or it can be even a random input , doesn ’ t make a difference .	3.349697710797637

Various types of inputs can be given and ultimately at the end of it we need to monitor the response of the tracer in the exit stream mid time and the record of this gives you a picture of the residence time distribution .	3.42016437317788

That is what usually is followed .	5.119137674509469

A variety of types of tracer inputs are inserted into the vessel .	3.144184630295981

Consider this is a vessel .	13.955202916161854

We put a tracer input signal or what we call as a stimulus .	3.639041836260918

It can be a random input in any fashion ; you allow some quantity of tracer to be inserted randomly and notice the output which will also be random depending on the flow profile .	2.876405459999268

Then it can be a cyclic input in the waveform and then output also will be some type of a cyclic output .	3.6649333563339557

Then we can have a step input that means initially the tracer concentration is set at zero and then it is raised or suddenly after a time t , after some time it is in the feed stream continuously you supply a tracer let us say concentration one , hundred percent and then this input again in the reaction vessel will come out in the case of a exponential behavior .	3.1800555107482307

Alternatively you can also give a pulse input also called as delta input where over a very short period of time that means your ?	3.4798049987055215

t approaching zero you provide a small quantity of a tracer and then monitor the output .	3.146650906318439

Some of you must have done chromatographic experiments .	4.9615438383891535

Very often broadening of the output is one of the major problems .	4.7382060596831606

The theoretical chromatographic adsorption column must operate as a plug flow column but ultimately because of certain non - ideality there is some kind of broadening .	2.76673148447025

That means the fraction which you are interested is distributed over a period of time .	3.665537646345469

Ideally it should come out in a very short period of time like we have put it here but it comes out in a broadened fashion .	3.615489863688417

Although I have mentioned that any kind of input can be given but for analytical convenience we often resort to either a step input or a pulse input because ultimate analytical solutions might be difficult and the step input and pulse input are commonly used technique for analyzing or getting the residence time distribution .	2.194443418755954

The response of a step input of the tracer is usually called as F curve .	3.973927552024602

That means the F is equal to C / C0 .	5.31606112698568

If initial concentration is zero and C / C0 goes to one that means the concentration of the tracer is C0 and C / C0 is one and this is given over a period of time .	3.7862928978922645

Ultimately its response you get something like this with the average mean residence time of t bar .	3.2981437383722336

This is time and F is C / C0 .	5.138926451107857

Here F is equal to zero to t Edt and over a period of time this continues and dF / dt is the ……. .. distribution the differential of the function f C / C0 .	2.9410202091755977

On the other hand the response of a delta input is called C curve .	2.910764955014098

In fact we normalize it to get the response .	5.3045176927332705

For example normalization in this case is C bar is equal to C / Q if Q is the total quantity of a stimulus given and then its response is monitored over the period of time and Q is the total quantity of the input that is given and therefore zero to infinity C bar dt is equal to zero to infinity C / Q.dt .	2.83406142069743

We plot as C bar is equal to C / Q , the fraction of the total tracer which has been put in which emerges at any time given t and that is equal to C / Q.dt will be equal to one or Q is equal to zero to infinity C bar dt .	3.2688255381144744

C is the concentration of the tracer which is in the output stream at any given time t and Q is the total quantity of tracer that has been put in .	4.114936658016886

For example here you are not putting continuously you are putting only in one shot .	3.323915414210019

Say for example you are putting one gram of some inert dye into the reactor initially and after that you monitor its output response .	2.90703406402068

This one gram theoretically if it is an ideal plug flow , it should come out in a short period of time in as much time as it has been fed in .	3.555874422268276

But it will not emerge in one go it will come out in small lots .	4.60344769748606

If you analyze the output stream over a period of time and let us say you get such a profile and where this profile interms of the C which is output concentration at any given time t divided by the total quantity which has been fed in a normalized way and that is C bar and C / Q is the normalized concentration of the tracer output in the exit stream and the C / Q verses t gives you a C curve .	3.2199545106263296

This shows the performance of a plug flow reactor as a response to a pulse input .	3.5707899502768

Up to some time there is no concentration of tracer ; suddenly at a given time we start a stream continuing the tracer and so here it becomes C0 .	2.971449303133949

If C / C0 is one and from then onwards the input is same and the output stream theoretically after a time t it should also come out in a constant stream but it doesn ’ t come out in constant stream .	2.8872752536425006

There is a kind of transient phase till it reaches to the constant stream and that is what it defines .	3.502055720430983

This tracer information can be used directly or in conjunction with the flow model to predict the performance of the real flow reactors .	3.1443217237427583

Theoretically the ideal reactor performance we have been looking at interms of the reaction kinetics .	4.821977455619379

That means we develop a mass balance equation for a particular reactor , apply the reaction kinetics and analyze the equation and get the final reactor performance equation interms of tow verses the fractional conversion or the remaining substrate concentration in the reactor .	3.3107014845977965

These …… distribution also can be used to determine the reactor performance based on the flow profile along with the reaction kinetics .	4.945230743607179

If you look at the C curve which is very commonly used for analysis of packed bed reactor , in the case of a C curve on the basis of the flow pattern the mean concentration of the substrate in the exit stream will be equal to the sum of all this elements of the exit stream for concentration of substrate remaining in an element of age t + dt into the fraction of exit stream which is of age t + dt .	3.3369494952152543

That means if you take a differential element of the fluid stream which passes through time dt , whatever the concentration of substrate in that stream which is passing through time dt multiplied by the fraction of the exit stream which is of age between t and dt and t + dt , and sum it over the all the elements .	2.9099475148553413

This is the concentration of the substrate in one element of the age dt between t and t + dt and the fraction of the exit stream which is half the age between t + dt that means during the time dt and if you multiply the two you get the mean concentration of substrate in the exit stream and if you sum it up this one over all the elements or integrate it S bar will be equal to t equal to zero to infinity S element into Edt .	2.7926169535331016

This is the fraction of stream Edt ; this is the concentration of substrate remaining in the element .	4.846046719258466

This Sel is element concentration of substrate remaining in the element which is of age t + ?	3.5315356093613417

t and this is the fraction Edt .	11.62835266225373

These two terms indicate the concentration term as well as the age term in the reactor .	4.541853469824343

The mean substrate concentration in the reactor will be given by this .	5.506139490795148

If you write for a first order kinetics Sel will be equal to Sel = S0e - kt You can assume this K is V ’ m / K ’ m , a first order rate constant for the enzyme reaction and you can also write therefore here S bar from the RTD data will be equal to S0 ?	3.032224099990373

e - Kt.Edt What it amounts to is that if you have a residence time distribution for any real reactor in the form of Edt and if you also have the rate constant K , the first order rate constant which can be evaluated for enzyme reaction and you can get all the reaction fraction of the exit stream which has been collected and sum it over , it will give the mean age distribution , the mean substrate concentration in the exit stream .	3.4475280458126303

Normally a residence time distribution , a C curve will be of this type .	4.444466307066045

In practice what we do is if we operate a reactor we are making feed from the bottom at some concentration S0 .	3.02165359166533

This is S .	12.74781732236594

Suddenly at any given time t a tracer is inserted into the reactor in the feed stream by short period of time and the concentration is monitored in the exit stream .	3.747619484874773

At time t = 0 , 5 at equidistant time if you determine the concentration of the tracer whatever values come at equidistant time , they are plotted in terms of C / Q .	3.3626831771871344

That means you consider the SC ?	7.554350787205956

t = Q .	26.768039641225993

Here is also a check that this SC ?	5.069018333777892

t = Q of all the data must be equal to the actual quantity of tracer which has been put in .	4.200027021602678

If there is any absorption of some tracer into the system or some reaction taking place or if the tracer is not a good choice that means either it is participating in the reaction .	3.0314804039496805

In that case the total amount of tracer which has been put in to the reactor will not be equal to SC ?	4.221585866044571

t and such an analysis is erroneous in nature .	4.435336063041934

It should not be accepted for determining the flow behavior and once you checked that the total quantity of tracer which has been put in matches with the tracer quantity which has come out in the output stream , which is SC ?	2.9604980622810593

t and then one can substitute or write down the integration term in terms of S0 ?	4.162840980306736

e - Kt.Edt and sum it over , you will get the concentration of the substrate remaining unreacted in the exit stream as a function of flow behavior and reaction kinetics .	3.7393521521446593

On the other side the same performance can also be judged by purely kinetic analysis .	3.5965386411455342

That means in the case of plug flow reactor tow is equal to S0 0 to x dx / K.S ; classical balance equation which gives you the performance of a plug flow reactor and from this one can write S = S0e - Kt .	3.4465616023186088

That means because in the case of first order reaction there will be an exponential consumption of substrate with time and therefore if one takes a real data of a particular plug flow reactor based on kinetic analysis and based on experimental value , this will be actually based on the experimental data .	3.3061961257204504

Sometime one finds that there is a large deviation .	6.202122533856541

That means this performance will be inferior than this one if the reactor is not an ideal plug flow .	3.591272689804517

If it is an ideal plug flow , the closeness of these values S as well as S bar will indicate the ideality of the reactor flow pattern .	3.2830914561637687

But in case there is deviation one will find quite different values and the actual reactor performance will be judged by the reactor performance based on the …… distribution and kinetics .	3.241093174602265

If you consider the characteristics F curves for different kinds of flow profiles , in the case of ‘ a ’ curve you have a typical F curve for a plug flow reactor .	3.2302366990950224

That means as soon as the tracer concentration in that plug flow reactor has been inserted after time t or Qt / V or one residence time , the tracer must come out in the same concentration in the case of a step input .	3.358737839250922

In the case of a plug flow with some …… mixing that means a non - ideal plug flow , the behavior instead of being like this , it may be something like this .	2.870363091770992

The output becomes instead of vertically … .	4.778373903505238

a curved one , the deviation of this from the vertical absorption gives the non - ideality .	2.973020734970775

In the case ‘ c ’ , this is the performance with the perfect mixing .	4.175377689471726

An exponential output of the tracer from the reactor .	5.147295381919321

After time zero as soon as you put in the tracer , there will be a dilution or mixing taking place and the tracer will get diluted and from zero concentration it will come to a concentration finally all the tracer will come out .	3.187941086867495

On the other hand if there is a mixing with some dead zones , some stagnant zones again the mixing pattern might get unchanged .	2.6309636782287615

So these are the two non - ideal flow patterns and these are the two for plug flow as well for well mixed conditions the exit age distribution in terms of F curve .	3.1139425046303377

Earlier we have seen the use of ‘ C ’ curve for getting the reactor performance .	5.198325190626959

If you want to identify or detect the deviation from ideality using the ‘ F ’ curve then consider a CSTR , a continuous stirred tank reactor and give a step change in the concentration of tracer in the feed stream .	2.863995469633421

Consider a stirred reactor of constant volume V where the substrate is put , the product stream is coming out and the step input is added here at a concentration C0 and the flow velocity is Q .	3.176365404507908

Therefore the total mass balance that is QC0 = QC + Vdc / dt That means the C will also start coming out here at a flow rate of Q .	2.6621550008617896

There will be some change in the rate of change of concentration of C in the reactor .	4.869138045268809

Therefore this can be integrated to give C / C0 = 1 - exp ( - Qt / V ) This is the theoretical output for a step change in a CSTR .	3.813018766687333

If you make a plot of this curve a semi logarithmic plot that means ln C / C0 or ln 1 - C / C0 verses time you will end up with a slope of Q / V and intercept of ln 1 that is zero .	2.8417910916687754

For an ideal reactor such kind of response is obtainable .	3.9238441208093446

If you assume that there is some kind of deviation from ideality and in the case of CSTR the kind of deviation could be of two types .	3.7868297518751817

One is that there is some kind of a non - mixing or part of the stream which is being fed here , Q is going unmixed .	3.696098192641837

This is 1 - f1 , f1 is going to the reactor for mixing .	4.199961364019757

This is volume V and the fraction f1of the total stream Q is going into the reactor .	3.5562392081158243

The 1 - f1 fraction is getting channeled or bypassed from the mixing pattern and therefore one is losing .	2.842011220591008

The fraction f2 of the total volume of the reactor is represented as a dead zone .	4.025142129224476

There mixing is not taking place .	8.475863188773847

If you write a mass balance for such a system then you will get f1.Q.C0 .	4.5355317898788

We are putting C0 as step input of tracer .	3.7690535381755432

f1.Q.C0 = f1.Q.C + f2.V dc / dt f1.Q.C is the fraction which will come out ; f2.V is the one which is dead zone .	3.5405067621814967

In the case of a non - ideal system which incorporates a fraction of the feed stream which is directly channeled out into the exit stream and another fraction of the total volume of the reactor which is almost like a dead zone and does not participate in the reaction process .	3.7108861625919998

No . This f2 is the fraction of total volume which is stagnant .	4.590341054945764

Here the f2 is not of the total feed stream .	4.834009246671563

Of the total feed stream f1 has come into the reactor and 1 - f1 has gone untouched from the reactor .	3.064204589495819

Of the total volume of the reactor V , a fraction f2 is a dead zone .	4.026924885411862

Yeah we have now because we have a dead zone .	6.56732142936003

Okay . Then we can write probably this is 1 - f2 the total of the active volume and this becomes f2.V .	4.112413056962705

So the total fraction f2 is well mixed and so ( 1 - f2 ) .V is the dead zone .	3.290374568790233

So the rate of concentration will be f2.V dc / dt .	5.232767868061842

f2 is the fraction which is in the mixed zone as per this mass balance .	4.494238074410627

So 1 - f2 is the dead zone and therefore if you integrate this equation you will get C / C0 = exp ( - f1Qt / f2V ) This can be combined with the outflow stirred equation that means the mass balance equation .	3.131601675125011

That is F ( t ) = C / C0 = ( 1 - f1 ) + exp ( - f1Qt / f2V ) If you plot this profile …… .	3.212626076769889

distribution C / C0 , you will get a different kind of a profile from which the parameters f1and f2 can be calculated .	3.908423830615598

The slope will be - f1 / f2 .	7.452730303290203

If you plot Qt / V verses C / C0 the slope will be - f1 / f2 minus and the intercept will be ln C / C0 .	3.4228212308098653

The input in the reactor going is only f1Q .	5.33795657191225

This is not going to the reactor .	7.174719678234165

This is the actual input to the reactor and this is the exit stream which is going f1QC and this undergoes change in the concentration .	4.1912311426670295

Therefore by comparing the two profiles you can see the order of deviation the dead zone and the mixed stream in the reactor has gone into performance .	3.3705816084181146

That is to illustrate the use of residence time distribution in the case of a real reactor which can be used to determine the reactor performance and such a reactor performance then can be used to calculate or correct the actual performance based on the kinetics data .	4.005656073319718

The other way to handle is to develop the full flow models which can vary in degree of complexity depending upon where you can either consider the dispersion as a parameter and thereby you can write dispersion mass balance equations based on dispersion and finalize the reactor performance equation .	2.4196806924740595

Alternatively you can also consider as a like a tangent series model because a plug flow reactor or plug flow pattern can be considered as a infinite number of CSTR in series and plug flow can be considered as a CSTR in series and if you can calculate based on the reactor performance , the number of CSTR in series as equivalent to the plug flow that can quantify the reactor performance .	3.0660584656138656

Their order of complexity increases on the basis of the number of parameters considered .	4.801476303245073

But even the residence time distribution can give you reasonably good idea of the non - ideality of the flow based on which one can even monitor the reactor performance and use that information particularly for scaling it up when you want to go on a larger scale reactor .	2.938979731258628

We will stop at this point .	4.181671791906674

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In this lecture , we will continue our discussion on chain copolymerization , which we began in the last lecture and the lecture before .	2.9520569897531934

Now , we have talked about different types of copolymers , random copolymers , copolymers , alternate copolymers , block copolymers .	3.2845546199226927

Then , we talked about importance of copolymerization in last lecture , how we can improve the property of an existing homo polymer by introducing another co - monomer in the polymer .	3.480709507888645

Then , we talked about copolymer composition equation .	6.845615608234948

We applied simple model of terminal model , where we basically we are talking about how the composition of copolymer can be predicted from the reaction , reactivity monomer reactivity ratios .	3.3309909378276044

We started our discussion on different types of copolymerization .	6.572469058001193

Then as a result of different types of copolymerization , what are the different types of copolymer micro structure possible ?	4.550782307722253

We started and we are half way in that discussion .	4.504137650253519

So , we will start from this today and then move on to composition drift in a copolymer as we go on increasing the conversion in the copolymerization reaction .	3.1577384088822367

Then , monomer reactivity , how it depends on the different modes of chain initiation and then talk about effect of structure on reactivities , mainly in radical copolymerization .	3.2529077274756784

We will discuss Q - e scheme and then briefly discuss the ionic copolymerization .	3.130481498826889

Then , invariably we will talk about application of the copolymers , we are talking about .	4.568903231421939

Now , we continue the discussion we are having in last lecture .	3.487255115462358

You know we have talked about different types of copolymers .	5.733074205345629

For example , we have talked that in first case , if your r 1 r 2 is 1 is gives us ideal copolymerization .	3.282166994097392

Now , this happens if the monomers have very similar structures and most of the ionic polymerizations also follow this type of behavior .	3.658130570013009

There is a special case , which where both r 1 r 2 are 1 .	3.812008077795991

In that case , we have seen that F 1 is mole fraction of the monomers same as the mono fractions in the feed .	4.592840106442467

We have seen the second type , where this product is equals to 0 and which gives towards alternate copolymerization .	3.579846977504938

As a special case , where r 1 r 2 both are 0 is perfect alternate copolymer , where basically f 1 , so as f 2 is 0.5 .	2.823751697021279

The closer this ratio r 1 r 2 to 0 , it is the resulting copolymer will be more towards alternate .	4.280214695045244

Now , we will talk about the third option possible , where r 1 multiplied by r 2 is neither 0 nor neither 1 .	3.02762941817946

Now , this is first possibility , where one of the monomer reactivity ratios is more than 1 .	5.236115348127643

Another would be obviously less than 1 .	5.1156004769572245

It could be the other way as usual .	5.854246656517519

It could be r 1 could be less than 1 or r 2 could be less than 1 .	3.313930381823642

Usually these products , this product is less than 1 .	4.91691716309629

In some cases , they are slightly above 1 and possible and in the usual copolymer reaction .	3.529923451397245

Now , in this case , what happened ?	6.3705156767990685

So , it is similar to the ideal composition copolymerization .	4.484890092179849

If I plot F 1 with f 1 , in case of ideal , we have seen that is r 1 is r 2 is equal to 1 .	4.243107221450079

This is r 1 greater than 1 , r 2 less than 1 .	4.591975250483191

What r 1 r 2 is equal to 1 ?	8.201240077855797

Now , if this is not equals to 1 and if r 1 is the more reactive monomer compared to r 2 , M 1 is the more reactive monomer compared to M 2 , and then it will be skewed .	3.931530827011328

This was for ideal .	8.647721126608804

Then , it this will be skewed towards , it will be skewed towards the more reactive monomer .	4.508630140565118

The higher this ratio , this r 1 by r 2 , the higher this ratio of r 1 r 2 , the higher the longer is the continuous sequence of M 1 type monomer in the copolymer and shorter is the sequence of the M 2 , M 2 monomer .	3.171147591516289

So , if this is higher means the M 1 will have a longer sequence in the copolymer , and M 2 you have a shorter sequence in the co monomer .	3.9636141995258636

In extreme case , if r 1 is very high and r 2 is very , very low , then the tendency would be to make consecutive homo polymers because this is very high .	4.286755515906914

Then , you will get something like and r 2 is very small .	6.625360649778615

So , in some cases , you might get M 2 getting in and then again may be one more at M 2 .	3.4245855147367785

So , basically M 1 will have a much higher tendency to more polymerize , whereas M 2 has little tendency to move polymerize .	3.2038699721082384

Whatever tendency it has to react , it will make copolymer towards copolymer .	4.297344311296989

So , if the situation is like this , then you are going to get a polymer like this , which is essentially a homo polymer because it is mostly M 1 with sometime M 2 here and there entering in the copolymer .	3.552262950214421

Example is that styrene and vinyl acetate .	5.17760743087403

The ratio of reactivity ratios are r 1 if this is M 1 , this is M 2 .	5.290482910389902

r 1 is 55 in case of radical polymerization and r 2 is 0.01 .This is for a radical polymerization .	5.305677303174376

So , basically styrene have much higher tendency to homo polymerize compared to copolymerized with vinyl acetate , where as vinyl acetate has very little tendency to homo polymerize .	2.5391007138210084

So , you will get essentially homo polymer of styrene at the beginning at the beginning .	4.061830355007264

Then once the styrene is consumed , and then you will get the homo polymer of vinyl acetate .	4.457248266439483

Now , the second options in this case would be where r both both r 1 is less than 1 and r 2 is less than 1 .	3.456107324553156

Now , obviously r 1 r 2 is less than 1 , both not equals to 0 .	4.800574945328675

Now , this because both of these are less than 1 , so both of these monomers have a tendency to more tendencies to copolymerize compared to homo polymers .	3.0175642770305364

As a result , there would be tendency to towards alternation rather than forming homo polymers .	2.748091961084884

F 1 versus f 1 curve will cross ; F 1 is equal to f 1 curve line rather at one point , which corresponds to azeotropic mole fraction f 1 azo .	2.6974237202708933

Now , in this case , if both are less than 1 , you will get a line like this which will cross over in this point .	3.481537328391863

So , this composition is corresponding to f 1 azo .	4.599519192578675

Now , the term azeotropic mole fraction is coming because we know azeotrops were mole fraction of 2 liquids in vapor phase equals to the mole fraction of the 2 liquids in liquid phase .	2.8857464276825158

Basically , the liquids , 2 liquids actually vaporized in the same mole fraction in the vapor phase .	3.524967142621536

So , here the composition in the free monomer is same as in the co - polymer , copolymer .	5.4769782405659

So , if you take a particular composition and polymerize , then we will get always the same concentration or same composition of the co - polymers .	3.6690714890549154

Here and if I write this , so in this case , the M 1 now at this point , the copolymers and the feed compositions are same .	3.797094003455479

Co - polymers occur without changing the composition in the feed ratio .	4.37558084010333

That is why we call this as an azeotropic composition .	4.87444510243434

We can get these from our r d r expression we derived in the last lecture as this .	2.9696567851244136

So , if you know the reactivity ratios r 1 r 2 , then we can get the azeotropic composition at which we can get an azeotropic co - polymerization .	4.372585703421562

So , if you do a co - polymerization starting for a composition monomer composition here , then the corresponding copolymerization will be termed as azeotropic co - polymerization .	2.5703480737254187

Now , there is a third possibility in this set .	4.908539561227812

Here , you have both r 1 and r 2 greater than 1 .	5.597858988001619

Obviously , r 1 r 2 would be greater than 1 .	6.347093867294615

Now , in this is very rare .	7.233170852648267

It is not very usual thing observed for a monomer pair , but if that is the case , then both the monomer has a greater tendency to homo polymerize compare to copolymerize .	3.104005141753172

So , these would be having tendency towards block copolymer formation .	3.3636706578421305

Now , basically we have covered almost all possibilities of different combination of r 1 and r 2 values .	3.164470164123501

Now , let us see how these different types of copolymers would result in a variation in composition .	3.0990327810377916

So , how this different set of values of r 1 r 2 , how that would be changing the combination of our copolymer composition with conversion ?	2.8471781015586424

This means in the beginning of the reaction , if we stop the copolymerization reaction , at this lower say less than 5 percent conversion , and then you will get a copolymer , which is having a higher mole fraction of the M 1 unit in the copolymer compared to that is in the feed .	3.957543086516925

So , as a result , what will happen ?	5.812712446978257

With time , with conversion , the monomer composition the monomer composition will have less and less M 1 because M 1 is getting incorporated in the chain in faster rate .	3.183115195496059

So , you will have a drift in drift in monomer composition with time .	3.6280501867173482

As a result , you will get drift in the copolymer composition as well .	4.109790271544139

So , if you want to avoid this drift in copolymer composition , you should be restricting your copolymerization reaction to very lower level of conversion , so that the feed ratio the monomer ratio in the reaction medium does not alter too much compared to the feed ratio .	2.939266632177496

Now , if you compare the other cases like r 1 and r 2 is 0 .	4.283678846137715

Now , in this case because this is a more of an alternate copolymer as long as that more reactive monomer in this case say , r 1 is greater than 0 and r 2 is 0 .	3.9295183005144523

As long as M 1 is remaining in the reaction medium , they will form alternate copolymer , but once M 1 is consumed , even if there are free M 2 present in the reaction medium , they cannot undergo homo polymerization because r 2 is 0 .	3.17668630980922

So , basically at the end in during the most of the reaction time , you will get same composition of the resulting copolymers .	5.992667276949593

If you start with excess M 1 , then at the beginning , you will get alternate copolymers .	4.462292521770952

When M 2 is getting over all the M 2 is getting incorporated in the copolymer chain , you will get rest of the M 1s , which is remaining .	3.8935302373183083

They will homo polymerize .	7.9819565098328855

So , you get an alternate copolymer at the beginning .	4.8573735651610965

At the end , you get a homo polymer of M 1 .	6.543247189823186

Look at this plot versus mole ratio mole percentage in the copolymer .	3.352249224932076

In the monomer , if you start from a composition here say , this point because M 1 is getting incorporated faster .	3.3554800702735577

So , in this case , below this point before this point , M 1 is getting incorporated in the chain faster .	3.2209483911576404

After this point , it is M 1 is getting incorporated in a slower rate .	3.958604479291935

So , what will happen if you start from this point ?	5.736746660319184

If you start a point somewhere above this point , then less fraction of M 1 would get into the chain .	2.7572084810954416

As a result , slowly with combustion , the concentration of mole fraction of M 1 monomer in the chain in the reaction medium would be going to 1 .	4.242725710660528

So , in this case , you you actually go through with composition , where M 1 in the M 1 the mole fraction of M 1 in the reaction medium either 0 or 1 .	3.0717274331057185

So , accordingly , you will get drift in the copolymer composition as well .	4.556616851842094

So , these are the some examples , which we are , which you can which you can now convince that there is a tendency in this copolymer .	4.47533367047992

In the most , most cases except when r 1 is r 2 is equals to 1 or r 1 and r 1 r 2 is 0 .	3.7048140195085906

In case of these cases , you have a drift in the composition as you increase the conversion or as the reaction progresses with time .	4.278528344641867

So , what is usually done in in practice industry in most of the applications is require that you cannot have this much of drift in the composition of your polymer sample .	3.2036165171305675

There is a basically , there is a control over the composition in the entire polymer sample is required .	4.685158262553219

Either you start the reaction from a known a feed ratio or stop the reaction at a very low conversion say less than 5 percent , but that is not very practical .	3.620642719191202

Then , you have to take out the polymer from that monomer mixture and restart the polymers and so on .	4.223631861742623

So , that is not very practical .	7.8138472206201754

So , what is practically done is basically you you add the more reactive monomer , which is getting incorporated in the chain mass in a faster rate .	3.2082871461988693

That monomer is added in a controlled manner in the reaction medium .	3.9894269249064935

So , in effect , you basically fix or you you basically remain or maintain the feed ratio , the monomer of M 1 and M 2 unchanged during the inter polymerization so that the copolymer composition also does not change during the inter polymerization .	2.8995415350533995

So , you basically get homogenous polymers .	4.916267127251989

Now , let us talk about that , monomer reactivity , reactivities and chain initiation .	3.28604358208381

Now , we have seen that the disc scheme what we have been talking till now is valid for radical initiation or ionic initiation , but this values , the set of values for r 1 and r 2 , they are almost independent for a radical initiated chain copolymerization , but the values of individual r 1 and r 2 could dramatically change if the mode of initiation is changed .	2.5766791632438384

For example , if I take a set of monomer like say , let us take an example of styrene and MMA , methyl methacrylate radical .	3.1001487586707737

They have more or less similar reactivity .	5.710187337475537

So , r 1 has 0.5 and r 2 is 0.44 .	5.952659018427639

So , if I plot that f 1 where M 1 is styrene .	3.9608154499757

Now , in case of radical copolymerization of styrene and MMA , it would looks like something like this .	3.047841675334485

As you can see from this , r 1 is also less than 1 and r 2 is less than 1 , but their re - activities are not very different .	3.4753266082116037

Now , if you do a cationic polymerization , then obviously styrene is much more reactive compared to MMA in a cationic polymerization .	3.6497723568956535

So , you get a curve like this .	4.737592872166871

In case of an ionic , you get the other way round because in case of an ionic , the reactivity of methyl methaacrylate is much faster compared to styrene .	4.305849176437261

So , with this , this page shows that for a given radical reaction , you know this r 1 and r 2 values are almost same .	3.8715907460535366

You know they do not change too much with reaction conditions like temperature and reaction medium , but if we have different chain initiation mode .	3.328442433251438

Then obviously the react monomer reactivity ratios will differ , will dramatically different , which depends on the stabilization of the resulting active center .	2.9695409289914387

Obviously , for these ionic , this also may depend on the solvent polarity and the counter and so on .	3.4566402643042236

Now , how do we determine this r 1 and r 2 experimentally we have been talking about ?	3.8415468300993276

So , determination of or evaluation of reactivity ratios , so I write just like r .	3.0920772947816695

Now , as we , as I mentioned earlier also that this expression is we talked about this expression in the last lecture .	4.601533219830906

It this is valid for no numerical number of set of monomers or pair of monomers irrespective of whether the initiation is done by radical or ionic .	2.992002003012438

So , we can use this expression and from that , we can actually get the value for r 1 and r 2 .	6.049310880792228

Now , this expression can be rearranged and written like this .	3.8269600655989042

Now , what is what can be done is basically you do several reactions .	4.008288253214824

Start with different f 1 values .	6.937615741016647

You take feed monomer ratio with different f 1 values and stop the reaction say less than 5 percent conversion and quantify the amount of mole fraction of the monomer unit present in the copolymer at the end of this 5 percent or when you stop the reaction .	3.502848394223626

You can do it by spectroscopic thing mix like enema , UV or IR or even for more sophisticated cases ; you can actually radio level the monomers .	2.5976319077835663

Actually , from the radio activity measurements , you can actually get the incorporation of individual monomers in the copolymers .	3.4101797908767284

Feed ratio , you can get from the like normal chromatographic analysis like h p as n g c .	3.1890668952260612

So , what you have now for a different state of f 1 ?	4.530622970884564

You have values of capital F 1 .	5.4004803067810725

So , you make a plot where you put these in y axis this one and put these in x axis .	3.2755959666623338

So , the slope would give you r 1 and the intercept should give you r 2 .	4.161693495836813

So , that is one of the ways you can determine from experimental value , experiment different experiment with different feed ratio and stopping the reaction at low conversion and then measuring the mole fraction of different monomers in the copolymer , but this is a old method .	3.4680596343731445

Now days , these are not practiced .	7.876907412721267

We are not going into detail of those methods , but essentially , the concept or the principle of determining r 1 and r 2 is similar , where you do the reaction in different feed monomer ratios and then stop the reactions at low conversion and get the copolymer composition .	2.9676785148476514

Then , do from that , you can get the reactivities of the monomer reactivity values of r 1 and r 2 .	4.740345296939528

Now , let us talk about the effect of structure monomer structure on reactivities or reactivity ratios .	3.242655650383541

Now , before I going to this , let us show you some number of just to say these are tabulated from known values .	2.4271000235584896

Now , these are the some of the numbers of different r 1 , r 2 , r and their product as well .	4.165107514880399

So , for example , if you compare maleic anhydride and styrene , individual individual r 1 and r 2 , they are very close to 0 .	4.009672755195436

So , basically they do not have a tendency to homo polymerize when they are together .	4.7856675282991175

So , there is is a tendency to copolymerize all the time .	4.134083319804226

Now , when the structures are quite similar like this tetra fluoro ethylene and ethylene or tetra fluoro ethylene and mono chloro tri fluoro ethylene , their structures are very similar .	2.183756735358041

So , their reactivity ratios are almost close to 1 .	4.874081741321426

So , they basically give a perfect ideal copolymerization .	4.037662888011655

If you take a case like acrylonitrile and butadiene , then this is this is a higher number .	4.863941116171391

This is a lower number .	7.116479328345818

So , butadiene acrylonitrile has more tendencies to homo polymerization and butadiene will have higher tendency to copolymerization .	3.0783659970911565

So , you essentially get copolymer at the beginning .	4.017411213053152

They will be rich in the monomer may be right from acrylonitrile and once acrylonitrile is consumed , then you will get homo polymers of butadiene .	2.832294615644131

So , basically you can get this r 1 and r 2 numbers from any standard literature and from there , you can compare this r 1 r 2 values and their product to get idea about how about the reactivities of the different monomers and the resulting copolymer .	3.14863278275347

How the nature is , the microstructure of the copolymer from definite pair of monomers and the possible drift in the copolymer composition from these values of r 1 and r 2 .	3.347662203535719

Now , let us go back and see the effect of structure and reactivity .	4.178951647638996

Now , in case of radical , first talk about the radical reaction .	5.469607976137019

Now , in case of radical reactions , these copolymer reaction rates would depend on like resonance , resonance stability of the monomers or the substituent , which is present .	3.3593563238807502

So , basically if I talk about the monomer like this , then the ability to of the Y group to stabilize any resulting radical and then polar polarity polar effect .	2.813711848016068

How these double bond is polarized , is it the electron deficient or electron rich and steric effect ?	2.941188601369179

Basically , it is steric effect of the substituent group .	5.273138454822861

Now , what is the reaction in a in a in a basically copolymerization or radical reaction ?	4.839825359847587

You have radical and you have that is reacting in monomer to form another radical .	3.7959397124123826

So , if you want to compare reactivity of different monomer to a particle particular radical say , if you in this case , if I fix this radical , this polymer radical or propagating radical , let us fix this and then if I want to compare different monomers , how the reactions will look like ?	2.794067469745378

So , let us keep this intact and M 1 , this will lead to M 1 dot M 2 .	3.5719659046686383

This will lead to M 2 dot .	7.280927947847508

So , what it essentially means ?	5.956831566128409

If the propagating radical is more stable , then the reaction will go towards right hand side .	4.852764529336615

If it is not that stable , then reaction will not tend to go towards right hand side .	3.462546103651171

So , basically the reactivity of different monomers towards a particular particle towards a particular radical will depend on the stability of the resulting radical from that monomer .	4.431833431219434

So , higher the stability , higher is the reactivity .	5.678745296768745

So , if I want to rank different monomers , I have to rank according to their ability to stabilize .	3.029724218119018

So , if I write Y phi , this has very strong civilization effect on the radical .	3.362279555746759

Then , this follows the ability of these substituent groups to stabilize the radical generated from this monomer .	3.260531929707942

So , basically in this case , this has the least ability to stabilize a radical .	4.037679290480094

If Y is H or Y is OR , that has the least ability to stabilize this radical .	2.61556287436755

So , they have least reactivity towards a particular polymer radical .	4.499748805160932

Now , this has a very high ability to stabilize this radical .	5.470134930569939

So , they have a much higher reactivity towards a particular radical .	5.615339948527586

Now , if I want to compare the reactivity of the radicals , see if I want to compare reactivity of different radicals with a single monomer , then what it will give ?	3.788672740761459

So , in all the cases , it will produce the same radical .	5.319228107558562

So , the stability of this resulting propagating radical will be same .	4.98532751698305

Hence , the reactivity order of these different radicals towards a monomer will be inverse towards the stability of this radical .	3.4753236633713724

So , the monomer which is or the radicals which is least stabilized , they will have the highest reactivity towards a particular monomer .	3.824040451793433

So , in this case , the order of reactivity of the radical will be exactly reverse for what we just solved for the reactivity of monomers towards a single radical .	3.8508739291369483

So , one more time , this is this this order will follow for the reactivity of this monomers towards a given radical .	4.058839261600824

Now , the radicals from these monomers will have exactly the reverse order , when you compare their reactivity towards single monomers .	2.5582836187415046

Now , let us compare some numbers .	5.005178669852607

This is the rate constant for radical monomer reactions for different monomers and different polymer radical .	4.10166768007534

So , if I compare different monomers with a particular radical say like styrene in this case or MMA in this case , so you will see that these numbers lower in this , which means the order of reactivity of these monomers following this order , which we just showed in the last page for a particular radical .	3.7486749237808183

So , if you are doing reaction of this monomers towards say styrene radical , then they will follow this strength and the radicals towards a particular monomer , say like say acrylonitrile .	3.129623379719543

All the radicals will follow the reverse strength .	4.794403516793247

So , vinyl acetate will have the highest reactivity compared to the other polymer radicals for particular monomers .	4.404125588810106

So , in this case , if I take acrylonitrile , vinyl acetate has much higher reactivity compared to acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate and styrene .	3.381844370213207

Now , in this case , you have the highest reactivity , most stable monomer .	4.428504278155429

A stabilized monomer will have more reactivity towards a particular radical and radicals , which are unstabilized .	3.870496287720952

They will have higher reactivity towards a particular monomer .	4.702301827147672

So , the reactivity order would be this .	5.55672260943409

So , if you compare the reaction of styrene plus vinyl acetate , this radical form vinyl acetate high reactive and in this case , styrene monomer .	3.3797363356296075

So , this is a vinyl acetate radical plus styrene monomer , vinyl acetate radical plus vinyl acetate monomer , styrene radical plus styrene monomer , styrene radical plus vinyl acetate monomer .	2.4716687546191425

A stands for stabilize .	8.965893176836978

So , styrene is stabilized monomer and styrene radical generated from styrene is a stabilized radical .	2.883785619343552

So , this will have highest tendency .	5.465115140174143

So , if we have a vinyl acetate radical in the reaction medium , then it will always copolymerize .	5.089926134650796

If you have styrene radical in a medium , then it will always homo polymerize .	4.269753099478138

So , basically if you have a reaction radical reaction , radical copolymerization between styrene and vinyl acetate , these are the 2 products of the reaction propagating dominantly .	4.054080352291455

So , it will be homo polymers of styrene and some alternate of copolymer of vinyl and vinyl acetate and styrene .	3.4347302822065835

That is why the reactivity ratios are so different .	4.9742160544593

M 1 is styrene and vinyl acetate is M 2 .	5.989429846758964

Now , these are these are all about steric resonance effect .	4.500016461674335

You can also have steric effect polar effect .	4.623244048523689

Let us talk about the polar effect first .	5.154270351346384

Now , if you have electron withdrawing groups like in the monomers like say COOR , CN or COR , you could have electron donating group like CH 3 , OR .	2.942867094680298

If your electron withdrawing group , then this double bond will be electron deficient .	4.50906301018648

So , basically there will be effectively positive and if you are electron donating group , basically it will be electron rich double bond .	4.373844694286204

So , if you have monomers which are very different in their polarity of the double bond , then they will tend to form alternate copolymers .	4.212774583081843

If you have similar polarity , then they will tend to form an ideal polymerization .	3.429081668801329

So , if I compare acrylonitrile and say methyl phenyl ketone , then they will have almost ideal polymerization copolymerization .	2.884162543207599

If you compare taking to different groups , where they are this electron deficient and this is electron rich , then they will tend to be forming alternate copolymers .	3.142057153263309

So , if you choose 2 sets monomer from 2 different sets , then they will form alternate copolymer .	3.32408891090046

If you choose monomers from same sets , then they will tend to form a ideal polymer .	3.4035321080098906

You can have also steric effect affecting the monomer ratios .	3.4115454723854226

For example , if you have like compare these two , this basically have very low reactivity because they are 1 , 2 substituent .	3.3744956391570846

If you compare these with X and Y , then this steric does not play much role .	3.020349403637533

Then , the resonance stabilization actually raditive , when they are present in a same carbon atom whereas , they are 1 2 substituent , then steric actually have a very detrimental effect .	3.2467442694522988

So , reactivity actually comes down very much .	5.090539447360348

Now , some cases , this polarity , this steric effect , the polarity effect actually can help in polymerize or we overcome the steric effects .	2.3546887625377537

For example , if I take a monomer of this sort .	3.6130284351129163

Like take maleic anhydride and stacked Sullivan .	4.73770641842232

Because of steric effect , these 2 individual monomers , they cannot homo polymerize because they are 1 2 substituent .	3.454739968141123

They are steric problem .	8.064940262125782

But , their polarity is different .	6.444673098496039

This is highly electron deficient and this is highly electron rich .	5.363396643052917

So , what happens ?	8.646089926521524

These polarity effects actually help them to form copolymer .	3.520290316136096

So , you will have alternate copolymer forming just to give you some number about the steric effect .	3.6122784634439493

If I take , let us keep that for time being .	3.680509497176966

Now , in case of radical polymerization , in radical copolymerization , the reactivity does not depend too much on the reaction medium .	3.708369182273825

However , if the because of the medium , if the availability of monomers are different , then they actually affect or they affect their availability in copolymerization .	3.394648412986029

As a result , you can get effective different composition , which is not predicting from their r 1 and r 2 values .	3.6289409020828893

For example , if we have two monomers and then copolymerize them in ball power solution , then compare their copolymerization behavior in heterogeneous polymerization system like emulsions or suspension .	2.432170011899732

Then , what happens there is some time , there is a possibility that one of the monomers will preferably partition in the core for say emulsion polymerization .	3.834065899880033

If the partition is more for one of the particular monomer , then that monomer will be available for copolymerization more , than the other monomer .	3.975964467504053

But , because their availability in terms of copolymerization is different , as a result , their partition ability in the reaction point or the reactor , then the r 1 and y 2 might be different , r 1 and y 2 could be different if the monomer structure changes .	3.4621419689383934

For example , if you have Carboxylic acid like acrylic acid and then compare its copolymerization behavior over acryl amide , then we change in ph of the medium .	2.4333062195121737

If there is acidic ph , for example , ph 2 , then acrylic acid remain as COH and if it is a basic ph like ph 9 , then we have a COO minus group .	2.7025530410352885

As a result , you have different monomers altogether .	4.525045641075105

You have the reactivity to be different , the r 1 and r 1 and r 2 values for acrylic acid would be different at different ph .	3.1705602311461925

If there , the copolymer is not soluble in the resulting monomer , then also there could be a complicated behavior of the 2 reactivity ratios .	4.066757395283482

Now , what we are going to discuss next is the Q and e scheme .	3.921780865959632

Now , because all these , there are 3 different type of effectives .	4.115342440644878

We have just studied resonance effect and polarity effect and steric effect , which might alter the reactivities of the different monomers .	2.7747397412064863

It is very difficult to predict .	8.282579341825764

They are very complicated .	8.845456818097361

So , what is done is a semi empirical scheme .	4.370417133398477

This Q e scheme , which basically takes care of the resonance stabilization and the polarity part and basically have values for different monomers and from that values , we can actually predict the copolymerization behavior of the 2 different pair of monomers .	2.9305969918784265

Now , what we will do in the next lecture ?	3.1853179407673133

We will start from this Q e scheme , briefly talk about this and briefly talk about the ionic copolymerization and very briefly on the application part of this copolymerization and start .	3.3179437705965515

Now , in the second half of that lecture , we will start the rising opening polymerization .	3.9264334978099833

Welcome back ; in this class , I will continue with the introduction of polymers .	4.1713392106232545

I will begin with classification of polymers .	4.787458750661327

Now , at the very beginning , you should remember that there has not been or still there is no single method for polymer classifications , which is generally accepted , but I will do , I will list all the various ways of classifying polymers .	2.5966430146382784

Now , I do not expect student to remember a question , how many ways a polymer can be classified , but students should be aware of the terminology , which are used in this various classifications , so that when they come across these terms , they should be able to relate the meaning of this term .	2.621124841045867

Let us start with the classifications .	6.556763386001678

Classifications can be done .	15.248085719727133

How ? Nowhere from a polymer is originated .	6.427946472742412

In the last class , I have said that polymers can be originated from a natural sources and I also said that those are minor class of polymers .	2.789600956502958

Majority of polymers are synthesized in the lab or in a plant from most cases , petroleum resources and some cases form natural resources .	3.2267691916919903

Natural resource derived monomers .	7.864956107924384

So , we can classify as a synthetic polymers .	4.788808334196703

The polymers , we synthesize in the lab or we can classify as a natural polymers in which case , polymers come from nature .	3.2466680294464902

For example , polysaccharides which represent cellulose , starch , cotton , biopolymers , proteins , nucleic acids , wool , silk and so on and say , natural rubber , cis - 1 , 4 - isopolyisoprene .	2.3326933880825

Those cases we can term those polymers as semi - synthetic or semi - natural in any of the ways .	3.544172599523665

So , third category could be semi - synthetic polymers , where chemically , which is chemically modified natural polymer .	2.49652197617046

Synthetic polymers can be classified as the organic polymers .	4.972795854882767

The polymers which are made from carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and hydrogen and as inorganic polymers , where beside this elements , carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , you have silicon , phosphorus , boron , sulphur , such elements in the polymer molecules for example siloxanes , silanes , silicon , phosphazenes .	2.4386093394101613

These are the examples of inorganic polymers .	5.967902177134679

Synthetic polymers can be classified as homochain and hetrochain polymers as well .	3.6399597534622643

Homochain polymers mean a polymer which has a backbone of only carbon CCC .	4.423980810255246

For example , polyethylene polypropylene , these are made of polymer .	4.490751476740122

The polymer chain consists of only CCC backbone , whereas in heterogen , in case of heterogen , besides carbon , you might have nitrogen , oxygen and other hetero atoms .	2.769684117334696

For example , nylon has nitrogen , oxygen along with carbon .	3.305285930070929

Polycarbonate has carbon plus oxygen in the backbone .	4.770741426655641

Polymers can be classified as according to the chain structure .	4.91086830476807

It can have linear chains like this .	4.566864776348281

It can have branch chains , like you have this linear polymer plus you have these branches .	3.7561854464160267

You can have branches like this or you can have branches like this as well .	4.463750657299992

Now , the main difference between these three branches chain in all are that all of these three are called branch chain polymers .	3.2138409128355563

In this case , the length of the branches is much smaller compared to the length between two branching points , whereas in this case , the length of the individual branches is comparable to the length between two branching points and in this case , branches also have sub branches .	3.195015783766475

So , in this case , we call this as short branched chain .	4.371900396101969

Short branch and this is long branch and this is hyper branch .	6.057123098594742

Now , special type of branching if you have polymer like this where branches is coming from a single point , you get a star polymer .	4.5786027807665

Now , you can also have network polymers .	6.544902848088186

For example , if I have different chains in polymers which are connected , covalently connected like this and so on , then this entire polymer is cross linked , so that this individual chain does not exist .	3.1023080974814055

If you take , if you move one chain , the entire network will come along with it and this is called polymer network or network polymer .	2.8894130815174304

Now , you can have a mixture of such networks .	5.9000345852292835

In a same sample , you have mixture of .	4.389109752870154

If you have mixture of two networks , then this network will penetrate with each other and then , we call this as interpenetrating network .	3.357785377356138

If I just show in some colors , different colors , you can have two networks inter twingled each other .	2.978909726613

So , you have interpenetrating network and in another case , you can have one of this network as link one of network along with long chain linear polymers .	2.7699840765382837

In that case , we call that system as a semi - interpenetrating network , where one of the constituents is linear chain polymer and another one is network polymers .	3.024463632080446

So , in that case , we call as a semi - interpenetrating and when both or more than one networks are inter twingled each other , then you call as interpenetrating network .	3.1482396642719506

Polymers can be classified according to the monomer compositions .	5.286353128315686

Homopolymer , if you have a monomer represented by and linked with each other , then we call as a homopolymer .	4.83163472527903

Example given is polystyrene and you know polymer made up of styrene and MMA .	4.466668048001167

Then , you can have copolymers .	11.594483187315756

Now , copolymers can be different molecular structures .	5.155908035157633

They can be present in the polymer chain randomly with no order , something like that where you do not have any order of placement between any orders of placement of the monomers .	3.326021565834849

They are present randomly .	8.266113849604327

They may call random copolymers .	5.894161335363916

If they are present alternatively , then we call alternating copolymer .	4.347658556019628

Now , if these two monomers are present like this where it is sort of combination of two small blocks of A and B , so it is like oligomer of A or polymer of A which is linked with oligomer or polymer of B .	2.9755455527745793

This is example of block copolymer and there is another version of the block copolymers , where you might have a backbone of homopolymer and so on and from which you may be hanging chains of another block , then we call this as a graft copolymers .	3.2735859478532716

You can extend this in 3 - D and have this as a brass polymer where you have a backbone , two dimension and these brasses are hanging from the base .	3.1260039521640572

So , you can have brass polymers and so on .	4.322647620104247

We can classify polymers as a chain configuration .	5.72069034433983

For example , if I take a monomer like this , it can make polymers in two ways and so on , where if this is head and this is a tail , then polymer is formed by linking between head and tail and so on .	3.2216048455016906

So , it is a head and tail .	6.528921048035633

Polymer or these polymers can be also imagined like this , where head and head is linked and a tail and tail will be linked to next monomers .	2.839171272060113

So , that is a head and head to head polymers .	3.963313996201459

Now , in practical sense , in most of the cases , you know exclusively almost every cases , when you synthesize a polymer , you get head or tail , head to tail polymers and you rarely get unless you make specific arrangement to make such a polymer , you don ’ t get head to head polymers .	2.5260066590375274

You can have polymers as geometric isomers like in this case cis - iso , poly - iso from all the monomers are arranged in a polymer in a cis arrangement .	3.4963921931287887

Now , you can have them in trans arrangement or a cis - trans arrangement as well .	3.0892289309199312

So , that gives you geometric or cis - trans isomerism isomers .	3.204674584347342

You can have stereoisomers or which you call in polymer term , different tacticity .	2.8510102869996006

So , if the repeating units have same stereochemistry , all the monomers , all the repeating units ’ chemistry called isotactic .	2.8942567073178385

If they are alternate one after one , then if you call syndiotactic and if there is no order , it is placed random and then , we call as atactic .	3.9725990196613297

Polymers can be classified as thermal behavior as well .	4.100246563205646

Now , you commonly think polymer you know where you can take polymer that make polymeric material and then , heat it .	3.277379781611642

On heating , it will become fluid and melt it and you give them a proper shape and cool them .	3.050628182156381

It will harden and occupy or get the shape you are looking for , a similar like a wax where you melt it and when it cools ; it takes up the shape of the container .	2.624658321814624

You place the wax and these are called thermoplastics .	4.848178295271666

Plastics is meaning formable .	8.190640797586227

So , it is polymeric materials which can be formed or can be transferred into different shapes by heating and subsequent cooling and this cycle can be done several times .	2.873927727226605

You can make a polymer of different shape and later on , if you melt it again by heating and again , you can reshape it , give it reshape , ok .	2.9092176125083244

So , that is this .	7.87981009289236

These polymers are recyclable .	8.467077315887913

Another class is thermosets , where a polymer is made in C2 .	4.187265441446583

You start with small molecules monomers as a low viscous to liquid and then , put it in a container and then , cure it by heating or doing some chemical reaction by that doing this reaction are by heating .	2.4468613307689386

It forms a cross linked network .	5.416902743535233

The terminologies I mentioned in last slide , last page where these polymer chains are networked .	3.936151666406749

They are cross linked and frozen .	5.875572039987282

So , once the polymer material has taken the shape of the container where we are doing the curing process , what happen is you cannot remelt it because they are cross linked .	3.3504628887775834

The polymers cannot be moved around with each other .	4.153841410424853

So , they cannot be molten , you know melted by heating .	3.728754069363793

So , they are frozen .	7.652899879900584

They are like having infinite molecular weight cross linked polymer network .	3.207676830168093

Thermoplastics can be amorphous or semi - crystalline .	4.965849357401317

In case of amorphous polymers , where polymer chains , long polymer chains are placed randomly with no order and in case of crystalline polymers , you have the chains placed in like a crystal .	3.4556098715029604

You know they are having a definite order .	5.495975987259509

We know the crystal ; the molecules are arranged in a definite order .	4.036221270060163

So , in a crystalline polymer , you have the polymer chains placed in definite order , but it is impossible or it is highly unlikely that you can make a perfectly crystalline 100 percent crystalline polymers because polymer chains are very large and they are flexible .	4.137802063342099

It is almost impossible to align all the chains one after to make a 100 percent or perfect crystalline polymers .	3.340355971269206

So , we are going to talk about crystalline polymers .	5.2523097078875045

There is a mixture of a crystalline region and amorphous regions which do not have any order .	3.7828961572870785

So , in more technical sense , it is called a semi - crystalline polymer .	4.1133741881906065

Semi - crystalline polymer means a polymer having both crystalline regions and amorphous regions .	3.6196197738084552

Amorphous polymers are mostly clear and crystalline because this domain , crystalline domains will scatter light .	2.679071741829541

They are depending upon the extent of crystalline and they can become translucent or opaque as well .	3.6932766147452494

We will talk about this in little detail later .	4.768166672072708

We will talk about the polymer properties , thermosets which we talked about in the last page .	4.833678449690393

They can be glassy or elastomer .	4.7851882279054685

As I said , they are cross linked network and if these chains between networks , they have flexibility which happens if the temperature at which they are is above their glass transition temperature .	2.73441211295522

I will talk about glass transition later in more detail but at present , just glass transition means temperature at which they becomes flexible , ok .	2.8045773591953194

Now , if these chains are flexible in the temperature you are working , then they can be stretched and as soon as you remove the stress , they will come back to the original form .	3.5157815497576506

So , it is like rubber .	7.424107538134419

So , you have a elastomer .	8.832334394373806

Now , if these chains are below the glass transient temperature , that means they do not have any flexibility in the temperature operation , then you cannot stretch the polymer because they do not have any flexibility in the thermal motion you talking about .	2.9861249251159436

So , you cannot stress .	8.105217843393838

So , they are like glassy thermosets .	5.728397524773907

Polymer can be classified according to the applications .	6.1233874031984135

They can be plastics , fiber or elastomer .	4.076380308869208

If they are defined more from a stress strain curve from the mechanical properties , if I plot strain versus stress or a polymer sample , then elastomers are like small strain , the small stress .	2.7607129746458074

You can strain the polymer samples much more .	5.109292561893479

You know how the rubber works .	5.849334115557244

So , this is like elastomer .	7.48027661788976

With a small stress , you can strain the sample much more fibers is the extreme case .	2.7802509912471844

Other case , other side you take these fibers and strain it .	3.75522660026815

That means to stretch it little bit , you have to apply very high stress .	3.5586132895118103

So , you have situation something like this .	4.42289794233281

So , to strain a fiber , you have to apply a very high stress .	4.988074666855917

For plastics are somehow in between this is fiber elastomers and this is plastic .	3.9880628983061346

Now , after sometime , plastics yields i will talk about more about this term and it becomes easy to strain if you have this .	3.7181034236412107

You have to give a lot of force , but once it starts stretching , that means the samples yielded .	3.7037623319767166

Then , it becomes quite easy .	7.042818648329025

So , that is an example of plastic which gives away this type of stress strain curve .	3.9917551938386597

We will talk about this more when we come back to the mechanical properties of the polymers .	4.338543628061597

Polymers , according to the applications , they can be named or classified as coating gels and additives and so on .	3.1770090339739974

These are basically depending up on the applications where you are the polymers is find the application .	4.523203349452238

Based volume , performance and price polymers can be also categorized in two class , three classes .	3.145683629041045

Commodity polymers you know the polymers which you see in a real life in all the times , the bottles , buckets , shoes , clothes and all these things , they are having much volume used heavily and so , the prices are low and performance is also not so good compared to the others classes of polymers .	2.972332414386253

Other two is engineering polymers and high performance polymers and if the price in these three , the volume goes up like this .	2.9102898095696483

More volume for commodity polymers , performance goes up in this direction .	3.4748489415204387

The high performance polymers are having the highest performance and so does the price .	3.3622316159079526

You know nothing comes cheap .	5.796138300585123

So , as you get more performance from a polymer , you have to pay for more .	4.37983314517757

So , prices also go up .	6.325958453268916

Now , I will come to the most important classification of polymers .	5.182872893269029

This is last and most important .	6.068794581736009

It is based on the polymerization mechanism and the reaction product .	8.16767481800066

Depending upon the reaction product , you can classify polymers as addition polymers or condensation polymers and depending upon mechanism of the polymerization , the process by which polymers are synthesized ; it can be classified as chain step polymers or chain - growth and step - growth polymers .	3.322984258287012

This term addition and condensation , this classification is originally proposed by Carothers in 1929 and as name suggests , the condensation polymers are synthesized by condensation reactions of the monomers , you know condensation in organic chemistry .	2.540450758729274

Condensation reaction means a reaction between two molecules and subsequent elimination of small molecules .	3.4688798139724044

We are talking about making ester between acid and alcohol .	3.9824045350101134

You make ester , a removal of a water molecule .	3.939683268417616

So , the condensation polymers are the polymers where you make or the polymers are synthesized by condensation reaction between the monomers .	4.525314332798155

For example , if I take , I will just give you a write a general way .	4.205535100818727

Now , so if I have plus these two reacts , n molecules of this and n combination of this , it will give you polyesters .	3.561090614813341

To give you more example , I take , I want to make polyamides .	4.414409687153205

So , I take this molecule and n molecules of this which gives .	4.374587289455303

See , in both the examples , in the last case when we made polyester or in this case we are making polyamides , we have this elimination of this small molecule in this case water .	4.21987205852804

Remember the last class we talked about synthesis of polycarbonate from phosgene and based , where the compound or the small molecules which eliminated what hcl .	3.091466638452785

So , all these are examples of condensation polymers , where the polymer is made from condensation reaction of the monomers .	4.306225380776207

Now , in this particular case , forming polyamides you can make this from diamine and diacids .	3.4490782799392745

This can also be made from another variation of these monomers like diamines and diacyl chloride .	3.464278400612294

You can land up in same polymer along with different small molecules or it can be , these polyamides can be synthesized by self condensation amino acids which will make polypeptides .	3.175655850373811

So , same type of polymers .	7.332213261043362

In this case , polyamides can be synthesized by different set of monomers or self condensation of amino acids .	3.230679110621931

Now , what in addition ?	8.398795107152269

Polymers , they are defined as the polymers which are synthesized by addition reaction .	5.726583481022844

You know additional reaction means where monomers are just adding with each other and making polymers without elimination of small molecules .	2.623358790566453

Now , this nature polymers , say like cellulose , how do you define which class they belong ?	3.185134542277141

Whether this addition polymers or a condensation polymers because they are not synthesized in the lab , so we do not know the constituent from or the monomers from which are the type of reaction is condensation reaction on a addition reaction by which they are synthesized , but looking at the structure , what we can anticipate or we can imagine or we can hypothesize , monomers form which they have been synthesized , they can be synthesized in the lab or in other words , the polymers can be degraded to some other small monomers , monomeric molecules , hypothetical monomeric molecules from which this can be synthesized .	3.234868351690832

Now , I will give a proper structure , so that you get .	5.205149788953992

Now , this is cellulose .	7.961804318208286

Now , it can be degraded easily to this poly molecule which is nothing , but glucose .	4.263672560691068

Now , these two polymers condensation and addition polymers , they are often used synonymously with chain growth and step - growth polymers because most of the condensation polymers are synthesized by chain growth polymer mechanism , and addition polymers are made through a chain polymerization mechanism , but this is not always the case .	3.1267668357735308

Students should not confuse , should not equate the terms with addition polymers with chain polymers or condensation polymers with step - polymers .	2.5973816811555857

Now , next example of polyurethane .	6.375924363264411

Polyurethane can be synthesized from diol and di isocyanate .	4.1983387857344985

So , this is a polyurethane which is synthesized from diol and di isocyanate .	3.3867475867766155

Now , what do you call this as addition polymer or a condensation polymer ?	4.416777470908742

According to a organic chemistry definition , this is addition reaction .	3.4506208859801673

This is not a condensation reaction , but if you compare this polymer along with another condensation polymers , they have similar backbone structure , like if you compare with polycarbonate , this has this structure .	3.6072883116412258

If you talk about polyester , we have this .	5.334385572586077

You talk about amide , you have this .	5.751576119309123

So , this structure , the functionality in the backbone , they are much more similar with your condensation polymers rather than the addition polymers .	3.2438642469097627

Most addition polymer have a backbone of carbon , so according to the definition of addition polymers , it should be addition polymers and not the original definition of addition polymers .	3.1606227072942703

It should be addition polymers , not a condensation polymers , but you can itself justify it being a condensation polymers , rather than a addition polymer .	2.9625464392432845

So , the original definition of addition and condition polymers are modified and now , the condensation polymers are polymers where you have a functional group like this z , where z could be any of this .	2.9700592757208466

It could be oxygen , ether , it could be ester , it could be amide or it would be any of these things , ok .	3.9477979828809233

So , the original definition of addition and condensation polymers where addition was polymers which are made from addition reaction .	2.8675575043008372

Condensation polymers were the polymers which were synthesized from the monomers by condensation reaction got modified and now , condensation reaction is where the polymer contain or a functional group at the backbone .	3.1103554364220716

You can have a general representation of the backbone structure like this , where z represents any of the functional groups we talked about and any polymer which does not have this structure , we call them as addition reaction .	3.8131896702011425

Now , that did not solve the entire problem .	3.8435054941366564

If we give next example , then that will be clear .	4.646536245312193

We talked about very old phenol plus formaldehyde reaction .	3.1426291088905365

This gives a polymer like this , ok .	5.604485085463177

Now , with the original definition of addition and condensation polymers , you will definitely classify as a condensation reaction because in this reaction , small molecules are coming out .	3.0549297567191007

So , this polymer is formed by condensation reaction , but the definition we came up in the last few minutes back where condensation polymers at this represented by this anything else are called addition polymers .	2.802249685355473

We talked about the backbone of these polymers .	6.603035164007484

This is the back bone .	7.660248808562086

So , this is the backbone .	7.923373499222232

In this case , what do you see here ?	5.40978827972474

There is no functional group in the backbone .	5.2383960517547115

These are all carbon .	8.503004461535546

So , according to the definition , just now it should be a addition polymer and not a condensation polymer , but you can clearly see that given a choice , you will probably classify this is more of a condensation polymer rather than addition polymers .	2.8032813853734013

So , now the definition is the classification is done by summation with conditions .	3.5822936050278797

For example , condensation polymers are polymers which fulfill any of this criteria .	4.209415799584423

One made for condensation reaction or it has functional group in the backbone or it can be degraded to hypothetical monomers from which they can be synthesized .	3.9520212743708933

At least imagine that they are formed by condensation reaction or by elimination of some small molecules , and if any of the polymers does not fulfill any of these criteria , then we call them as addition polymers .	3.4493640196322075

So , once again at present , you should classify condensation polymers .	3.3518457252197207

If it fulfills any of the conditions , it is synthesized by condensation reaction or it has a function group in the backbone or you can imagine that it has been synthesized from monomers by elimination of small molecules , and if any of polymers which does not fulfill any of these criteria , we classify that as addition polymers .	3.285084679379324

Now , we will come to the mechanism of polymerization .	6.03043401772322

These two type of polymer , this classification chain growth and step - growth polymers , you take an example like I took in the class .	2.9314564584126863

I can write a general structure like this .	5.95927275333212

CH Y CH 2 gives polymers .	6.327365299670692

Now , how do you think that these polymers are formed ?	5.443078650578129

So , you need an initiator , whether the initiator is radical or cation or an anion , it has to initiate the chain .	3.721167750764554

So , if you react with say this is initiator , you get an active centre here and on which the second monomer gets added and you have this .	3.5864185507493365

Don ’ t consider this dot .	6.580101356231327

So , how these polymers are getting formed ?	6.099555096485575

Either the active centre on which next monomer is getting added and third monomer will be added in there .	3.4009687519438407

So , you have this type of polymers are getting formed in a chain reaction .	5.386832087816192

Now , in a normal case , in general case , the formation of this active species , they are much lower compared to this step which basically is the propagation step of the polymers by which the chain is formed which means as soon this active species initiates , this is formed , it initiates and the chain formation is completed .	3.437880208504761

I will come to more detail how this gets terminated and all these things , but for time being , we should understand that as soon as this in more often as soon as this active centre is generated , it reacts initiate the chain and the chain is formed .	2.8928785653311984

So , the more and more active centers , more and more initiator gets generated in a system , more and more chain form , so if I plot conversation , say percentage conversation means the fraction of monomers is reacted or this appeared from the reaction medium with the molecular weight or the size of the chain or a size .	3.3506660274856936

What do we expect with time conversion is , also you can write time , you know with more time .	3.6542744346138933

Let us talk about conversion now .	5.824166705377103

So , at the beginning when this initiator is formed , in most cases they said that it immediately start the activation and initiation and then , complete the chain .	3.243807402995808

So , you have large molecule at the beginning itself .	5.671075818929025

You have a large molecular weight .	6.985045138300288

The more and more this initiator generates in the system , active species more and more chain gets .	4.305522187648964

So , at very beginning itself , you get a high polymer , very high molecular weight polymer in the system and more and more active species get generated , more and more monomers reacts .	4.043766111951041

So , more and more polymer chains are formed .	6.868202769706379

So , what is happening here ?	6.920604159216856

More and more reactor you get such the number of such polymer chains increases with conversion .	3.8509562195023443

The more conversation means more number of chains .	6.332868253715565

Polymer chains are getting formed ; it is not the molecular weight increases .	7.434994727220397

So , with conversion , more and more polymers chains are getting formed .	4.430583985445246

So , if I stop , say the reactions somewhere here after 10 percent conversion or 5 percent conversion , what do you see ?	2.919500381560991

What do we expect in the system mixture ?	5.839224563195862

5 percent conversion , that means 90 monomers are left in the system .	4.114086663446664

So , you get plenty of monomers , 95 percent monomers .	3.7590379721221563

What about the fate of that 5 percent monomers which got converted , no which got reacted ?	2.701222619757873

This is all most all of them as formed belong chain polymers .	3.3843682966947317

So , along with that 95 of monomer present in the system , we get the other part as a long chain polymer molecules .	4.668094767903294

If you stop here as a 95 percent level , then you see lot of polymer , large chain polymers and the small amount of monomers and the left over initiators , ok .	3.0291897444239475

Now , I go to the step growth polymers , and then come back later to compare between these two .	4.510416523518235

Now , say I take a monomer NH2 , say RNAH2 R dash COH CO OH forming polyamides .	2.8243914542457937

This is diamines and this is diacids .	7.812275364846309

These two monomers can react by itself .	6.131850218742964

It does not need any external initiator like chain polymers .	3.8584870821709525

Now , how this will react ?	7.708196329817114

How do you form polymers ?	6.377792805317131

First , this will react .	10.939119797639671

Two monomers will react and form like this , species like this .	4.013516004382393

So , this is dimer .	7.444833283690968

Now , this dimer , the choice of reacting with itself or has a choice of reacting with any of the two monomers , if it reacted with this , so you get a BB , again AA .	3.247857142488499

If it reacts with this , if it reacts with this , then you get BB AA and BB , ok .	3.65716820303119

Now , if it reacts with itself , then you get BB AA BB .	3.938714521066013

So , you form these trimers .	6.066763325778588

This is a trimer consists of monomer molecules and this is tetramer consists of four monomer units or structural units .	3.255785955369261

Now , once you form the trimer , the options increases .	3.6020739896399343

It can react with monomer .	8.299879077626684

It can react with any of the dimmers or it can react with the trimer itself making the possibilities more and more .	4.15830768598097

If it reacts with monomer , it will form tetramer .	5.266830705222303

If reacts with dimer , it will form pentamer .	5.270371435732949

If it reacts with itself , it will form hexamer .	5.058655177013777

Imagine , once you form the tetramer , what will happen ?	4.19711149587779

It reacts with monomer , dimer , trimer and itself forming dimer , forming pentamer , hexamer , heptamer and so on .	2.464687096342827

So , in the chain reaction , you have the long polymer chain at the beginning itself .	5.922607238702042

In this case , you are not getting long polymer chain at the beginning .	4.082702343285389

What you are getting is the polymer chains are forming in steps , dimer , trimer and tetramer and because these monomers can react this function group , so they will react immediately .	3.4668123457963684

So , the conversion of polymer , conversion of monomers will be very high , even at the beginning forming dimer , tetramer or these small oligomers .	3.772976385504739

So , what happen is only at the last , at the end of the polymerization , you will see a long polymer chain are forming , unlike the chain polymers where you have even a small conversion , you get a larger polymer .	3.4893875054688914

So , in the next class , I will continue with this condensation polymers , and talk about the , compare between or the difference between chain polymers and chain growth polymers and step growth polymers .	3.6854227531146635

Then , it will become more clear the difference in the mechanism of these polymers to polymerization medium .	4.811231393626175

In next class , also I will talk about , continue with the introduction , more talk about the , we will talk about the nomenclature .	4.036115655200988

You have learned that the polymers have larger molecular weight and invariably , either of these synthetic processes you land up in distribution of molecular .	3.1398825802240604

Not all the polymer chains are of same size or same molecular weight .	4.042894617977428

They will be of different molecular size and I will talk about the molecular weight ; why you need more definition of molecular weight and so on .	4.063058340459369

So , we will come back to the next class with this .	5.066926332744339

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

We will continue our discussion on step - growth polymerization which we were having in last lecture .	3.8369411154147683

Now , let us look at what we have learnt so far in terms of step - growth polymerization .	4.292965654444336

We have learnt the mechanism of step - growth polymerization and its comparison over chain polymers , and we also learnt how and what is the effect of equal reactivity of functional group , and we also understood the justification of why the functional group of reacting molecules including the intermediate species should have same reactivity irrespective of their size and irrespective of whether the functional group present in the other direction is already reacted or not .	2.9530285505602136

Also , we have seen that this is experimentally proven that once the length of the chain goes beyond 3 , then the reactivity actually becomes independent of the chain length of the oligomeric species .	3.7787269213840666

We also learnt the Carothers equation relating to the average degrees of polymers , polymerization and the conversion p , and we also same time learnt how to get the number of average molecular weight from the degree , average degrees of polymerization and I give more time in this because as I said that sometimes , there are confusion among students how to get m n from x n .	3.0249629686532766

It is actually m n is x n multiplied by the average molecular weight of the structural unit , not the repeat unit and we also discussed the kinetics of step polymerization .	3.8691259070264308

In this class , in this lecture , what we will do is we will continue the discussion on kinetics of step polymerization and then , go for predicting the number average degrees of polymerization for a step - polymerization which is happening in a close system , and that will give us the importance of equilibrium constant of a step polymerization reaction .	3.9655635396432762

We then move to a step polymerization in a open and driven system , where it is not possible to completely remove the condensate out of the system .	3.5477211080442212

That means there will be some condensate remaining in the system , polymerization system .	5.292990371170193

In that case , what is the consequence of that presence of the condensate on the molecular weight of the polymer and then , we will move to the different strategies of how to control the molecular weight in the polymerization .	4.648807635751448

Now , let us go back and see what we have learnt in the last class in terms of kinetics of poly step polymerization .	3.5318740193376557

Now , this is the reaction .	10.769837980275422

We took as our model the polyesterification reaction and this is the reaction we followed and finally , what we arrived at is as follows .	3.1359635490954703

That for self catalyzed reaction x n bar is 1 plus 2 n square k t , where n 0 is the concentration of the monomeric species at beginning , whereas for external catalyzed reaction , we got x n is 1 plus n 0 k dash t .	2.8165659775872736

Now , from these two equations , we have seen in the last class itself that and it is very difficult to build a high molecular weight , high value of x n bar for a self catalyzed reaction and that is the reason in most cases , in a most industrial polymerization has taken place in presence of a catalyst which is added from outside the system .	3.7262015548700806

So , most of the reactions in industrial setup are carried out in external catalyzed reaction .	3.92524719389221

So , our discussion in our discussion , we will be mainly focusing on this external catalyzed reaction and we will not discuss too much about the self catalyzed reaction .	4.010632862915595

Now , let us take an experimental observation of an external catalyzed system .	3.241389046038412

One , experimental observation .	12.54099139059497

Let us consider reaction adipic acid plus diethylene glycol at 190 degree centigrade in presence of 0.4 mol percent of para toluene sulphonic acid as a catalyst and the product is polyester plus h 2 o .	2.8914433380662747

This is 99 , this is somewhere 98 and in this side , we have x n bar which is equals to 1 by 1 by p and experimental , it has been found to the following something like this .	3.339505957958797

Now , what do we see here in this experimental observation ?	4.490455566993424

We see that except this initial part , the entire region for the entire conversional region , you have a linear relationship of degrees , average degrees of polymerization with time which is predicted by your reaction mechanism .	2.830278607189019

Now , what does it mean ?	4.592161118776184

Now , remember the reaction .	8.525261250532072

How do the go about the reaction ?	4.474862565984361

Now , in during that deduction of that kinetic equation expression , we have used functional group like this which means we have considered the reactivity of functional group independent of the size of the molecules and here , it found to be that expression is valid for almost entire range of conversion region , which means that this assumption what we have considered here , that equal reactivity of the functional group is valid even experimentally .	3.2821754202273805

So , even if at high conversion , the length of the polymer chain or the oligomer chains are quite high .	3.8335079643670884

The reactivity of the concern group at the end of that residing , at the end of the chain are same as when the conversion was smaller .	3.71481196128693

Now , remember what are the other conditions we have assumed or imposed during the derivation of this expression was that there is one is to one stoichiometric composition of two monomers or two functional groups .	3.5643859021894087

In this case , carboxylic acid and OH and also , we were taking out this condensate , this small molecule , so that practically the reaction is irreversible .	2.9514839941638122

We are taking out the condensate small molecules h 2 o in this case to make sure that the reaction happened .	4.325128718713698

This equilibrium reaction actually happens almost irreversibly .	4.3830473087637465

For p is 0.98 or 98 percent which correspondence to x n bar of 50 t is say , around 450 minutes .	3.2475913855442218

Now , for p , 0.99 or 99 percent x n corresponding to 100 and t is almost 85 .	3.19748182017026

So , we see here that from reaching up to 98 percent conversion , it takes about 450 minutes and build a average degree of polymerization of 50 .	2.595279956275958

If the average molecular of the structural units is 200 , then the molecular weight will be above 10,000 .	4.54601545008897

Now , that may not be sufficient for our purpose .	4.958552995059296

We are looking for building high molecular weight for all practical purpose .	5.58142650045582

We need high molecular weight , so this 98 percent conversion may not be sufficient for our , it will not serve our purpose .	4.114250830185919

So , we must push the conversion higher , so that the molecular weight we get is high enough for which will serve our purpose .	3.4045188562166286

So , from 98 , conversion going to 99 percent conversion , we have to almost double the reaction type , some 450 to 850 .	3.132029146662425

So , for a organic chemist which is doing a stratification reaction for small molecules , a 98 percent conversion may be quite satisfactory which means that at 450 minutes time , he can stop the reaction and take the product which is 98 percent conversion which is quite sufficient and quite satisfactory , but for a polymer chemist , that 90 percent conversion is not sufficient .	2.774691664700101

You know there is no choice for a polymer chemist other than continues the reaction for almost similar time to get a high enough molecular weight .	3.6027040667673846

In this case , x n bar degrees of polymerization of 100 and if this molecular is not sufficient enough , then you have to keep the reaction even longer to high the conversion and hence , higher the molecular weight of the polymers .	3.3322146364100695

Now , because you have to keep this reaction for longer time , sometimes that actually posses some difficulties in terms or stability of the ingredients , the chemical species which is present and as you have seen that this is typically done at higher temperature , which means that if you keep this for a longer time , there is the possibility of the polymer x species might degrade and form colour species which is not desired .	3.6082578667277434

What we also have seen this from this equation that the x n bar is linearly dependent on the initial monomer concentration as well , which means that to increase for a given rate constant , it is always referred to use a high concentration of monomer and that is why , typically this reaction are done at very high concentration in solution or in some cases , they are done in a bulk .	3.695991479336778

So , we now move to that .	5.218164702787282

This again , this was deduced for such a way that we are taking out the condensate , in this case H 2 molecules , so that reaction was almost irreversible reaction .	3.9062144685082534

Now , let us consider a close system and take that we will write this reaction and reaction is constant .	3.675715738978404

So , equilibrium constant can be written as now , if the conversion is P , if the conversion at equilibrium is say P e in this case and m 0 is the monomer concentration at the beginning at t is equal to 0 , then at the equilibrium what is the concentration of COH is P m 0 .	3.9189813052999285

Initially , it was n 0 .	9.048012560493364

Now , P e m 0 has reacted .	5.852023073861142

So , at equilibrium , the concentration of COH group is given by 1 minus P e and because we are talking about one is to one stoichiometric ratio here as well , this is same as the concentration of OH at equilibrium .	3.7758751832888664

What is the concentration of CO group and H 2 O at equilibrium ?	4.620562044043876

That is P e m 0 .	6.586977585792715

It gives you 1 plus root k .	5.268030989738627

Now , remember the difference between the earlier case and this case .	5.642202084421181

In this case , we are doing or we are carrying out the reaction in a close system which means none of the reactants or the products are taken out from the system , and reaction is allowed to reach a equilibrium and from this reaction , we now can say that this is the formula which relates an average degree of polymerization with the equilibrium constant .	3.431311217175914

So , how this translates to the real number , let us look at this following data .	3.361316209711484

These are all calculated data from this expression .	4.447399655578991

I will try to explain what it means in a minute .	4.038576027498077

Now , if we carry out this reaction in a close system , if the equilibrium constant k you say 1 , then the equilibrium conversion would be 0.5 and which will lead to degrees of polymerization , average degrees of polymer of 2 .	3.6326619884865226

That means , if our reaction is such a way that your equilibrium constant is the value of equilibrium constant is 1 , then at the end of the reaction that mean at the equilibrium , you are only going to get dimers .	3.6555801909550127

If you want to build a molecular weight that means , if you want to build say a degree of polymerization of 100 in a close system , then your equilibrium conversion has to be 0.9 which means your key has to be almost in the order of 10 to the power of 4 .	3.5609831891275676

That means by itself your reaction has to be very highly reactive , so that by itself without removing the byproduct , you can get the product .	3.53813575675031

If you talk about a degree of polymerization 200 , say this is probably the number we look for .	3.907042463023884

When you make a high molecular weight polymer , then your equilibrium conversion has to be 0.995 which means you have to look at the number of k , value of k which is at the order of 10 to 5 .	4.607765639772102

That means your reaction has to be very much towards the product side , reactivity has to be very high , which is seldom the case , which is not the common case normally .	4.007585996243711

Typically , polyesterification , they have the order of a 0.1 to 10 poly aberration of the order of which probably is the highest among the known reacts .	3.3268192800284258

Typical , common reaction is about the 10 to the power of 2 transesterification reaction of the order of 1 to 10 .	4.371362182800849

It will be at the stage of x n above 10 .	4.470021041490169

So , that gives the importance of the equilibrium constant in a reaction in a step polymerization reaction that you always prefer .	4.769650961904039

You always have a better reaction on your hand which is having a high equilibrium constant .	3.5919424975574303

So , this convinces that we have to , there is no other way .	5.990090242978752

We have to do a reaction where we always continuously take out the condensate from the system .	3.9775018303295413

Now , what happened if we take out the products is it will be moved towards right hand side .	4.427419692748836

So , polymer will build , but it is not always possible or it is almost impossible for engineering design to take out every possible condensate , you know all the 100 percent with condensate .	3.170372781184957

In this case , H 2 O for a polyesterification reaction , it is not possible to take out all the 100 percent H 2 O which is evolved .	3.3331841070982895

See because of so many reasons .	6.301883923052422

Because of the high of in the molecular when it build up , there are high molecular weight .	3.353372800331024

Then , the viscosity of the medium goes , you know increases quite a lot and when the viscosity goes up , this small molecular condensate diffusion of the condensate becomes very slow .	3.1288379880933923

Now , to take out that H 2 molecule or any other condensate from the reaction , it has to first come to the surface .	4.968832699329593

Then only , they can suck out that molecule from the system , but if it is forming inside the reaction in first , it has to defuse out to the surface of your reaction medium and then only , it will go up of the system .	3.6597469622756273

So , it becomes you know lot of cases .	4.237207258432175

If the molecular weight is quite high and viscosity is very high which is you know more often the case .	4.841946874212128

In case of bulk polymerization that melts when you are talking about no solvent , only the monomer molecules , it becomes very difficult .	3.2787869049942238

That means reaction almost becomes diffusion control .	4.363623856232136

So , what we now know that it is almost difficult to take out entirely the small condensate .	4.2568072035898865

So , we should consider a open and driven system where there is a incomplete removal of our condensate material .	3.1001034410384296

So , we will consider the same reaction here in this reaction and in this case , which will come the H 2 .	5.499603721720708

We will take out .	8.584296930966104

It is taken out , but not all of them have been taken out of system .	4.052249611819483

It will be part of it or trace of which will be remaining .	4.842921983316354

So , how we write the equilibrium constant in that case ?	6.631013725769985

So , same thing P e m 0 .	5.32910843139806

Now , in this case , we do not know what is the concentration of H 0 H2O .	4.974534465132686

So , we are writing like this and again , m 0 1 minus P m 0 1 minus p which makes this .	3.5905154833012496

Now , we know x n is 1 by 1 minus P .	4.37428929562572

So , this can be written as let me write once again .	5.335013768441888

So , what is finally , k comes p .	3.920182463073302

Here , we are choosing to write P instead of P equilibrium because the two equilibriums have not been reached because we are taking out the system .	2.6795424567158133

So , instead of P equilibrium , in last case we are writing P as the conversion .	3.893521730443254

So , let us continue with the next page which means x n .	3.925482792304098

Now , most cases as we learned by now that for a high molecular weight polymer , P is close to 1 .	3.4315388188572347

So , we can ignore this for time being for if the molecular weight is high enough , so we can write .	4.583759097457557

So , what does it mean ?	4.958483279697328

This means that the x n , the number wise molecular weight is inversely proportional to the square root of the amount of condensate present .	3.6079293373830903

If I make a table with the corresponding numbers , how does it look ?	3.098076765204019

Now , to get it , we are trying to get x n bar of 100 .	4.23626651606964

How this k and H2 is related ?	5.468957726647717

What does this table means ?	6.658596275735043

The table means that if you have a reaction with high k to build same molecular weight , in this case average degrees of polymerization of 100 we are considering average degrees of polymers as 100 to reach that level , to reach that molecular weight .	4.041710051109875

If your k is higher , then you can afford to keep some of the water molecules in the system .	4.684813430747819

If your k is low , then you have to make sure that you takeout the water molecules as much as possible .	3.577914118554311

So , to reach at level of 100 degrees of polymers , you have to reach a concentration level of water molecules as low as these , 10 to the minus 4 order whereas , if you have 10 to the 2 order of k , you can leave with 10 to the power of minus 2 level of H 2 in the system .	3.2613025992318043

Now , as I said that it is not possible always to take out the entire amount of condensate through the system .	3.5865582821978528

So , in that case , what happened is the next alternate way .	4.129185669267923

You can build high molecular weight .	5.893644038691946

The alternative way is to design reactions , where k will be high because if k is high , then you can afford to keep some of the condensate molecule in the system and still build a high enough molecular weight .	3.3862126854203525

Now , as I said before that for engineer , it is not always very easy to build a reactor where you know you can take out the condensate molecules to the level , where you want for the building of molecular weight .	3.1925026179223317

So , in that case , there is a limitation , there is a limit at which you can take out the condensate from a system .	4.836529243091659

So , what happened if there is a limit up to which you can go down in H2O level ?	4.448169834111499

You have to increase .	10.762039983903785

The chemist would have to design a reaction which will be inherently having high equilibrium constant .	4.106386823065148

Let us take an example .	5.674002681604373

It will clarify more .	7.967604129374444

In one of the last lectures or previous lectures , so in the synthesis of polycarbonate form , this phenol , a using phosgene .	3.221638241908227

Now , there is another way of synthesizing polycarbonate is by transesterification of this phenol with a diphenol carbonate in presence of base catalyst , base as a catalyst that gives us phenol as by product .	2.4315964967140675

Now , in this reaction , the phenol boiling point is 180 degrees centigrade , bp of phenol is 180 degree centigrade .	2.7314364694010753

So , you can imagine that you have to at least have a reaction temperature of 180 , so that you can take out the phenol vapor from the system .	3.9717552177202027

Now , the key of this reaction , equilibrium reaction if you are around close to one which means that if you do this reaction in a close system without taking out phenol from the system , you land up in an average degrees of polymer of two .	3.7017848425741877

It will land up in a , demerit will land up in a diametric state .	3.889898949481468

So , naturally its reaction is done such a way that phenol is taking out from the system and reaction is done at very high temperature .	3.5591504061192567

So , the viscosity is lower and lower , so that you can take out the phenol molecule .	4.958600182344856

Now , you have to increase the temperature slowly because as you build up the molecular weight as the reaction goes , the viscosity of the medium builds .	4.777274036858878

So , to take out the mineral molecule , you have to make the viscosity lower .	5.072647820471471

So , you increase the temperature again and when you increase the temperature , again the time goes up ; again the molecular weight builds up .	4.517679360379696

So , it is a serial process .	6.536833498864498

It is a consequence of a process .	4.8060234942582545

So , here to build a molecular weight , if I consider this same as H 2 O , case in last line in the last page , this k is 1 .	3.6869601527817633

So , to build a x n of 100 , the phenol concentration should be of 5.05 into 10 to the power minus 4 mol per liter to understand because the equilibrium consent of this reaction is roughly one to build a molecular having a degrees of polymers of 100 .	2.821403922891943

You have to bring down the phenol level in the system to such a low level , but as I said that sometimes , it is limited by the design of the reactor , it is not possible .	3.801194219406503

So , the chemical engineer will come to a chemist that you design a reaction by which you can increase the key .	3.9657979917540382

Now , how can you do that ?	5.444496139590353

What is the mechanism of the reaction ?	8.082696867286286

Mechanism of the reaction is that you have a base catalyst reaction , so you have this molecule addicting to this carbonate group nucleophilic attack and the reaction starts from there .	4.4847311658045905

So , how do you increase the reactivity of this reaction ?	7.941125082646361

Let us see one of the strategies in the next page .	5.578825840019029

Now , if this is the lipophilic center , if we increase the electrophilicity of this carbon , then the attack of that phenolate coming from this phenolate group will be more feasible .	3.393079988342948

So , equilibrium constant how it is achieved ?	5.809445402137816

If you increase photo electron withdrawing group , then the attack of this , the nucleophilic attack of this phenolate ion becomes much more feasible which will increase the k much higher compared to a di phenol carbonate , where there was no electron withdrawing group .	2.7753597729254493

So , in this case , you can afford to keep this condensate at a much higher level compared to just phenol which we shown that that reaction equilibrium constant was 1 .	2.632110468466193

So , this one example where chemical engineers is restricted by the limitation of the reactor design , where the condensate can be taken out to a limited level , but still that will be not be sufficient to build up the molecular weight , enough molecular weight .	2.879436414759172

I just showed one example in this page .	5.065338975002138

Now , one thing you have to also remember is to build high molecular weight .	4.326660061627811

You have to make sure of some other conditions .	5.576910813353451

For example , you have to make sure that the functional groups are available during the entire reaction , so that some cases what happen you know these are exceptional case , where when you build a molecular weight after some size , it might feasibly turn the solution or from the melt of the reaction .	2.8038491355876727

So , you have to make sure that all the functional groups that mean all the monomeric species are the oligomeric species .	3.5673196288174376

They stay in the solution or in the reaction medium all the time during the reaction and here also , there are some exceptional cases that this equal reactivity or the functional group does not apply , but we are not talking about those cases in this course because they are exceptional cases and most of you know all those common reactions and the reactions we come across always follow this rule of a equal reactivity of the functional group .	3.270178105046078

So , we move to the next topic .	5.84067660983453

How do you control the molecular weight ?	5.050061578142274

So , strategy is for controlling in a step polymerization .	4.219254508679754

Now , why do we need to control a molecular weight of a step polymer ?	5.301473517170357

Now , if you see I am targeting a molecular weight of something which correspondence to an average degrees of polymerization of 100 .	3.4657153302881185

Now , if we land up at the end of the reactions something higher than 100 , then also problem .	3.8934693082480516

If we land up a number which is lower than 100 , then also a problem .	4.104849331569997

If it is lower than the polymer , it will not be serving our purpose and if it is higher , then it will pose a lot of other problems like taking the polymer and processing for the application will be difficult because the main viscosity of this polymer is higher .	3.63940964141649

So , handling will be difficult .	7.123568773544363

This is one example of the difficulties if you have higher molecular weight than the targeted one .	4.408259942297685

So , it is always desirable to have your reaction stopped or at the end of the reaction , you get whatever you target it for .	2.9546686006787923

So , you target for 100 is always desirable that at the end of the reaction , you should get an average degrees of polymerization of 100 .	3.4298317363046955

Now , how do you do that ?	5.8357696839635365

Now , we have seen that x n of 100 corresponds to a p of 0.99 in one is to one case , one is to isometric ratio of the functional group .	3.4422707132633987

So , you can say that if I stop the reaction and we have this reaction kinetics , how the p varies with time .	4.234626599416675

We have seen in the previous pages .	4.935794604199383

So , you can always say that if we stop the reaction , such a time which correspondence to a p of 0.99 , then you will get a molecular weight corresponding to degrees of polymerization of 100 .	3.5952189382732618

So , as simple as that .	7.338340324695794

Now , what is the problem in that if you stop reaction as a level of say , 0.99 or 90 percent conversion ?	4.010575091289492

What do we get in hand ?	6.367225813603984

So , if you are talking about a polyesterification reaction , what do you get at 99 percent conversion level ?	3.8287805876627123

You get an average of 100 and what you have both the sides and you also may have some monomer present .	4.013679876375783

So , at the level of 100 degrees of polymer , what do you have in this reaction medium ?	5.01000396753893

You have the hydroxyl acids which correspond to some size and you may also have , we will also have some unreacted monomers as well .	3.0464638659238186

So , you stop the reaction in this level .	6.0636565400906735

What you have ?	13.207977466467467

You have till the possibility of these molecules participating in the further reaction .	4.110058014441363

So , they might do react and build molecular weight or they might bide in between and degrade the molecular weight .	3.36274427528154

So , if you stop your reaction to build a molecular weight or target a molecular rate of 100 degrees of polymers correspond to 100 , if you stop the reaction at 99 percent conversion level starting from one is to one , so isometric ratio you get this , but this will pose lot of difficulties in the next step when you do processing steps like compounding or molding because this has presence of active functional group .	2.7934292947342763

So , this can react with each other or a polymer backbone and degrade the polymer or build the molecular .	4.154759317941068

So , you know at the end of your molding step , the molecular weight might be different than what you target it for .	3.866078267369107

So , your properties what you targeted will be different .	3.8785876286386065

So , it is not advisable that you do a reaction and stop in between at the level what you target it for .	3.241890771335507

What are the strategies we can achieve what we targeted one is to one of the monomers in excess ?	4.3472833256528265

For example , say you have a monomer AA and BB .	5.825765479614004

Now , take a concrete example of a polyamide formation .	4.195237767811687

If I take this as excess , now this will react with this acid functionality as along they are present because they are present in a smaller amount .	3.5606740773907632

At the end , all these carbolic liquid will be consumed and you will land up a polymer or oligomer chain with both sides amine groups .	2.8942130976665292

So , you will land up something like this .	4.652743485414625

Now , this cannot react by themselves .	5.252936128321786

So , if you stop the reaction in that level , you are ensuring that there is no left over swage group , carboxylic group in the medium , so that they cannot take the amines by itself , cannot take part in the reaction themselves .	3.479606040619241

You land up in something where both side are COH group , right ?	3.3996687184044783

If you have excess , this diamine has an excess quantity , then we will land up in a polymeric or oligomeric chain , where both sides are capped with amine group .	2.6462260342776673

If you have excess di carboxylic acids , then you will land up in the polymeric or oligomeric chain have in di carboxylic acids .	3.0878710094324733

Carboxylic acids have both the ends which will ensure that this cannot react by themselves , so that your polymers are virtually dead .	2.9627355654285368

Now , unless you have something in the reaction medium , further when you take these polymers out and do the compounding and molding step , unless you have something in your adding from outside which will be able to react with either of this left over functional group .	3.0091211542902996

Then , it will stay as it is .	5.152875146020409

It will not react with the functional group present in the polymers formed itself .	5.6077026718766

So , that is one of the strategies of making or controlling the polymer .	3.6499050741286387

As we will see what is the quantification or how much excess we have to take to target a sudden molecular weight .	4.038253028182304

We will come to that quantification level .	5.184041895716352

In next page , another strategy is to take chains topper .	3.373798397522605

Chains topper molecules are molecules having mono functional group .	4.016969006149398

So , instead of taking AA plus BB , you take just B in excess .	3.082929036199327

Then , the chain in which the ends are capped with B , the other ends are dead .	3.980511096170757

So , if you have some chain like this B with dead end here and again B with dead end here , then you are forming a chain which does not have a reactive group or either of the sides .	2.8396873069165736

That means this reaction this monomer cannot or this chain cannot take further reactions which will allow you to control the molecular rate .	3.152923434436337

Let us take example .	8.035278717895107

If I take again go back to same polyamide formation .	3.695929788943196

If I add a benzoic acid , you are going to get a molecule something like .	3.714434119908882

So , this end does not have any reactive functional group .	4.549616109352427

So , by this way , if you have all the chains are capped with a long functional entity , not reactive group , then will these molecules will not take part in further reactions .	3.3357555029931114

So , if you take this out , this polymer out and do further in a molding and compounding , go to the compounding step , then because these chains are capped with a known reactive group , they will not take part in further reaction which means the polymers are practically dead polymers .	2.8071774750876712

So , your molecular weight has no change .	6.799545961566167

So , whatever at the end of your processing steps , you will get the same polymer in the property which was related to the molecular weight , of your target molecular weight .	4.03621022368341

So , you will get that same property , but in the first case , if you stop the reaction in between at some conversional level , then what happened in after step you go through the compounding and processing step .	3.5367107835258786

In the final article , final application , the molecular rate will vary from your target molecular rate .	3.7696390566900218

That means the properties also will vary .	4.609922075291936

So , it is advisable is always done in industrially .	3.7668370926493604

Also , it is done by either by taking one of the bi functional or poly functional monomers in excess or mono functional monomer which is termed as chains topper added externally , so that we can control the chain length you know target .	3.2751282872666057

Now , what is the , how we can relate to the amount of excess or amount of this mono functional chains topper ?	3.43011912655879

How does it is related with the target degrees of polymerization .	3.779272993852767

We will come to the next class , next lecture , but in detail , but just before we go to that quantification , what was , how did we get the x n bar or any polymer mixture .	3.0160458449443306

Remember , it is the number of molecules at the beginning , and number of molecules at the end , which will give you the average degrees of polymerization .	5.406528015699679

So , what will we do ?	6.310800928988921

We will take from this , from this and continue in the next lecture , the quantification .	3.975936225580838

That means , we know that there are two strategies , we can follow taking one of the bi functional monomer in excess or we can add some amount of chains topper which are nothing but mono functional groups .	3.8276938822714786

How much excess will I take ?	5.465104618566784

What is the relation between conversion and excess in the molecular weight ?	3.8715811290383453

How much should I take , because if we take too much excess , then ultimately you will not land up in the target molecular weight , you know the molecular weights will be very , could be very low .	3.6567223889875877

So , you should know a priori what is the relation between a molecular weight and the ratio between the monomers by a function or if we add , what is the effect of molecular weight if we add some mono functional group from outside .	4.359954422546502

We will come back in the next lecture with that .	4.8065899430051795

Welcome back , now in this lecture we are going to continue our discussion , we are having in last lecture on Chain Dimensions .	3.470063255157654

And then we would move to a new topic on Frictional Properties of Polymer Molecules in dilute solution , which basically talks about mainly the viscosity of polymer solution .	2.7519687799083394

Now , in the topics we have completed our discussion shape and size of polymer chains , and then you also completed deducing an expression for understanding expression for freely rotating chain .	3.070787037078736

Now , what we are going to discuss is how the chain dimension , the chain size namely the RMS end - to - end distance ; and radius of gyration varies when we introduce the restriction on bond rotation .	2.6281774900742447

And then we also , we will understand how the long range steric interactions effect the polymer chain dimension ; and then the end we will start the discussion on frictional properties of polymer molecules in dilute solution .	3.818079787708838

Now just recap , we had whatever discussion we had in last lecture , about the chain dimension , polymer chain dimension for a linear polymer chain we discussed that most of the polymer chains are flexible in nature ; and they form random coil structure , either in solution or in merit .	3.321579595739939

And we used Gaussian distribution function to get or understand the end - to - end , RMS end - to - end distance for that , then if the chain or the backbone , polymer backbone become stiff , then polymer the coil , the random coil becomes more elongated , and it is become worm like ; and if it is if the backbone becomes more stiff , then ultimately the chain become like a rod , so these are the possible shapes a polymer chain can take .	2.849568700139078

In terms of size , we discussed a contour length , which is basically n multiplied by n is the number of bonds , and l is the length of each bonds .	3.03053527352816

And then we introduced , we said that because the random coil is always fluctuating in because we have several conformation , numerous conformation the coil shape is always changing .	2.8125338666980992

So , actually you have the end - to - end distance between in a polymer coil is always changing , so you have to get a time average end - to - end distance , we introduced the term root mean square end - to - end distance , which is given by this .	3.7461271371099842

And then you also discuss radius of gyration again time average quantity , which is the root mean square distance of the , elements of the difference parts of the polymer chain from the center of gravity of the coil .	3.1878169073844242

And you also found that there is a relation between the radius of gyration , and root mean square end - to - end distance , so if you find if you find one , the other one you can get it from this expression .	3.5518001684737937

We discussed first the freely rotating chain , how the size the end - to - end distance , RMS end - to - end distance comes about , we found that that is n to the power half multiplied by l .	2.962825016338274

And then we also discussed the effect of RMS end - to - end distance , the effect of bond angles restriction on the RMS end - to - end distance , and then today we will start discussing on these two topic or in these two restrictions .	2.923378680450285

So , this is what you found , freely rotated , freely jointed chain there is no restriction we got RMS end - to - end distance for free chain , if as a subscript it is meaning is that it is a free rotating chain , it is given by this expression and when you have bond angle restriction , we get this expression .	3.1499206267629054

Now , most cases usually polymer and carbon backbone , so it has a theta between 90 to 180 which means cos theta is negative ; so as expected this will be more than the end - to - end distance , RMS end - to - end distance restriction from bond angle will be higher than the end - to - end distance for freely rotating chain .	2.879709157402345

And same as the radius of gyration , most cases we have now tetrahedral bond angle is 109.5 degree in that case , this factor comes out 1.4 times .	3.6347969692596633

So , basically the root mean square end - to - end distance for bond angle restricted chain would be nearly about 1 4th times , 1.4 times of the freely rotating chains RMS end - to - end distance .	2.192315908229388

Now , let us talk about the restriction on bond angle bond rotation , rotation about the single bond , and which we are talking about because this is this restriction comes out because of near nearby groups .	3.2214416759201536

So , this is this is short range steric restriction , now we start our discussion with a simple molecule of n butane , and we found out how the conformation , what are the confirmations this normal butane can take , and how the potential energy changes with different conformations .	2.7849067674183283

So , what which is we know that , the word the potential energy , the chances of that being stable is higher ; so this is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , these are four carbon atom in a butane , we are not writing the hydrogen groups here .	3.0600552719747953

Now , this configuration , we can put in two types configuration sawhorse projection , and Newman projection , and then in this case , this 1 methyl group and 4 methyl group is trans to each other .	2.7653513288030793

So , we are telling this conformation as planar trans , and we can show this conformation in Newman projection like this , this dots are CH 3 when this CH 3 groups are same side in the same plane , there are seems to each other , then we have a planar cis conformation , and this is shown by Newman projection in this .	2.6521957937256935

Obviously this here , because of short range steric interaction is lower , this will be much stable , much more stable than this is conformation where the short range steric interactions are higher between the two methyl group .	2.9787052495186703

Now , in this case , we are defining the dihedral angle is 0 , dihedral angel is the angle between two planes , one plane is going through c 1 , c 2 , and c 3 ; so this plane 1 , 2 , 3 , the plane going through this three carbon 1 , 2 , 3 that is one plane , and second plane is between 2 , 3 , and 4 .	2.217211964357182

Now , in this case they basically above this line , and other one lies below this line , so we are telling this is a dihedron angle of 0 degree , and in this case obviously , dihedron angle of 180 degree .	3.074325070187637

Now , some books , some texts follow that this is 0 degree , so do not confuse , in this course telling this is 180 degree , and this is 0 degree because we will use this phi in the expression of RMS end - to - end distance as well , so this phi is equal to 0 , and this is phi is equal to 180 degree .	3.4768388377324193

So , the end - to - end distance in this case , distance between two ends , two carbon atoms present in the ends at 3.9 ampere , and in this case 2.9 ampere and as you have , you can understand and this is more stable conformation than this .	3.869311552668662

So , obviously the end - to - end distance would be more closer to this , compared to this ; and if there was no restriction , for a free rotation it would have been somewhere in the middle .	3.200180133687937

If there are no restriction on one rotation obviously , it would have been somewhere in between in middle , exactly in middle , but because this gives when you go from middle towards the planar trans conformation , you get lower energy , lower potential energy whereas , you can go towards cis conformation you get higher energy .	2.3714730008672484

So , it is always likelihood that pure end - to - end distance will be higher , compared to when there was no restriction of potential .	3.3876930059683126

You can show schematically , how this potential energy varies with different conformation , which is obtained by changing the dihedron angle , this one is the planar trans conformation which as I showed , because these two methyl groups are extremely apart , they have the least potential energy .	2.438812973663511

And you can rotate the , you are looking from front side , so this is 1 , this is 2 , this circle is 3 , and this is 4 these are the four carbon atoms , so you are looking from front side if you rotate the c 2 , c 3 single bond then you will get all this from other conformation .	3.198252546998479

If you if you rotate the c 2 , c 3 on clockwise direction , you will get this conformation , if you put in anticlockwise direction , you will get this other conformation .	3.163461198239024

For example , if you rotate this , you take this corner and rotate 60 degree , then this methyl will come here , this methyl will come here , and this bond will come here , and this bond will go there .	2.442648961580095

Now , these are this conformations are eclipse conformations , and these three are conformations , and most specifically this is trans conformation , and these are gauss conformations .	2.547838854367686

So , obviously , the polymer chain or in butane will have in this case n - butane will more likely to be somewhere here , which will have higher distance between c 1 , and c 4 ends .	3.478460833523996

Now , you can imagine , now if you now go from n butane , to n pentane and then slowly increase the number of carbon atoms to make a polymer , to how how this potential energy will look like .	3.0012469282644743

If you imagine that , it will be more more towards this region , the minima will be or the least energy would be , for larger polymer molecule , they will be more such conformations ; and the lowest energy conformations will be around here , will be around say 0 degree to 90 degree range , so you can imagine that , there is numerous possible conformations for a linear polymer .	2.7607084125234778

Now , that is very difficult to you know get the end - to - end distance , due to that rotational restrictions , short range rotational restriction , it is difficult to get theoretically , it is possible for simplest molecule which is like a polyethylene , which keeps this term .	2.8846854356958236

So , this is additional term appearing , and this o is for the subscript for end - to - end distance , for a chain RMS end - to - end distance for a polymer chain which has both one angle rotation , and also short range steric , rotational restriction due to short range steric interactions .	2.582824553076931

And those situations become much more complicated , and those are basically very difficult to get impossible to get theoretically , so what is done instead of getting expression for the contribution due to the rotational restriction , for short range steric interaction , we have introduced a new term which is called steric parameter , which take care of the , who takes care of the rotational restriction term .	2.6580513820194622

So , this was equivalent to this term for simple polyethylene molecule , for a much stiffer molecules like polystyrene , we cannot get such expression what we are introducing instead of this term , we are steric parameter .	2.60457692231314

So , you can guess obviously , you can expect that this term would be higher than this term , because this was for polyethylene molecule , and this is for more stiffer chains , so this term would be higher than this expression , and this term is usually comes around 1.5 to 3.5 .	3.2547043010050674

So , if you compare this dimension , which is basically we are calling this 0 , this whole meaning that the RMS end - to - end distance for polymer chains which is both bond angle restriction , and also rotational restriction around the single bond , due to short range steric interaction ; and this terms we are calling as unperturbed dimension , they are 1.4 times , and multiplied by this time , so it will be around 2 to 3 times .	2.553853470470741

This was expression for the freely rotating chain , this contributes about 1.4 times , and this contributes to 1.5 to say 2.5 times , so this comes around 2 to 3 times .	2.6726818701883257

So , if there is no restriction , no restriction in the chain , no restriction of bond angle and bond rotation , then whatever dimension the RMS end - to - end distance you would have got , in actually you consider the bond angle restriction , and also the bond rotation restriction that would be having the RMS end - to - end distance about 2 to 3 times , more than that .	2.7815934416553008

So , basically this term gives you the increase in the end - to - end distance , or increase in the dimension , because of the steric restriction both bond angle , and the rotational restriction , which means this is a parameter which predicts or which gives the idea about the stiffness of the chain .	3.8468649338965104

See , in this call characteristic ratio , so the higher this value you will the polymer chain you would expect would be much more stiffer , let us compare few numbers , numbers for this steric factor , and characteristic ratio for polymers at different temperature .	2.858420800042395

Now , obviously , as we discussed we would expects polyethylene to be much less stiff than a polystyrene molecule , so this these are the steric factor and the characteristic ratio , they are higher than polyethylene , PMMA has less bulky side group , so it is expected to be lowest , you know having lower lowest stiffness than polystyrene , so it has it has this numbers lower than polystyrene .	2.5644347809549486

Now , if you compare different temperature , so you take polystyrene at 25 degree centigrade , and polystyrene at 70 degree centigrade ; obviously , temperature goes up you expect that , the restriction for single bond rotation will be coming down , because you have more kinetic energy , because higher temperature , obviously , the rotational the restriction around the single bond would come down .	2.699091674635197

So , polymer actually become less stiff , and if you can you compare this numbers , numbers are also telling that polystyrene is 2.1 here , and at higher temperature and characteristic is 9.2 compared to a temperature , which is lower .	3.569048068294775

Same is the case for PMMA , if you compare PMMA , if you compare the number between 25 and 72 ; PMMA is less stiff at higher temperature , because the rotational restriction comes down as we increase the temperature .	3.2254660854854205

Now , look at this number of polycarbonate , this stiffness is even lower , now what is the use of this stiffness , now when you have a polymer coil or a polymer substance , now if you impact , if you have a substance if you impact on that matrix or on the polymer substance ; obviously , the chains are flexible , then it can absorb the energy applying , so it will not break .	3.696968810388021

And if it is very stiff obviously , it will break immediately or it will break easily , as you can example glass , because glass is very stiff it breaks as soon as you hit it , whereas if you have rubber or a soft polymer , if you hit it , it would not break , it absorbs the energy because the glass chains are much stiffer compared to a rubber chains , where the rubber consists of flexible polymer chains , so they absorb the energy .	2.6262261737815105

Because the polymer can change the conformation and as of the energy , now polycarbonate having lowest stiffness given by this number , so polycarbonate should be as you explains much much more impact resistance polymer compared to say PMMA or polystyrene , and which is a fact among PMMA , among PMMA polystyrene PC , polycarbonate has much more impact resistant property than the other two polymers .	2.4117167239622015

Now , we so far we discussed that , how we the chain dimensions which is basically you are talking about the radius of gyration , or RMS end - to - end distance , where is we introduce the bond angle restriction , and the rotational restriction due to short range interactions .	3.0520743681259628

Now , we have to compare , if you compare a polymer chain , how did we derive this Gaussian chain structure , the expression for the Gaussian chain remember , we used one of the chain end in the coordinate , x , y , z coordinate .	3.535247402451076

Now , doing that , what we what we consider that , this polymer molecules are volume less , we are why I am drawing this , they are several intersections , if I draw like this steps vectors like this , these are the steps random of if the polymer takes .	2.9788564332778367

Then there are several intersections possible , which is basically when the which is happening after several several steps , which is basically longer , it is not immediately immediately two of the segments or two of the bonds are overlapping with each other , but it can come back , because polymer chains are flexible it can come back and occupy the same space .	3.0878666543166156

So , when we deduce this expression , we did not consider that these vectors have volume , so what happened the same space in this model , we consider that same space which are the intersection points can be occupied by the two two two bonds .	2.786297090029086

But , in actual sense , if you one bonds of you have said this is one bond , now what was doing in the model we were basically putting one top of it , in the same on the paper itself and we are calculating the dimension .	2.616604198015199

But in actual term because this has a definite volume you cannot put on the same paper , these two cannot intersect on the plane of paper , there would be it has to expand , because this has volume .	2.845426157722224

Now , long range interactions are coming , because the fact that once a bond occupies a given volume in this space , no other bond can occupy the same volume , so if I have a bond here in the space , the same space cannot be , if I have this in this planes if you consider a bond , then you cannot , then like this let this plane is bond , you cannot occupy the same space with another bond .	2.6784253658460293

Because it has occupying some volume in the space , but in the model we did not consider , we considered that this space can be occupied by more than one bonds .	2.9520732116755313

So , once a bond occupies a volume in the space , no other bond can occupy the same space basically presence of a polymer chain of or polymer segment is excluding , any other polymer segments to occupy the same volume .	2.7312291048087176

So , the term is used is excluded volume , this is called excluded volume effect , once a space is occupied by a polymer segment , the same space cannot be occupied by another segment , so that is the way we calling the other chains are excluded other portions are excluded from that space we are calling that excluded polymer effect .	2.4122905776506083

So , obviously , now if the model was considering that this two can be overlapped in a line , obviously if they cannot the chain has to expand a little bit , or in other words the conformations which had list number of intersection , will have higher probability than the conformations which has more number of self interactions intersections .	2.3556778409922994

Obviously , the volume , the polymer coil will expand due to this excluded volume effect , so effectively the polymer size , or the radius of gyration and the RMS end - to - end distance will also increase .	2.756342797528821

So , in real chain the RMS end - to - end distance is actually higher than the unperturbed unperturbed dimension , when we did not consider the excluded volume effect .	2.854871998055662

If we put a factor to equate them , now this has to be more than 1 , and this is called expansion factor , so if this is 1 , then these are equal if there are more expansion , then this will be higher than 1 .	4.0640486901171435

Now , as you can think that this volume exclusion would be , volume expansion would be expansion or the volume exclusion would be higher , wherever the polymer chain density is much more , because if the polymer chain density is more than the chances of that two segments , or two bonds trying to occupy the same space is high .	2.9617361856316555

So , the expansion would be much higher in that compared to a region , where the segment of polymer chain density is lower .	4.1685501959473825

So , we cannot , that is the reason we cannot equate or put the same expression factor , in in case of radius of gyration as well , so we are putting a another expansion factor , in case of radius of gyration .	3.263568293013948

For a small expansion this can be shown theoretically that a the expansion factor for end - to - end distance higher than , expansion factor for radius of gyration .	3.2479501305050698

So , please remember that for large expansion , this expansion factor is approximately proportional to the molecular weight to the power 1 over 10 , and we know we knew that this unperturbed dimension was dependent on 10 to the power half .	3.65568945095473

So , the real chain , real end - to - end distance would be proportional to approximately proportional to this multiplied by this , which gives you 10 to the power 3 by 5 , this is approximately proportional to n to the power 315 ; the RMS end - to - end distance for a real chain .	3.105725127449019

Now , what happens when there is more than one chain , real scenario if you are talking about polymer solution or a polymer melt or a polymer mass obviously , there is no single chain they are many chains .	3.852681916867354

Now , what happened in that chain , so if there are more than one chains , there are more than one chain in real environment what will happen , now obviously , if you if you consider that this is a , this is unperturbed dimension , and because of excluded volume this is expanding to avoid all the intersections , self intersection it is expanding .	3.132462079796199

Now , what if there was another polymer here , which is the case for real case , in real case there are many polymer chains , so if you imagine this is another polymer chain ; now for self intersections or intra molecular long range steric interaction , self intersection is caused by the long range steric interactions .	2.7734531673204668

They will try to expand , now if they try to expand , what will happen they will try to overlap with this chain , if they expand obviously , they will try to occupy the space which is already occupied by this chain .	2.881246329310002

Now , then they have they do not time , because there is already one segment is present , it will not allow , it will exclude the portion from the other chain to come and occupy the same space , where this will exclude any volume from the other segments .	2.8875176731786047

So , obviously , the intramolecular long range interactions , steric interactions try to expand the chain , whereas intermolecular long range interactions are basically try to contract , the chain and to bring in to the unperturbed dimension .	2.725242507727556

So , there is two opposite effect when you have multiple number of chains , consider single chain intramolecular interactions long range interactions try to expand the chain , to avoid the self intersection , whereas to avoid the intersections between the segments of different polymer chain , intermolecular long range steric interactions try to compact the chain .	2.487558679638124

And that is nullified in a pure , so basically in a pure amorphous polymer this gets nullified , and your dimension becomes same as , the actual dimensions becomes same as the unperturbed dimensions .	2.898462352281636

So , in case of pure amorphous polymer , the expansion factor becomes 1 , because there is two opposite in effect causing one intramolecular causing the chain to expand , whereas the intermolecular is trying to cause the chain to compact .	2.800519684227973

What happened in the dilute solution , now in dilute solution you have polymer there are not many polymer , when you have dilute polymer chain , I wrote this this two , because you are talking about pure amorphous polymer there is no solvent .	3.514853538978647

Now , in case of dilute polymer solvent , there is unlikely that two polymer chains should be so close , so polymer polymer interaction would be this exclusion will be will be less in low probability .	2.6104929511527466

So , the interaction will be between polymer and solvent , dilute solution will be interaction and polymer and solvent , now if there are if there are favorable interactions between the solvents and the polymer , compared to a solvent solvent interactions .	3.496871333261931

Obviously , the chain will expand you can you can anticipate that if the interactions between polymer solvents is favorable compared to the main interaction between solvent solvent and polymer polymer .	3.197303369620711

The polymer will try to maximize the number of polymer solvent contacts , which means it will try to expand the coil dimensions , so that you get maximum number of polymer solvent interaction , instead of solvent solvent interaction .	3.695195971937817

So , if you have good solvent , where the polymer solvent interaction is favorable compared to a solvent solvent interaction then polymer chain will expand , if you have a poor solvent where solvent solvent you know , solvent polymer interaction are not favorable .	3.171463565488766

Then what will happen , again the intramolecular intramolecular intersections or intramolecular long range interactions will try to expand .	3.319049128947801

But , on expanding it has to come in contact with the solvent molecules , with the solvent molecule solvent molecules do not like , so they will try to compact the polymer chain .	4.077537048573545

So , incase of poor solvent , a single polymer chain is tried to , because of excluded volume effect tried to expand whereas , polymer solvent interaction , because they are unfavorable to compact .	2.949681223763388

And when these two becomes equal , the polymer chain dimension is become same as the unperturbed dimension , and you have equal that solvent as a theta solvent , which basically nullified these two effects .	3.1116369455160906

So , good solvent chain expansion , the expansion factor is more than 1 , if you have poor solvent chain contraction happened .	4.035538656446736

And if it is the solvent is such that , the theta solvent where the chain contraction due to unfavorable polymer solvent interaction exactly compensate , the excluded the expansion due to excluded volume effect , and you get that the expansion factor is 1 .	3.1322186407373187

So , the real dimension of polymer chain becomes same as the dimensionless unperturbed that chain ; that means it is not perturbed by any other polymer or solvent .	3.514990544928619

This now you can justify the where this term unperturbed is coming , as if it is present alone , it is not perturbed by any other external molecule , whether it is another polymer molecule or a solvent molecule .	3.518290531843544

So , theta solvent again , so theta solvent and if your amorphous polymer , the dimension of a real polymer chain is same as the dimension of unperturbed chain .	3.3618226927496635

So , in summary if the solvent quality is good obviously , miscibility is high , the delta g mixing is less , and if solvent quality is good in a dilute solution this change will separate , they will be isolate to each other .	2.4109901390038115

And chi the polymer solvent interaction is be lower than 0.5 , they are all inter limited , for theta solvent chi is 0.5 expansion factor is 1 .	3.0768570496283068

So , there is a still isolated and Gibbs free energy mixing , now comes from only the combinatorial entropy , which is basically small for polymer solvent system , but still negative combinatorial combinatorial entropy is positive .	2.82997256614647

So , it contribute negatively it favors the mixing process , so in theta conditions still the mixing is possible favorable and you get a soluble mixture of polymer and solvent .	2.917610086344881

If this solvent becomes more poor or poorer , it becomes , the polymer solvent interaction parameter becomes more than 0.5 and chains starts segregating and it is just close to , it is very close to your , so basically the contact interaction is positive , which is nullifying the entropy , favorable entropy contributions towards Gibbs free energy ; the favorable combinatorial entropy towards Gibbs free energy .	2.5291862938738294

So , the nullify is that precipitating , and in case of non solvent when polymer segregates , Gibbs free energy mixing is positive , the polymer is insoluble , and chi , the polymer solvent interaction polymer solvent is higher than 5 .	3.106691265820572

Now , what about this , in a non solvent what about this , the polymer solvent interaction parameter becomes 0.5 , but expansion factor you can now imagine or you can think cannot be less than 1 , because it is the unperturbed dimension if you are talking about a single chain .	3.743373892763839

The unperturbed dimension is because of , the bond angle restriction and the bond rotation restriction , now you cannot have a more compact chain than that , for linear chain you cannot have a situation where there is more compact .	3.256319279490076

Because this is inbuilt to polymer chain you cannot compact , then your bond angle has to be lower , and rotational restriction has to be lower , so you cannot bring down the expansion factor , so it starts precipitating , with expansion factor of close to 1 .	2.847525463560799

Now , let us move just have a deep discussion of the , just now we talked about whatever discussion we have about the dimension is mainly or mostly all about linear polymer , which is shown here this ; now you can have branches also , you can have short branches , and you can also have long branches .	3.1142983726046896

Now , long branches can have further branch from itself , so it is a long chain branching with branches , long chain branches with branches or you have a linear chain branching here or you can have a network .	3.2874976315876556

Now , network have cross links points , lose ends entangled , this is entangled especially entangled between two chains , physical entanglement , there is no chemical cross linking here , it is basically one chain here entangled in another .	2.4790636550666156

When you call long chain , long or short how it distinguish between whether the branch is long or short , if the branch , length of the branch is more than the entanglement chain length of the entangled molecular weight for entanglement chain length they , what is the entanglement chain length is the length between two entangled portions .	2.7494198444541196

So , if the length of the branch is higher than the entanglement molecular weight , then you call that as a long chain branch , how you characterize or define the sort of gives the parameter , describe the branching ; obviously , the branched for same given molecular weight , if you have same molecular weight , because the branches the size , radius of gyration will be lower as you can expect .	3.057454028442467

So , S for the branch , you know radius of gyration for the branch will be lower than the linear for same molecular weight , so this g would be lower than , so if you can calculate these two , you can get the extent of branching , the lower is the value of g , the higher is the extent of branching .	3.6495327551273506

Now , other branching parameters , you can also define is the intrinsic viscosity of branched by linear , we will have more discussion on that or the hydrodynamic radius of the branched divided by the linear ones .	3.098804838690653

So , basically if the molecular are same then because of branches are presents the chain , the polymer chain will be much more compact , so the radius , hydro dynamically radius of the radius of gyration , or the viscosity will be lower compared to linear polymer chain having the same molecular weight .	3.1342030600508837

And you can , if you get this property like this viscosity or radius of gyration of these two , then you can find out the extent of branching in polymer .	4.120555322867553

Now , let us move to the next topic , which is frictional properties of polymer solution , we will basically keep our discussion limited to our dilute solutions , now we talk about frictional properties , first thing comes in our mind is viscosity .	2.5174452739838045

Now , viscosity of a dilute polymers you can , you must have experienced viscosity of dilute polymer solution is considerably higher compared to solvent .	3.6970624209962315

Now , that is because you have large difference in size of a solvent molecule , and the polymer molecule , because the size difference you get this large increase in the viscosity of the solvent , and that increase the extent of increase by addition of a polymer molecule .	4.322635225577546

For a given concentration would be higher if the size of the polymer goes up , so if you if you add same amount polymers of different molecular weight , in the same solvent at same temperature , then the polymer which have the hard molecular weight or higher size , it will have , the solution will have higher viscosity .	4.147142181549691

For the same for the same concentration the increase in viscosity of a polymer solution , depends on the size of the suspension in the solution , the size more size higher the size , the higher is the viscosity as we discussed .	4.334630195895058

And the size in terms depends on the chain length of the molecular weight , as we have discussed earlier , chemical structure ; chain stiffness the more higher the stiffness , the dimension of the size goes up .	3.850359694794918

And the molecular environment and chemical nature , and how what is the constitution , chemical constitution of polymer and that determine , what is the solvent given that determines how good is the polymer polymer , and polymer solvent interactions .	3.271509324861114

The more the interactions between polymer and solvent , the coil expands , so you have large size , so you have large viscosity .	3.805993619328142

So , if you have more interaction between , so if you have higher size , higher chain length obviously , the size will go up , as you have seen that we discussed just now , that the chain length goes up the molecular goes up , the size will the size will be higher , so viscosity will be higher .	3.6755418253966257

If the chain stiffness goes up , the size will be up , the viscosity will be up , if there is more interaction between polymer and solvent , the size will be up and the viscosity will be up .	3.5328155865655773

Now , there are few definitions of viscosity you should know this , these are common name of different viscosity , and these IUPAC name , these are most still now common names are used by many people , actually more people uses this common name than the IUPAC names .	2.094955493757271

This is eta is the viscosity of the solution of a concentration , of a polymer concentration C at a given solvent and given temperature , whereas eta 0 is the viscosity of that solvent that particular temperature , so this eta by eta 0 or the relative viscosity is gives by the extent of increase , in the viscosity by the addition of polymer at a concentration C .	3.144053423857369

And you , these are the self expanded , this expression which you can look at , specific viscosity reduced viscosity inherent viscosity , intrinsic viscosity is talked about the ability , intrinsic ability of polymer chains to intrinsic , increase the viscosity of a solvent .	3.333171753371603

So , that is , it gives us very important parameter which will be using several times in determining the molecular weight , so intrinsic viscosity relates to the intrinsic ability of a polymer , to increase the viscosity of a particular solvent at a given temperature .	4.066653972650811

Because , it is an intrinsic ability , the intrinsic viscosity is very gives lot of useful properties , lot of useful information , and which will be utilized in determine molecular weight , and other things which will discussed in next lecture .	3.270800153431521

Now , the two types of polymer chains can be imagine , one is free draining polymer chains , where the solvent molecules , when you when polymer chains moves in a solvent in a solution , polymer chains moves in a solution ; if the polymer chains moves without the solvent molecules , which are the associated with this , and the solvent molecules move past the polymer molecules .	3.6159144590574566

Then we are talking about freely drained , freely draining polymer molecules , so solvent molecules flow past each segment of the chain , and you can think that it is dominate about rod - like molecule , if you molecule is stiff , if you rod like molecule , then obviously , when it moves the solvent molecules will not be sticking to it .	2.902255443774429

Non - draining polymer molecule is where , the solvent molecules will within the coil , coiled polymer chain moves along with it , so if I think this why it is the column , and the coil and these circles are solvent molecules when the polymer moves , it takes the solvent molecules along with it .	2.9537708864396186

So , you can imagine that this polymer coiled solvent is like a impermeable sphere , which consists of the polymer coil and the solvent molecules , which are associated with the polymer chain .	4.126712643349879

And happens that happens for large flexible polymer chains long chains and this this polymer molecule can be precipitated by one equivalent , this is equivalent hydrodynamic particle , and one has the same friction coefficient as the polymer molecule .	2.6134036535893044

So , this is the case , where most of the polymers will deal with deal mostly with flexible large polymer chains , so if that polymer moves to the solution , it takes the solvent molecules along with it .	3.1366077013587614

So , we consider most of our polymer chains is non - draining , and the polymer coil will be thought as a permeable spherical particles .	2.7664111406601544

Now , for this suspension of this rigid non non interpenetrating sphere , Einstein ’ s equation of viscosity of a suspension is given by this expression , again this is viscosity of the suspension of the solution of this is .	3.1656747638716896

If you are talking about because we are thinking the polymers as hard particles ; that are why the term suspension , we are using instead of solution , but intrusion that is the solution .	3.0937382634550366

So , eta is the viscosity of the polymer solution , eta 0 is the viscosity of medium , and this phi 2 is the volume fraction of the polymer chain , so what we can easily show that , this expression would give this expression .	3.9283770438231804

Now , what will do now , we will stop here for this class , and we will in the next lecture , we will continue our discussion from here , and deduce the expression for intrinsic viscosity of flexible polymer chains in a dilute solution .	3.723023563411395

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture we are going to begin our discussion on polymer stereochemistry and then follow by our discussion on coordination polymerization .	2.6366085274327546

Now , we will start with our discussion on constitutional or structural isomers and then going to polymerization of conjugated dienes which will give some insight about geometric isomerization of polymers .	2.9039394354211696

And then going to different types of tacticity possible in polymers , how to analyze those tacticity and how we control or we can preferentially synthesize a polymer with desired tacticity .	2.8862993493718085

And then we will talk about Ziegler - Natta polymerization and then we briefly talk about metallocene polymerization and give some example of commercial coordination polymers .	3.125717441550976

Now this we will cover in this lecture and the next lecture which is lecture number 24 .	5.1999463537601756

Now , let us start with our discussion on constitutional isomers which sometimes also called structural isomers .	3.091221404072264

Now , let us consider a polymer having repeat unit molecular formula of C 2 H 4 O and that is the formula of the polymer repeat unit .	3.708153311677334

Now what are the polymers possible with this molecular formula ?	4.5101469400657175

We can write something like this which is PEO polyethyleneoxide or we can think of a polymer like this , which is polyacetaldehyde or we can also think something like this which all of these three we have now written ; they have all same molecular formula , this is polyvinyl alcohol .	3.3982059437194336

So , basically these are the examples of constitutional or structural isomers as we know from our knowledge basic organic chemistry knowledge .	3.4495721238351718

Similarly we can write other structural or constitutional isomers like we can write polyvinyl acetate which is having structure .	3.91245571093657

Now this is the structure of polyvinyl acetate .	6.43978836333153

Now you think poly methylacrylate .	6.037365480729894

Now poly methylacrylate ; you can yourself write down the structure and then find out that this has the same molecular formula as poly methylacrylate .	3.5564730496885044

We can give other examples like poly PMMA poly methyl methacrylate and polyethylacrylatethey all examples of structural isomers .	3.074373126758125

Now we can also have other types of examples ; for example we know polyamide .	4.564808493826951

We can have polyamides from the diol plus diacid .	3.4370844337799253

Then for example we have , say , from hexanediol plan adipic acid we form poly hexamethylene adipate .	3.152463311703334

We form this polyester .	8.952012487421033

Now we can get the same polyester by ring - opening polymerization of cyclic lactones .	4.071084557771111

So , basically these two are again examples of structural isomers in case of polymer chemistry .	4.242522356553983

Now we also have seen during our discussion of chain polymerization synthesis that always it is the head - tail arrangement when polymer chain propagates .	3.5042087882667308

It is a head - tail arrangements always preferred almost exclusively over an arrangement like head - head .	2.641063203184726

Now if you can form polymers having head to tail and head to head structure , then those will also give same molecular formula , but we know that we always get head to tail polymers in case of chain polymerization .	3.0571089447019113

Now we can have let us talk about the polymerization of conjugated dienes .	4.713840595009835

This will gives us the idea about geometric isomerization .	4.761655460755915

Now let us consider the simplest of the dienes which are 1 , 3 butadiene .	3.1187453621146095

Now you can have substituted 1 , 3 butadiene as well .	4.821445816984003

Now we can write general formula like this or we can write if it is substituted we can write a R instead of H and we can write this if R is CH 3 , then it is isoprene ; if R is chloride , then it is chloroprene .	4.194275390742993

Now how when you do a chain polymerization on these types of monomers , how can you imagine what are the possible polymers these monomers are forming .	3.6838032574669404

For example , let us take example of this general structure and see how we can think of a different polymers producing getting produced from these general 1 , 3 butadiene type monomers .	3.0651871238410378

Now let us take out a basic mode by which this monomer can polymerize .	3.3911099331772654

Now if this is a 1 , 2 addition , then we will get a polymer like this .	6.48263333232982

If it is a 3 , 4 addition , we can recall the molecule ; this is one , this is two , this is three , and this is four .	4.082483433723379

So , if you have a 3 , 4 addition , then you will get a molecule like this .	5.047263790792006

Now there is another possibility of 1 , 4 addition .	5.803690091284378

In this case you get the product as this .	6.026419062085874

Now this polymer every monomer unit can stay as cis 1 , 4 polymer which gives ; you can write like this .	3.5117586826403797

Now they can have a trans arrangement as well .	5.204259355041855

This is cis 1 , 4 addition ; this is trans 1 , 4 addition .	4.440114800312779

Now in the case of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 addition , this polymer chain also can have three possible tacticities .	3.976543562757174

We will come in the discussion about tacticity in a minute , but for time being , you take my word as that these polymers which have a stereo center to acidic carbons , they can exist as three form ; isotactic , syndiotactic and atactic .	2.569625883685436

So , basically you can have three possible arrangements for these same as here .	3.5365874950892446

So , you can now imagine how many possible isomers or isomeric form you can get by polymerization of this butadiene molecule 1 , 3 butadiene molecule .	2.8869378366154836

Now what is the difference between these two ; this is cis arrangement of the repeat units whereas this is a trans arrangement of the repeat unit .	4.311615465771231

Now if you extend this polymer chain , you can write a cis structure like this .	4.397195714413465

Now every case if you look the structure you can write yourself ; for every repeat unit you have cis arrangement here .	3.8651269748682693

Here there is a cis arrangement and for this double bond also you have a cis arrangement .	5.971980314837645

Now you should look at these molecules , this is not very regular .	6.4078131196542785

As they are not very regular what happen ?	7.740179418372336

They cannot pack well in a crystal lattice and as a result this has soft polymer .	3.4070208102306174

So , it has a non - regular structure .	5.339693242806405

So , do not crystallize .	9.799083525813533

Hence it is a soft material .	10.170940694955299

The T g for this is minus 73 C and T m is 28 degree centigrade .	4.92988333543929

Now if you compare this to the trans arrangement .	4.395380804301082

So basically in this case , every monomer unit has a trans arrangement .	4.251358954608698

Now you can yourself imagine this is a very regular structure which means if you have regular structures , then the polymer chains can come closer to each other and pack very well .	4.370136386455567

As a result they can crystallize easily and hence the melting point is higher 74 degree centigrade compared to 28 degree C .	3.108013582231149

So at a room temperature , this has a crystalline structure .	3.8045564187990553

Crystalline domain exists in room temperature which actually gives this polymer the strength and this is a hard material .	4.109619228847055

So this is hard material , regular structure , crystallize easily .	3.803450540197698

So , in a polymerization what is the relative facts proportion of this all the possible structure we just discussed 1 , 3 addition , 3 , 4 addition and 1 , 4 addition ; obviously , between 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 1 , 4 addition ; between these three obviously it will be the addition which will give the intermediate having lowest energy .	3.3023273995323783

Obviously , b p dominant product among these three and most cases because the 1 , 4 addition gives a longer resonance stabilization in most cases , this is the preferred propagation mechanism compared to the other two .	3.222260805817122

Now once you have a 1 , 4 addition between cis and trans , if you just consider what is the possible structure of the monomer itself .	5.072149038905592

Now you can think two type of special arrangement ; one is transoid where these two double bonds are in trans and one is cisoid .	2.551634647962367

The confirmation of that monomer will determine the resulting polymer chain and between these two , the transoid structure is a much stable structure compared with cisoid structure .	3.3959725436957098

So , unless there is a specific organization or specific mechanism occurring in normal cases , trans 1 , 4 will be a predominant product compared to a cis 1 , 4 product .	3.285182926177188

Now there could isomerization among the intermediate states .	3.7707257900090214

Now if I write , so this is the propagating chain end .	7.152659396544425

Now this can and this will take part in resonance and it can form .	5.381683869258598

This is a chain end ; this is not the polymer , this is a chain end .	6.815847927697407

So , it could be radical , it could be cation or it could be an anion .	5.15306202758326

This is the chain end ; this monomer will come and add to this and the chain will propagate .	4.6609890105914005

Now this single bond can be easily rotatable .	6.454958980220947

It can be easily we can rotate this around this single bond and if we can rotate we can get .	4.454053656577059

Now when this in resonance , it will form this chain end .	4.323845584953052

So , basically you can have one chain end with one active center and because of resonating structures , it can actually form another geometry around the double bond and now this propagates it will form a trans polymer , if this chain polymer , this chain propagates , it will be a cis product .	2.9961643421127464

So , even if you have a cis chain end it can isomerize and give you a trans product .	4.188695191498087

Now that depends upon the temperature .	7.487688084505043

If your temperature is high , then there is this isomerization between this two monomer ; these two structures are highly possible .	3.5262424698144694

So , there is always almost equal possibility of this propagating and this propagating which mean that the resulting polymer will be a mixture of cis and trans product at a higher temperature .	3.457779115676964

If you lower the temperature ; obviously , this isomerization become less and less probable then the most stable structure which is a trans structure will polymerize which will product .	2.796474504994991

Now if you have this R depending up on size ; obviously , you can imagine if R is high , the more the size of R , the trans product will be more dominated because the energy difference between cisoid and transoid will be much higher as you increase the size of the R .	3.417928361714246

So , if you increase size of R in absence of any specific mechanism , the trans will be higher product , and if you decrease the temperature again trans will be a higher predominant product .	3.4165469215244832

Now let us look at some data .	4.766594548526757

If you take butadiene this molecule which does not have any substitution and isoprene which has a large substitution , then if we do a free radical reaction at 20 degree centigrade , you get the trans product higher .	3.3623720046152417

If you increase the size of the substitution from hydrogen to metal , the size goes up .	3.442293704248382

So , your trans product is become more dominating than or in comparison to the case where there was no substitution .	3.2753094219750274

Now this gives you the temperature ; compare between these two isoprene free radical polymerization at 20 degree centigrade and isoprene free radical polymerization at 100 degree centigrade .	3.2181284320770067

Obviously as I explained a few minute back that if your temperature goes up the chances of isomerization provided the isomerization will be higher .	3.0028928081391957

So , there will be always chances of cis and trans forming together .	3.651833509508645

So obviously if you compare this two , now there is a significant increase in the cis isomer as well .	4.413627284905046

Now what happened in case of ionic polymerization of butadiene .	5.412922113376501

So , let us again take example of , say , isoprene .	4.415741516491057

If you do in a non - polar medium and with a small counter ion , now we know in or from our knowledge about anionic polymerization that there is the anionic chain and the count ; there will always be the counter ion , say , M plus .	3.381503425813536

Now they can exist in different state if the polarity of the medium is higher , then they will slowly move from methide ion covalent bonding to tight ion pair then to free ion pair .	2.7003733284983955

If the polarity of the medium is slower , then they will become closer and closer .	4.224753047034796

If you have non - polar medium they will become very tight ion pair .	4.3492243115275775

Now if have tight ion pair , then the smaller the size of this counter ion , the tighter would be your interaction between the anionic part and the cationic part .	3.2016313894502653

So , in this case non - polar medium and lithium counter ion , they will be remaining as tight ion pair .	3.621744199435686

Now if you use this condition and make a polymerization of , say , conjugated diene this counter ion lithium , so let us write here ; we will be very close , they are not isolated .	3.6922711179656735

So when the new monomer adds , there will be a interaction , coordination between the chain end the polymer chain end or active chain end , propagating chain end and the counter ion and the monomer like this .	3.811218890891712

So , there will be an interaction between this positive counter ion and the negative propagating chain end and the new incoming monomer .	3.1766010422441804

As a result now the cis this is coming from same side .	3.445357163977191

So , you will form product like .	5.246327925432056

So , because there is a interaction between this counter ion and the chain end and the monomer , they will form a predominantly cis product Now , if you increase the polarity of the medium then obviously , then the counter ion and the lithium will be well - separated .	3.8448345450904777

So , if the medium is non - polar and your counter ion size is lower , then there will be a possibility or there will be an intermediate formation by coordination between the anionic chain end and the incoming monomer .	3.208866779588835

And that will lead to cis monomer formation whereas if you increase the polarity of medium , then obviously the active chain end and the counter will be well separated , well solvated ; so there will be apart from each other , separated from each other .	2.8824565214705684

So , there will not be any possibility of this type of intermediate formation .	5.118902698520002

So , as usual the trans product will be dominated .	4.300682622269272

So , if you look few data ’ s you take butadiene and isoprene ; obviously , we will compare anionic at anionic polymerization 20 degree centigrade in non - polar medium hexane , anionic polymers at almost similar temperature at non - polar medium .	2.420279263183327

Obviously because there will be a dominated cis product .	5.943320080015552

If you instead take a cycloid hexane , you take diethyl ether , increase the polarity of the medium keeping any other thing , then look at this ; cis product is not that dominating now .	2.59400153584366

If you increase the polarity further then cis product will become lower and lower increasing the polarity of the medium .	2.823678152416394

Now I think with this we have completed discussion on conjugated monomer polymerization of conjugated monomers .	3.2525796814975068

Now let us talk about the tacticity .	5.15803317334888

If you take a simple monosubstituted monomer and then consider what happens when this polymerize ; now we can consider a polymer where you can have two types of stereo chemistry , you can have this .	4.090590456999726

So , these two carbon atom where you have four different substitutions .	4.606430998609364

So , as you know from our knowledge if carbon has four different substitution then this is a stereo center or stereogenic center ; sometimes we also call this is an asymmertric center and it is a chiral also .	3.3714569106067187

It is in chiral , the chiral center as well .	3.3095307359257173

Now you can write you can name whether it is r and s .	4.918768051637102

Now that will depend up on which get priority whether this one or this one .	3.156278388048915

Now that will depend up on which is having higher length , whether there is a functional group or not .	4.576426286235403

So , we do not know ; from this structure we know whether this r and s but at least we know , if this r then this is will be s or if it s this will be r .	3.1972067045204686

So , to avoid confusion sometimes it is written at small r lower case r and sometimes this is written as s .	2.8273534295224643

And some cases or some people also prefer to write this is d l or we know this is d or l but if it is d then this is l ; if it is l then it is d .	3.556018115952084

So , these are the other type of nomenclature we use .	4.895329529627646

Now this cannot be this two configurations cannot be interchanged by simple rotation of around the single bond .	2.5105300645668414

Now will that be optically active .	4.810094538368532

By definition this should be a chiral molecule .	5.866839407053515

So , this will be optically active .	6.383373549336289

Now if you claim that the optically activity is a very short range phenomena and that only depends upon first may be first one or two atoms or groups around this stereo center or asymmetric center .	2.345651723171934

Now in this case in a polymer , there are hardly any differences between , say , first two group or atom in this two case .	2.98617736989331

So , basically though in true sense it is a stereo center and a chiral molecule but because these are long molecules and first few molecules are same , they basically do not show any optical activity .	2.6628936386456616

So , they are basically achiral in nature .	4.810573238754927

So , they do not show any optical activity .	4.486209869807743

Now you can argue that the carbon which is almost at the end and on near to the end group and obviously in the end , there will be some functional group and the other side will be the rest of the polymer chain .	4.283991041682749

So , that symmetric carbon should have some optical activity .	3.4278525114756655

You are right saying that the acidic carbon atoms at the end which has one of the functional group associated instead of a polymer chain , this should be chiral and show some activity but their concentration in the polymer is so low that in practically they do not contribute any optical activity or you do not see .	3.5214706265126816

Their contribution is so low that you do not see any optical activity when you get to measure the optical activity of the stereo polymers .	3.3237849954087446

Now polymer also show optical activity if they are a optically active conformation .	3.8342873079993987

In a macro sense , if your polymer has a , say , helical structure or something like this biomacro molecules , then their conformational structure cannot have any symmetry element which will result in the optimal activity .	2.41455487314656

Now , that happens in case of biomacro molecules where you have exclusively one such conformation present in the sample .	4.441969193815689

But in case of synthetic polymers , now these conformations , there are many conformations polymer conformations possible for single polymers and in a polymer sample the average doubt and you do not see any effective optical activity for that optically active conformation .	2.7566083328553446

So , if you add the next monomer what would be the arrangement now .	4.221226611341878

Now , it can have two types of arrangement where I can have .	4.827073631099324

So , basically in this case this two molecules this two carbon atom has different configuration .	3.7686992770962573

If this is r then it will be s whereas in this case they have same configuration ; if this is r then there also r .	4.50858248059982

So , that is too possible if you can add ; if you think of adding another one , you can have another two possibilities and so .	3.7698774243333157

Now if all these configuration of these tertiary carbon atoms are same , then we call this is an isotactic polymerization if this is all same .	3.3857200970786208

So , if I can write this is ddddd or say rrrr , whatever way you write , then this will be the dl dl dl or rs rs rs type of configuration .	2.758134920258439

This alternate configuration of the carbons symmetric centers and in this case it will be arbitrarily atactic would bem say , ddl dlld something like that whatever you want .	3.098826064063519

This is arbitrarily ; there is no order as such .	5.498658630950175

Now why you are interested in knowing the syndiotic tacticity of the chain polymers ?	4.190614072036177

Obviously as you can expect from the structures , these two both isotactic and syndiotactic will have regular structures .	3.1557491189785467

They have regular structures ; obviously , isotactic will be having more regular than symbiotic structure .	3.0236873728197717

So , if I consider a molecule like , say , propylene and make polypropylene out of this ; may be you can make a isotactic polymerization , you can make a isotactic polymer of from propylene molecule .	3.3869400421037454

Then isotactic polypropylene having a regular structure will slice easily and that will be hard molecule .	3.47812286941354

And if you have atactic polypropylene , then again there will not be any regularity in the chain .	3.8745291342663872

So , the chains will not be able to slice easily and you will have a soft polypropylene which is of no use in practical sense .	3.874237183834296

So , if you want to have a application practical application of utility of polypropylene molecules , then you should have a regular structures like isotactic or some cases in that atactic also able to crystallize but probably in a lesser extent compared to a isotactic polypropylene .	2.5788293407301253

Now we can have similar sort of tacticity in case of in case of polymers where we do not have all carbon backbone .	4.420431045078866

For example , if I do a ring - opening polymerization of ethylene oxide which we discussed in the last lecture .	3.1929770005474074

Now you can imagine placing , let us take consider propylene oxide as shown .	3.6543321325341442

So , here again you can have if you have same configuration of this carbons then this is like this .	4.969371639807359

This is a same configuration ; if you have same configuration from all the molecules you will again have isotactic , if you have alternate configurations then you have syndiotactic and if their configurations are not any regular , they are not arbitrarily placed , then you can again call this is as atactic polymers .	3.22000007707479

Now in this case unlike polypropylene or other the carbon - carbon chain polymers , if you consider these carbon which is asymmetric in nature , then in this case , this two polymer residues ; in this case , this one and this one , they are actually different in nature .	3.240274934081261

Unlike the polymers the chain polymers we have only carbon - carbon backbone , in this case they are different ; like in this case you have oxygen next molecule atom and this is CH 2 molecule .	4.299077679701328

So , in this case you expect that this will show optical activity unlike , say , molecule like polypropylene and indeed they do show optical activity .	2.6793331847828377

These types of polymers actually show optical activity .	4.430480113289098

Now how do you synthesize ; what are the ways you can synthesize , what are the strategies you can take to synthesize one particular stereo regular polymer like isotactic polymers or syndiotactic polymers ?	3.124701938010241

As you know by this time that it is always recommended or beneficial to make or synthesize polymer having a definite stereo regularity whether it is isotactic or syndiotactic , they always have more helpful or more polymers which will have more utility compared to atactic polymers .	2.690996147978163

Now which one of these three possible stereo arrangements which will be dominated that again determined by the medium where you are doing and of course , the initiation mechanism as a cationic mechanism or radical mechanism you have taken .	3.2269057117568734

For example if I consider c s , that is the terminal carbon atom which is an active center .	4.294520191099637

Let us consider this is a propagating chain whether this is an active center ; now it could be radical , it could be anionic , or it could be cationic .	4.558998093488374

If you have an anionic then you have a cationic counter ion .	5.193952843915998

Now what are the geometries of these carbon atoms , what is the hybridization ?	4.288973382668631

If this is a radical , then obviously this is s p 2 .	5.848071527912875

If it is carbocation , then also it is s p 2 .	3.9225109328698538

Now if it is carbon anion , then ideally it should be s p 3 but because you have a substituted group substitution here R , now we know this the monomers which undergo anionic polymerization , they actually get stabilized by resonance with this substitution .	3.3251626295417767

If you remember , say , acrylonitrile or methyl methacrylate where this anion charge get delocalized by resonance with the substitute group and this requirement of resonance with the substituted group again makes this as planar .	2.267612576713704

So , this is actually this carbon is having a planar structure irrespective of s p 2 whether it is radical , carbocation or carbon ion .	2.9675903293937176

Now that will change if your counter ions are very tightly bound with the carbon atoms .	3.7087260071759487

If you have a anionic group and a carbon ion and if your counter is tightly bound , say , if you have lithium plus , you are doing a reaction with a n butyl lithium in a non - polar medium , then this carbon ion c minus will be having very strong tight ion pairs as we discussed in case of that conjugated diene polymerization ; they will be very tight .	3.2884021417157183

Now in this case , this will not be a planar .	5.496672224431312

This carbon will not have a planar geometry .	5.988151574145921

So , first let us discuss where either you have a radical or you have a cation , carbocation or a carbon anion where the counter ions are free ; they are not tightly bound .	3.881748784133027

And if they are free that happens in a polar medium , then as we discussed now , you can consider this carbon the terminal carbon as a planar molecule ; it has a planar geometry .	3.357383083967269

Now if it has a planar geometry , when the next monomer comes in because it is a planar it can come from both the sides .	3.6078004423963748

So , there is no special and so it can come from this or it come from this side as well .	3.8067981146474152

So , no special preference of or hindrance from one of the other side ’ s ; let us wipe it off to avoid confusion , this one .	3.024305724111197

So in general case , if you are talking about radical polymerization of or ionic polymerization where you have the counter ions are free , then the stereo chemistry of this carbon atom will be determined once the next monomer gets in .	3.4590331158611796

So , what happened ?	8.930903357340439

This is the monomer which I have written here at the end now .	6.029697145810433

So , what happened for this , the configuration of this carbon ?	4.713383377045633

Which side now the hydrogen and R will come ?	4.012154239992739

Obviously , they will prefer because R is up .	4.373630163041078

So , now , R will prefer to be at down and hydrogen will prefer avoid the steric hindrance .	2.8754924297033666

Now again this bond this bond they can fully rotate .	3.3157572447089203

So obviously , if the temperature is higher , then it can rotate and form the isotactic polymer as well isotactic linkage and in that case if there is a random orientation of two asymmetric carbon atom , then you are going to get a syndiotactic molecule .	3.6215126316365054

So , if you decrease the temperature you are going to increase the concentration , the tendency of syndiotactic formation and if you increase the temperature then their preference would be lost .	3.751595520634594

So , we can write this two approaches when to rate constant when k r and k m where k r is the rate constant for the syndiotactic addition , r means racemic to consecutive carbon they will have different configuration .	2.6355981797248482

So , we are writing k r and k m for the measure which will give the isotactic addition ; this is syndiotactic addition .	3.2625952824785966

Now their ratio will determine which product gets dominated and that will get determined by the difference in the activation gives few energy between the two molecule where we can write like this , where this del del l star and del del H star is the difference in the activation energy different activation entropy and this is the difference in the activation energy between the two routes .	3.15562972375217

One is syndiotactic and atactic formation and from experiment data we get this around minus 4 to minus 8 kilo Joule per mole and this we get around 0 to 4 Joule per mole .	2.5118852506752045

So , this is very low .	7.892592255404067

So , the preference one after one over 1 would be determined by the reference in their activation energies and if they increase their temperature , there will be no preference between this two .	2.916854657414166

And hence there will be tendency for any of the two stereo regularity formations which will lead to atactic molecule atactic polymer .	3.840282846749121

If you reduce the temperature of previously , there will be increased tendency of syndiotactic polymer formation .	4.0043985067436525

So if you increase the temperature , then we will get more of a syndiotactic polymers and again this we are talking about where you have either we are talking about radical polymerization or anionic or cationic polymerization where we are carrying out the polymerization in a polar medium where you have the counter ion and the active centers they are free as they are existing as a free ion .	3.6545914680771934

So , how to get isotactic polymers ; we will discuss that in the next lecture .	4.719231913272902

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and to this lecture we will continue our discussion we are having on amorphous and crystalline state , and we will have discussion on glass transition temperature , and melting point of polymers .	2.723585453307146

Now , if you look at this slide , this is the topic these are the topics we thought of covering in this amorphous and crystalline state .	3.400052638414563

We have covered in last lecture our introductory discussion on amorphous and crystalline polymers , and then we discussed what is glass transition temperature , and melting temperature for polymers .	3.183037038733023

We discussed that glass transition temperature is a secondary transition , glass transition is a secondary transition , and melting is a first order transitions for polymers .	3.5143862031073905

We also discussed in detail about the relationship between chemical structure , and glass transition temperature .	3.399753900654532

And in today ’ s lecture we are going to discuss the relationship between the chemical structure of a polymer , and the melting point .	4.070429917067365

We will discuss today about , how the measurement techniques used for T g and T m , will not have detail discussion but the basic discussion , basic technique on determining T g and T m .	2.518851713636965

And we will also discuss little bit about other thermal responses in other , other responses polymer shows when you heat up a polymer material .	2.6825997910807504

Just a recap , the factors which will that influence glass transition temperature , mainly we can divide in two factors ; one is free volume , free volume is the volume in polymer material , which is not covered by the polymer molecules , and as we have seen that , if we increase the free volume content in a polymeric material or sample , the polymers has more space to move around , so mobility goes up .	3.075808044986746

And hence the effect of , it affects the glass transition temperature , and will also effects the melting point .	3.820222843806656

Second major of the main contribution in deter or determining factor in T g is the , freedom of the polymer chain to rotate around its single bond , which gives us the mobility of the polymer chain .	3.2719288195830103

So , if you increase the mobility , obviously polymer chain becomes more flexible , and T g goes down .	3.2925989367978516

So if you go back , and look at these factors we discussed in last lecture .	3.82844363266801

If you have a digit backbone , digit group in the backbone , then T g goes up , as a result of increase stiffness .	3.8598802868641866

Flexible backbone , obviously T g goes down , if you have the steric hindrance , because of presence of bulky side groups or side bulky pendant groups , then the rotation around single bond becomes difficult , as a result stiffness goes up and T g goes up .	3.0492976066873116

If you have long plastizing side group , then obviously free volume goes up , and T g goes down .	3.071218714351043

Similar symmetrical substituent we have seen , that T g brings down polar functionalities will increase the intermolecular or interpolymer attractions , which will increase the T g .	3.051015089344898

Plasticizer increase the free volume , T g goes down , and cross - linking also decreases the amount of free volume , so T g goes up .	3.7237631644412104

Now this are some of the factors , we try to include , and will see that most of this factors also influence the value of T m , because T m and T g are very closely related phenomenon , so this factors also will contribute , may be , may not be in same extent or same nature same way , but they also contribute , in determining value of the glass transition temperature .	2.934162793320065

What about the T g of co polymer , we talked about mainly last class T g of homopolymers , now what about in the T g co polymers and polymer blends , if we talk about co polymers first .	3.527905882852057

Now co polymers , you can have random co polymers .	6.442706859665028

Now if you have random co polymers , obviously they form a single phase , because they individual monomers does not make a .	3.085583171286323

They are not distinct to each other , in the sense that their statistical co polymer , so you have a single phase for that .	3.883491899444723

And if you have a single phase , this gives as a single T g for the co polymer .If you have a block co polymer , now if the block is , the blocks involved here are invisible with each other , then we have multiple phases .	3.097233267859212

For example , if we are talking about two blocks , then , if they are not miscible to each other or other way invisible to each other , then you have two phases .	4.124639441416594

Then we have multiple T gs , each T g represents the T g for the corresponding homopolymer .	3.210353221499029

So , if you have two blocks , which are not visible , then we are going to get two T gs for the corresponding homopolymer .	3.2574107787157125

Now if , please remember that , if the sign this T g , the T g of the homopolymer in a block co polymer , will depend upon the size or the molecular weight of co polymers , as you we know that the T g also depends on the molecular weight , of the polymers , so if we talk about the small block , then we are going to get slightly less T g , then a large homopolymer , so that part you have to keep it in mind .	3.489628631035225

That if you take a small block , then T g will be lower compared to the homopolymer , which have a higher molecular weight .	4.329450766585457

If these blends are miscible sorry this co polymers the two blocks are miscible , then obviously you are going to get single phase , and which will give as a single T g .	2.867385727342581

Similarly , if you take two homopolymers , and blend them , if we have invisible , again similar thing , then you have invisible multiple phases , multiple T gs .	3.149802394446691

If we are talking about , say two homopolymer blend , so multiple T g , if they are visible , obviously single phase , and you have single T g .	3.1923663702064076

For invisible blend , it does not matter that , you know that T g is for the homopolymers , obviously then you can know you will know the T gs for the block co polymer immiscible block co polymer , or invisible blends .	3.666235945240661

What is the T g for invisible blend , if you mix ; say component one and component two , and then mix with each other or you make a block co polymer of one and two , which becomes invisible , then what is the T g .	3.265709113905488

T g 1 is the T g for the component one , W 1 is the weight fraction .	4.825984397073919

Similarly , W 2 is the weight fraction for the component two , and T g 2 is the weight fraction for the second component .	3.9090043597949604

Now this equation gives linear or straight line variation , linear variation with composition .	2.6519716194323846

So if you composition , you get linear variation by this equation .	3.265034886215145

Now this generally what estimates the T g of the co polymers or blends slightly slightly .	3.407803432893291

So the other equations , used are given by this one by T g W 1 by T g 1 plus W 2 by T g 2 .	3.256706982106928

Again this terms are same , remember this t , this T g is are in Kelvin .	3.471938324482691

So , don ’ t confuse that , for applying this equations , you must take the temperature in Kelvin .	2.6312248517150647

Now this case ; obviously this equation , predicates the curve , a curve below the straight line , with composition .	2.848607970706873

So , if you have a straight line here , it will little curve below that , and is typically under estimates , is basically to be little , under estimates little bit about the T gs for the miscible blends , or the co polymer .	2.7287719386654388

Hence the actual T g lies between a T g which is somewhere between , predicted by this two expression .	2.8967937440364806

So , basically if you find out , or if you measure the T gs or deputed a defensive thermal kilometric , which will just stop in a minute .	2.8117253608329937

We will find depending how T g you are getting , you estimate , or you can predict or you know , whether the blends are miscible blends , or they are partially miscible blend or there completely miscible blend .	2.9076011507993367

Similarly , you can find this is whether blocks , that the two block in a block polymer , and miscible or partially miscible , or completely immiscible .	2.8035713779931295

We will come to T m and melting point , before coming to melting point discussion , let us just recap with the crystallizing polymer , which we discussed in length last lecture .	2.7663470764483518

Crystalinity polymer as you know as we discussed many times in this course ; that polymer are hardly crystallize up to hundred percent , so most cases if they , the crystality varies from zero hundred polymers , so polymer are generally semi crystalline in nature .	2.57903356631257

And you have non equilibrium micro structure , co existing the amorphous and the crystalline region .	2.88063193380253

We talk about non equilibrium , because when we introduce crystalinity in the polymers , the amount and the nature of the crystalinity depends upon how you are inducing the crystalinity , whether it fast or it slow .	2.704374893435763

So the micro structure you get consisting amorphous crystalline region , are basically non equilibrium structure .	2.8510464620879206

And that micro structure actually determined eventually , the properties of material .	3.7663641537628503

We also discussed requirement for crystallization ; basically the polymer chain has to have a regular molecular structure , so that the chains can pack close to each other easily , and obviously if the inter molecular force between the polymer chains higher , then they can pack easily , or if they remain pack easily , which are they .	3.139414335673186

So these are the two criteria ’ s must be fulfilled , so to get a crystalline polymers .	3.263829790222657

How do you induce crystalinity in a polymer material .	4.519513563842082

Remember we discussed last class that , generally we can introduced a by cooling a molten polymer , or annealing a semi crystalline or amorphous polymer is specific temperature , and then is just keeping a amorphous semi crystalline polymer at a particular temperature for a long time .	2.493186314962788

You can introduce crystallinity by evaporating a polymer solutions slowly , and the another way we can introduce crystallite by drawing , which basically means stretching the polymer strain , so polymer chains at a particular temperature about T g , by which they can align , and then crystallize with each other .	2.3353621805130396

So what are factors that influence the value of melting point or melting temperature .	3.7510154075674644

Let us think about the thermo dynamics little bit , we know that .	4.522390622772431

So if we consider delta G of melting , delta G of a processes , we can write T d S m .	3.2586472710050804

Now these are the delta G m , delta G , delta G m and delta S are the corresponding terms for particular , per unit for per .	2.8878484731404863

Now at equilibrium , which is a case of melting , so at melting , delta G m would be zero , T is T m melting point .	3.2652007619770065

Hence T m is given by delta H m , delta S m .	5.717686728121577

Delta H m is melting is always endothermic processes , so this is a positive value .	4.445456511398736

Similarly , entropic change in melting processes , result in increasing in , mobility of the polymer chains , so at the entropic goes up .	3.04276132582846

So if you , from this expression if you can increase the value of T m , either by increasing the value of del H , and by decreasing del S value .	4.395027611956892

If del H can be increased , by improving the inter molecular attraction , if you increase the inter molecular attraction between the polymer chains , then obviously the delta h of melting goes up .	3.2939501592358558

We will discuss the specific example in a minute now .	4.884160303595989

So , this is what I discussed that delta G m is delta H m minus T deltas delta m enthaply and entropy of fusion , for melting per repeat unit , at equilibrium delta Gm zero , so this is zero .	2.3747280383183083

So to increase T m with this chain stiffness mobility , if we increase chain stiffness , we increase the chain stiffness , if we increase the chains stiffness what happened .	3.019520097051334

When we melt these polymers , if they are stiff , if the polymer is stiff , then the increased entropies is not much .	3.442505045399383

Obviously , if you have more flexible chain , then from to bring the chains from closeting to molten state , where the polymers have much more mobility .	3.1728003772836426

If the polymers are intrinsically more flexible ; obviously for flexible polymer on melting delta is goes up more , than a polymer chains which are much stiffer .	3.1174729027457304

So to increase T m , you prefer to have a stiffer chain , because if you have stiffer chain , then the entropies increase and melting is less , so T m goes up .	3.0002103916828244

Similarly , you can increase the inter more attraction , you can introduce some specific bonding ; like hydrogen bonding , that will increase the enthalpy , the delta h of melting , and by that we can increase the melting point , and obviously better packing is always help in increasing the , you can understand better packing is always improve the T m melting point of the polymer .	2.7994283686212014

So , what are the… If you look chain micro structure , or chain chemical structure , what are the factors , you can think of , which will affect the value of T m .	3.782594966366788

Obviously , we discussed back bone stiffness , now I will give few examples , so that we can verify this concept .	3.468601572048843

So let us talk about first this example ; polythene have T m around 137 to 146 degree centigrade .	2.7973617299158846

If you introduced a flexible group in the back bone , then flexibility goes up , so delta S goes up , so your T m goes down so it comes around 122 .	2.985530579276402

If you just have a ether linkage , then flexibility goes up even higher , you get it drop in T m value .	2.8323909362901447

If you introduced a phenyl width in the back bone , your stiffness will go up , and you get a much higher T m value , increased T m value as a result of increase in the back bone polymer chain stiffness .	3.2489438345922306

We can give more example of back bone stiffness .	4.57123455786522

Normal alkane , which gives us very flexible chain , and T g T m is 50 degree centigrade , if you increase much stiffer molecule group .	3.709427011786427

So we are giving example of this back bone stiffness , which will affect the value of T m , so if you have a much stiffer back bone , by introducing rigid phenyle group , the T m goes up to 70 degree centigrade .	3.205054564236159

If you have more stiffer group , then the T g T m sorry T m goes up even higher .	3.7552781500496084

If you introduce a flexible group in between , then T m goes down .	3.058869148605853

Whereas , instead of c h 2 c h 2 , if you have alpine group , which makes the chain even stiffer , then your T m goes up drastically .	3.048160824198597

So , the example we have seen in this page , and in this page , confirms the understanding that if we increase the back bone stiffness , the T m goes up .	4.2171384250619335

Now let us talk about the second factor polarity , let us have some example about poly - amides .	2.970228574062734

So , if you have more flexible group , instead of C H 2 C H 2 , for examine three groups , three C H 2 groups , then the polymer becomes the contributions from this C O N H 2 group in this case , is higher compare to this case , because your adding more non polar groups .	2.7057703068420804

Hence the inter molecular attraction goes down , hence T m goes down , so 260 degree .	3.5031814381118473

If you increase further , then T m goes down further .	4.312595131174912

Now in this case , you can argue that , this drop in T m could be , because of the increasing flexibility of the back bone , but you write it can cause some decrease in the T m , because of increase flexibility , but the amount of drop shown here , that can be only explain by the decrease in the inter molecular attraction , because of the fraction of the c u n h group , is less in this polymer chain , compare to the one shown here .	2.9256646363137637

Similarly , you can compare nylon 6 6 265 and nylon 6 10 is 222 .	4.354249222592475

Here also , because you have , for given molecular weight you have less number of C O N H group , the T m goes down .	3.1828765139486705

The third factor we can think of is , back bone symmetry , and pendent group regularity .	2.9089248205364275

If you consider this example , when x is 8 ; that means polyethylene T m is 137 to 146 degree .	3.4001626038904873

Hence the T g goes up , but if you increase the length of the side chain , as you have seen in case of T g as well ; that the chain rotation is mainly determine by first one or two pendent groups .	3.8258874604344677

If you have a longer pendent groups , it actually plasticizes the polymer molecules , by increasing the free volume .	4.095271184074491

So if you increase this pendent group , what happened , it increase the free volume ; hence the flexibility goes up , and as a result your T m goes down .	2.9902407314359727

So if you increase further , your T m further goes down .	3.548853591597956

However if you have same thing you have seen for T g , in case of T g , if you have bulky side group , not a long not long pending grouping from the chains , but if you have a bulky groups , then this contributes or gives steric hindrance in rotation , and which increases stiffness .	3.3088528284330305

Where in this case , its free volume increases , and flexibility of the polymer chain increases , because of the increase in free volume .	4.723463796666063

So in case , the stiffness goes up , and as a result the T m goes up , and if you have , even bulkier group , then the T m goes up further .	4.38917987285725

So it is basically the pendent group which .	5.514770988701678

So depending on what is the type and size of the pendent group , the melting point gets influenced .	4.271159276041727

If you compare , give one example here .	4.466033716258828

Not this one .	13.612723180073484

So let us go back and look at this slide , we have discussed the back bone stiffness , we have discussed the polarity , we have discussed effect of pendent group size and type .	3.0409066832488687

Obviously if you have branches present in the polymer chain , it hinders in crystallization , so crystallization become difficult , so it affects the T m .	3.766508586811851

And if you have pendent polar troops , then it effects , or if a pendent polar group obviously , the inter molecular attraction goes up , and as a result T m will go up .	2.7943108139677384

If you have pendent groups present on the substituent present regularly , then it is easy to pack or packing it becomes better , so T m goes up .	2.6881613273665868

If the pendent groups are not placed symmetrically , then the T m goes down .	3.261877233289599

So , as a general factor we can say that , only linear polymers can form crystals , if the branches present in the polymer chain , it does not form crystals , or it does not crystallizes .	3.506484953756452

Stereoregularity in a polymer molecule , is critical , so if syntactic or iso - tactic polymer will have bitter crystalline , crystal ability , then ataractic polymers co - polymers are .	2.5703448413900576

We talking about random co polymers , where their due to the molecular irregularity , they rarely form crystal .	3.184003631128195

Obviously , if you have cool the polymer melt slowly then , the crystal , the polymers gets , polymers chains gets more time , and they can crystallize , and the crystallize crystallization take place easily , or the crystallize can grow in bigger size .	2.475072883451952

Molecular also influence the value of T m , this , because as you have seen in case of T g as well , that if we the chain ends are having much more free volume , so the end of polymer chains are much more flexible .	4.477918685412695

So if you have a sorted chain , then the polymer is effectively more flexible , T g goes T m goes down , and if you have a higher chain the contribution from the ends is less , so T m goes up .	3.444639203389677

So this is one example of normal alkanes as shown , that with increasing the chain length number of carbon atoms , the T m values goes up and eventually it is become a steady value .	2.824077019457622

So if you want to compare between two polymer chains , it is preferably to compare in high molecule rate , so that the T m is almost independent of the molecular weight .	3.3748989118594337

Now , we discussed the concept of T g and T m , and we also discussed the chemical , how the T g and T m depend on the chemical structure of a polymer chain .	4.244551634449417

Now we will move and briefly discussed , how we determine , or measure T g and T m in laboratory .	2.800995791000738

We have discussed this that , there are lots of physical properties changes , during the glass transition and melting , some of the them are listed here , specific volume changes , specific heat capacity , refractive index , modulus , heat conductivity .	2.7195941901356138

There are many others which can be in list , but these are some of the examples , some of the physical properties , undergo change their value during glass transition , and melting .	3.449238228542461

So if you can follow any of this property with temperature , we can find out the glass transition temperature , and melting point .	3.6613971877496954

The most basic techniques , which are used in laboratory for determining T g and T m are , the D S C and D T A .	2.837388023221294

The D S C is different term ; differential scanning calorimetory , and differential thermal analysis .	2.8838379309457216

So D S T stands for differential scanning calorimetory , and differential D T A stands for differential thermal analysis .	2.4869779962577363

What is the principle of D S C and D T A .	3.70251675689202

In D S C you typically have a chamber , where a sample is placed .	3.4484560194233347

So that is your sample S , and you have reference , which is empty .	4.3293424842586266

There is a heater , two sample heater , E s supplies energy , they is a thermo couple , sample thermo couple T s .	2.394280438360635

Similarly , here you have a reference heater , and you have reference thermo - couple , which determines the temperature .	4.2344363977651485

Thermo - couple determines the temperatures of sample , and T r thermo - couple determine the temperature of the reference there is a gas inlet , typically with your experiments in inner atmospheric , so they is a gas inlet and a gas outlet .	2.706895462653638

So what is done in this experiment ; the sample and the reference which is just a blank .	3.537177712394784

Sample are typically taken in a aluminum container , and then the aluminum container can be covered and creamed , so that nothing goes out , from the container , and parallelly they is a blank container without sample is kept .	2.5097642308200743

This two are heated , and the temperatures are maintained same .	3.4240366803669056

The temperatures for this sample , and the reference are kept maintain same .	3.6860864063364907

If there are something happen , some exothermic and endothermic reaction going on , so if there is some exothermic in exothermic transition or reaction happened here , then to maintain the temperature , the system has to supply more energy from outside , to maintain the temperature .	2.6689721942603053

If they is a endothermic process goes on , in the sample , then you have to supply energy from outside .	4.157636657304054

If some exothermic process goes on , then heat get evolves in the samples .	3.044102680220864

So to maintain the same temperature between the sample and reference , you have take out some energy , so delta E becomes negative .	2.9866477359710637

So if you consider a process , typically what happened , there is always the delta is neighbor is zero , because there is always a difference between , difference in the heat capacity between the sample , and the reference .	2.9635763277265426

So you have to always supply more heat , or at least different amount of heat , higher heat energy , to keep the sample at the same temperature as the reference .	2.9688702274893557

So delta S is always positive , neighbor is not equal to zero , due to difference in heat capacity of sample , and the reference , to keep .	3.0024951224990883

So this , again this delta is the amount of energy , or the heat we have to supply to the sample , to keep the sample and the reference temperature same .	3.456350590341739

So delta will be proportional to the difference in the heat capacities , between the sample , heat capacities of the sample , and heat capacity of the reference .	3.6418784508417206

So if they is no change in heat capacity of the sample , then the value of the daily will remain same , which will give pass the base line .	3.5781415408243915

So if you start , daily will start somewhere and remain same , as long as the heat capacity of the sample remains same .	3.1415928197066405

Now say , the sample is undergoing glass transaction temperature , if sample goes glass transaction temperature , which is a endothermic processes , so the system has to supply more energy , so delta will higher , and then once the glass transaction is over , then it will be same , again remain constant , because the heat capacity of the robbery state is higher , typically higher than the glassy state .	2.8156185759609094

The delta is e value will be higher in the robbery state , correspondence to corresponding to , or compare to a glassy state .	3.323832510606353

And this difference will give the delta c p between the glassy state , and the rubbery state , now this if you increase further the temperature .	3.205225020705004

Now if it continuing , a term , a time will come when these polymer samples undergo melting , and you get a peak correspondence to the melting of the polymer , so you get a curve like this .	3.0909274505620328

In case of D T A ; differential thermal analysis , a similar concept is applied , where you have a chamber , which has a inbuilt heater .	3.332208101435144

This is a heater , and you have sample , and again you have a reference , you have a thermo - couple for the sample , a thermo - couple for the reference .	3.807254788636603

There is a place to put the gas inside , and there is a gas outlet is also there .	3.652353647512529

In this case what happened heat is supplied , at a particular rate in the system , and difference in the temperature , between the sample , and the reference is observed .	3.5668412502006164

So in this case , delta T is a temporary difference between the same , and the reference is plotted against the temperature .	3.088973182922544

If there is a endothermic processes , there will be delta T will be lower correspondence to the difference , because you were supplying constant amount of energy to the system .	3.415935691666927

So if you plot the same graph , like we did for D S C , we get it deep at T g glass transaction temperature , and melting t you get exo peak , so this is T g and T m .	2.6787179074692804

So in the case of D S C , the temperature between reference and the sample is kept constant , and the required energy is supplied , so delta e is the amount of energy required , to keep the temperature between the sample and the reference same , is plotted against t .	3.0625912196344545

And in case of D T A difference thermal analysis , the same amount of heat is supplied to sample and reference , at a constant rate , and the difference in the temperature between the sample and the reference , is plotted against the temperature .	2.9349775372293823

So any face change , which involves any glass transaction or melting , which is endothermic processes , will require more heat , to maintain the temperature , and ideally this should be a sharp increase here .	2.4676521454819347

But as all of us know , that the polymer sample consist of many chains of different length , so the T g corresponding to each chains are different , so that is why we get a board nature of this transition , because each higher size polymers will have slightly have T g correspondence to compare to a polymer chain having , lower size .	3.0215024431223503

Similarly , the T m is little less sharp , compare to a small molecular melting point , because the polymer chain has many molecular weight ; basically consist of chains having many molecular weights .	3.2379754854865195

Now this T g , we will talk about this D S C , how T g obtained .	3.902116301692371

Mathematically , if we draw this portion again we can , so that is end of.. ... So , different scientists use different techniques or different techniques to find out the T g .	2.9476440976392375

Some uses this inflection point , the inflection point as T g .	3.4393034147918105

Many uses or that is the most used technique , where .	6.644268467413546

There is an inflection point here , and there is a inflection point here .	5.05530369620117

The midpoint of these two , some people consider this as a T g , and some cases what happened , the point where there is a maximum change in the slope , during this inter temperature in the slope changes , keep on changing .	3.8558717359898718

So the point where the maximum change in slope happens , some people consider that as a T g .	3.5636093281668946

Now this and this is very close to the midpoint of this change over .	5.873239477487599

So generally if nothing is mentioned .	5.076446125069499

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In last lecture , we started our discussion on polymer properties , and their evaluation .	3.9769479623970754

And in last lecture we discussed mainly mechanical properties , the stressed in behavior in tensile testing .	3.443497234814754

We also discussed the other testing behavior like , impact testing , and flexural testing or bending testing .	2.668235711105179

At the last lecture what we discussed was the relationship between the mechanical properties , and chemical structure or polymer chain properties .	4.0689724323990655

Now with which basically gives lower modulus , lower strength , however the same flexible behavior can be helpful in case of impact properties .	2.97742014505429

Why , if you impact , because of its flexibility it can absorb that impact energy more effectively , and gives you a higher impact strength or it does not give a better facture on getting hammered by a impact or gamma by a load .	2.6016221206155903

So , flexible backbone gives lower modulus and strength , and chain stiffness of the backbone and the bulky side groups , increases modulus , and strength which is self - explanatory .	2.693392871682674

Increasing stiffness also gives lower impact strength , and elongation at break , because if you a stiff back bone , you cannot elongate before it breaks .	2.6450382051891483

For a same , we also have seen that the modulus on mechanical properties , of a polymer , very much dependent on the temperature of the experiment , which means finally , if we when you using the polymer in a particular application , you must remember the temperature of the application .	3.4143574222972424

And second , the strain rate , if you think about the application with the material will come up , come across some load , which will come at a higher strain rate , then the behavior will be different , if you talking out just simply dead load bearing capacity of the material .	2.7395557710123937

So , modulus and other strength , or elongation at break , which means we are talking about brittleness .	3.690711742292418

If you compare semi crystalline material , semi crystalline polymer at same temperature , and same rate .	3.6447945441931706

Obviously , we know that with increasing crystalinity , the modulus and strength goes up , whereas with a if we cross link this material with cross linking , the modulus goes up .	2.8821380750720405

Now , let us talk about great dilemma in case of polymers .	4.043733670419976

Now we know that , or you can anticipate , that the properties ; mainly mechanical properties of a polymer materials , which should increase with molecular weight .	3.6581983664702156

It does increase , and then become steady after very high molecular weight .	3.185248124063351

So , basically good properties are favored by high molecular rate of polymers .	4.227614468142538

So , this is nothing unusual , so you should expect this being .	3.282687673361421

So , that is the advantage of a polymer .	6.388397122957162

So , high volume molecular weight , it gives the mechanical properties .	4.55698791656728

Other properties do not changes in molecular that much , though it also increases with molecular weight , but it does not keeps on increasing , even if it slightly with molecular weight , the other polymer will study it at a high molecular weight .	2.907868474056957

Whereas , we have seen that , you after making the synthesizing the polymer you have to go through the processing step , to make the final part .	4.096500049971304

So , you must make some polymer , some molecular weight we should be able to pass through the processing step , so that you can get the final product .	4.169595003320696

And process ability actually becomes easier , as you can understand the , if the lower the at the molecular weight lower at the viscosity , so process ability becomes easier , if you have the low molecular weight .	3.6146949037863485

So , processing good processing is always favored by low molecular weight .	3.391467387798317

So , e is a processing will , means the high her the molecular weight , it will be difficult for process , so e is a processing will be lower , with increasing molecular weight .	3.426788619069889

Now , just to spend a minute why these are processing is so much dependent or molecular weight .	2.728292973665175

Just talk about Rheology and entanglement of polymer molecules .	3.6293573832323975

The elastic properties of linear thermo plastic polymers , are due to chain entangle .	2.9765107572521217

do we the We described in last lecture that , the elastic that the resistance to deformation , is due to the chain entanglement , because of presence , because of chain entanglement , the chains are presence other , may be intra molecularly , or other chain , the intra molecular chains segments are present in the vicinity of a particular polymer chain , which basically resist the deformation .	2.7588287887540175

So , if you have some polymer molecular weight , which is polymers which is having molecular weight , such a small number , such a small value that it does not entangle mean entangle efficiently .	3.4819265964239667

Then we do not get the desire property of a polymer material , which will be useful for the applications of the polymers we usually use .	5.562069691685087

Entanglements will occur for polymer chains above a critical molecular weight , and we call that molecular weight as entanglement molecular weight M E .	3.6750598738967253

If the polymer chains and entangled , the polymer chains and entangled , then moving fast each other , going fast each other , is become more and more difficult , very difficult because they are entangles , so the viscosity becomes much higher after the entanglement .	3.0588038460968647

So , before entanglement , the viscosity scales to the , with the power of one , with molecular weight , whereas the slope changes to about 3.4 , after the entanglement molecular weight .	2.832634438187334

So , if you increase the molecular weight further , above this entanglement molecular weight ; the viscosity goes up drastically , and the processing , these are processing become difficult and difficult more difficult .	3.016659214452561

See always you want a polymer somewhere ; above the entanglement molecular weight , and just above the molecular weight , so there it can be processed easily .	4.204443248413129

So , this is the dilemma which molecular it should make , it will make high , very high molecular weight ; your properties will be higher .	3.103452040582825

Similarly the same time you lose the processibility to the way difficult to process .	3.100020754151931

So , you have to have some compromises , you have to make molecular weight somewhere intermediate , so you get the best of both .	3.806359201756441

In case of thermosets , you do not need that compromise , because thermosets are generally starts with low molecular weight polymers , and you make the final product or you process that low molecular weight , and then subsequently you cross link that , to increase cross link or cure in other term , and increase the molecular weight , so you do not have to compromise anything .	2.970249217815251

Whereas , in thermo plastics you have to compromise between these two , you have to choose a molecular weight somewhere in between , so that your mechanical properties is just above a critical value of your requirement , and your process ability also is handable , means you can do processing .	3.1916064192589

So , high enough molecular weight to get adequate properties , and low enough molecular weight , so that it can be processed , so you have to compromise between these two .	4.153270966833087

We talk about continue our discussion on mechanical properties , and we come to a concept of viscoelasticity .	4.204928266264216

We have seen in our discussion , when we were doing this as stress strain curve , we have seen that the curve stress stain curve depends upon the temperature , as well as the strain rate .	3.561425595715423

Now if you think about the pure elastic material , if we stretch a crystalline solid what happens ?	2.701169187014345

The energy stored in the material , and if we in the chemical bonds , and then if you release that stress , it will come back to the original state .	3.571260202146586

We are talking about this is a ideal elastic behavior .	6.44674229868623

Similarly if you have a liquid , then if you apply strain stress , if I have a liquid glass of water , and then pour it , then it will basically flow it , if I remove the stress it does not come back to the original state .	3.3127424410799113

So , in case of a liquid , or a fluid if I apply as a shear stress to a fluid , energy dissipated in fluid , basically flows and energy is dissipated , energy is not stored .	2.493602850830891

So , in case of elastic material energy is stored , in case of a fluid , energy is not stored , and it dissipated in the flow , so it a ideal viscous behavior .	3.009401922370511

Now polymers are somewhere in between , they have depending upon the temperature , and time of straining it .	4.066820557537676

They vary from elastic to , completely elastic to completely viscous behavior , and most of him in the conditions they are viscoelastic , so they have properties of both ideal solid , and viscous liquid or viscous fluid .	2.29169889587915

So , polymers are both ideal elastic and viscous behavior , depending on the time and the temperature , so we call polymers are viscoelastic .	3.2611696066838123

At low temperature and high strain rate , polymer demonstrates elastic behavior , as we have seen earlier in our strain stress discussion .	3.5017963133522647

There are low temperature polymer becomes brittle , it does not elongate much .	3.9978342174093098

So , polymer behavior , elastic behavior similar in high strain rate also , at temperature and high temperature and low strain rate , polymer demonstrate viscous behavior , and an intermediate temperature , the rate of and rate of strain polymer big demonstrate viscoelastic behavior .	2.6260457810382887

Now you can seen this viscoelasticity behavior if you have a silly putty , the toy material silly putty in home , but I do not have that material with him .	2.6436323127232706

So , I have , what I have , I have the dove made of wheat flour , and I just made this dove from wheat flower , I just put some water to make it soft .	2.352975150415025

Now basically what happened , this is not a ideal viscoelastic material to demonstrate , but I can show it , so that you can understand what do I mean by viscocity .	3.1776748978419493

this is a dove made up of wheat flour , and when I stretch this slowly , what happens , it just elongates , is basically it flows , so it keep on increasing if I apply this stress , or strain in a slower rate , so its keeps on stretching .	2.5361335614527833

Now , if I apply this strain rate , high strain rate from both sides , much faster strain rate what happen , what happen , let us see what happens .	2.704067745878583

Again I am saying this is not a example of a perfect viscoelastic material , but this is what , I have in hand , at this moment to demonstrate , so I am trying with whatever available at home .	3.335654812651874

Now I have this and I do it very fast , what happened , it just breaks .	3.67500665472359

So , what happened , again I am saying is not a perfect material to show , if you apply the strain at much faster rate , it breaks , it shows elasticity , elastic behavior , like a solid , but when you apply this strain very slowly , then it flows up chains , actually move past each other , shows flows behavior and it shows viscous behavior .	2.241370975810659

So , if I consider the strain stress curve , how does it look like , for a viscous and elastic material .	2.98400896763644

First of all when we do instant testing , we… One thing we must remember that ; as we do this test , the dimension of the specimen changes .	2.97629712762716

So , actually thus the strain , and the stress , or the state actually changes , because the original dimension changes .	2.7839582283031032

So , this are the term sometime used ; engineering stress is F force by original A , and true stress is changing , is actually basically the force by the area at given time , by similarly engineering strain is given by dL by this original length .	2.193875960338503

Whereas true strain would be the L at a given time ; that is the true strain .	5.062641539819326

This true stress and this true strain is difficult to measure .	4.098375950707469

So , generally we actually consider engineering stress and engineering strain all the time .	3.2493760560109677

Let us see how the stress strains behavior of this visco elastic material .	3.547779068432213

Now let us see I apply , this is stress or load .	3.4483129265523074

I apply some time t 0 , and keep at a constant level for some time , and then release again , make it 0 at sum t t .	2.9556302917801056

Now what we will do , elastic material will do ; elastic material , all the stress by strain curve will look like .	2.607194207573768

It will change , and then go back , and then of the strain will apply , the time when you apply the stress .	3.9968486913542693

There will be a definite strength , this strain and stress are related by hooks law , will come back to that .	3.1451405814895246

Now at the time , when this stress is released it will come back to the original state , and this stress and strain is related by hooks law , they are linear and is related by elastic modulus in between , as a proportionality constant .	2.5828057153022073

Now what happen to a perfect .	6.7313770078000035

So , this is a perfect elastic material , what happened to their perfect viscous material , how the strain will change every time .	2.8917331154385675

Same stress is applied , same load is applied here , so with time , how the strain will change for a viscous material .	2.927378151909793

So , the time t 0 , it will start straining till load is present , or stress is present , it will continue deform , and the time the stress is removed , it will remained deformed permanently .	2.6584819407558866

What happened to a polymeric material ; the visco plastic material , how does it happen , how does it respond with time .	3.111167440279605

It basically , let me show here strain .	4.246215419008801

So , at the time , you apply the state , it will strain to some extent , and then keep on continually forming , till the load is present .	2.8712682198890915

And when the load is removed at t is equal to t , it will recover some part , and then stay somewhere , so it does not come back to the original so on .	2.7893445860472452

So , this is a , basically example of visco elasticity .	4.342938112925812

So , if for a polymer , with temperature you can , see all this behavior .	5.676239085433762

Let us talk about a amorphous material ; the glassy state A to B is a perfect glasstic material , so if you apply stress strain , apply a stress it will strain , as long as stress is there , strain will be there , if you remove the stress the strain will become 0 , so that is the example of perfectly glassy material or elastic material .	2.7932240559100703

So , this part glassy part will behave like a perfect elastic .	3.730170469013041

what about the leathery part , B to C .	4.652776153354428

When you apply the stress apply the load , it deform fast , and then as long as the stress is present it will continually deforming , and the movement this stress is removed , it will come back , the elastic component is recovered here , and then slowly recover some of the strain , but it will not come back to the 0 strain value , there will be a permanent deformation here , so this is example showing visco elasticity .	2.84455385252083

So , the fact that it is not coming back to the original state , it is showing some loss of energy , some viscous behavior , and part of it is actually getting recovered , which is the behavior of a elastic solid , so that is the reason , it is a example of the visco elastic behavior .	3.538041413032731

Similarly in case of rubber , a similar behavior , and in case of above very high temperature is like a polymer melt , it does not recover at all , and it continually gets deformed as long as stress is present , so you get a complete viscous behavior .	3.503489997383584

Similar thing can be shown in case of that strain rate , with higher strain rate , it will behave more elastic , and is very slow strain rate , it will be close to perfect viscous and intermediate strain rate , it will be , so visco elasticity .	3.22137044960361

Now , let us move to the other properties of polymeric materials , what we discuss , we just completed discussion of mechanical properties .	2.9936881202434695

Now we will talk the other properties , and again we will not go into very detail description of these properties , and how it is evaluated .	3.333824404460804

We will just give brief introduction , brief description of those test .	3.035829078388807

Let us first talk about thermal properties , we discussed about the glass transition , and the glass transition and melting behavior of polymer earlier .	3.3597299269718977

Thermal properties are basically the response of polymeric material , when the temperature increase or heat is supplied to the polymeric material .	3.1885914946115053

Now besides the glass transition temperature and melting point , the other behavior polymer material can show is the heat distortion temperature , or has a softening temperature , and very high temperature , above of T m , when if you keep raising the temperature k if you keep raising the temperature , the polymer might decompose and gives decomposition temperature .	2.424428614064824

So , in a general , in case of semi crystalline thermo plastic material , you have ; first you have heat distortion temperature , the softening temperature .	3.033880394394791

Then you have glass transition temperature , then you have melting point or melting temperature , and then the degradation temperature or decomposition temperature .	3.8751871669549307

For thermo sets , you do not have T g you have thermosets , you have HDT and T g , and then finally , the decomposition temperature .	3.3864414372277363

We talked about the glass transition temperature , and melting point earlier .	4.301115933714696

So , we want to discuss about other thermal behavior , with of all the polymer behavior with temperature .	4.0119742962427996

This is from a practical point of view ; this is the temperature where its starts softening , the polymer actually starts softening under some load .	3.370372471972759

So , heat deflection temperature is a temperature at which , the material flows shows significant amount of the deformation , under a constant load .	3.2042992117844964

Now this significant amount , fix amount is basically is prefixed .	3.425342225124341

So , if you compare , you want to compare between materials , you can compare with the amount of deformation , same amount to deformation between the materials .	3.307283475748726

So , basically what is the test is done , that one polymer samples is specimen is taken , and one load is applied ; a definite load , constant load , and then temperature is slowly increased , at a given rate .	2.657751791198194

And like other HDT temperature will depend upon how fast you are heating up this material , how fast you changing the temperature , and obviously , the amount of load is present .	3.2163578702729416

The higher is the load , lower will be the temperature , heat distinction temperature .	4.364595795755974

Now why it is important , let me you a example .	4.281805452465289

Now these are all amaphorous material ; polystyrene , poly polymethcalate , and polycarbon BPA polycarbonate , and Tgs are , approximate Tgs are listed here 100 145 .	2.315976024277964

So , looking at this material , if you say that , if you make some specimen or some product of the material , this materials will survive till around 100 degree centigrade , but that conclusion will be erratic , if we see this example , these are CD disc made from polycarbonate , and these are made from polyemethylene immaculate .	2.7141506503021855

Now , these were subject to a , heating conditions for 96 hours at 180 degree centigrade and 95 degree erratic immunity .	2.882220964188172

Same thing here , but much lower , the picture is after much lower duration , at 80 degree centigrade .	2.6926495002306576

Now 80 degree centigrade is actually below the Tg , well below the Tg of the PMMA sample , so you should expect , the polymer should survive .	2.6302456103963876

But when you make a part its has its own load , it has some weight , so it has own load , and when you stack it this disk , basically the lower one will also have load from top .	2.458206816211703

So , at 80 degree itself it is deforming , which means it should not be used .	4.054829842404429

A disk cannot be made up of PMMA , will not survive a temperature of 80 degree centigrade .	3.2609518224971916

So , this is what signifies , so if you want to make a disk and find the , which will be used for an application at higher temperature , you must know the HDT of that particular material .	3.7296785537584887

HDT is typically as general rule of terms about Tg minus 20 degree centigrade .	2.781469665422598

So , Tg is not sufficient for practical point of view , you must know the softening temperature .	3.8222158022010753

Now , if you increase the temperature of polymer , polymers typically degrade .	4.380733710193031

This is very important in processing point of view , because while processing the polymers , are subjected to very high temperature .	3.8943074097286723

And as we have seen that T g plus sometime 150 centigrade at T m plus 50 degree centigrade or even more , and under shear , in case of processing with applying this melds and mixed to with , so does in case of molding , which mean that is undergoes polymer might degrade , and decompose of those conditions .	2.5541577721090447

So , to find out , what is inherent thermal degradation behavior , the thermogravimetric analysis is done , which is in short called TGA .	2.9654598029576977

Now T g is basically plot of white class of temperature , is just nothing but plot of weight or mass to utilize for this , the temperature .	2.7990509701068382

Again the heating can be done at in air , or intent atmosphere , like the nitrogen gas or organ gas .	2.753150906326426

Obviously , in air the decomposition rate , and the decomposition will be a much lower temperature , compare with situation , where the heating is the temperature is increase under , nitrogen organ .	3.2944220562730844

So , it is floated against temperature .	4.491386920828275

Now with , you can get this information from this test , basically we can know , at what temperature this polymer start decomposing or degrading , and we can basically find out the temperature at which 50 percent weight loss or complete weight loss , whatever is you interest .	2.82363732481708

A sometime small molecule comes out of the polymer , though we are heating , like is HCl from polyvinyl chloride H 2 O from amic acid .	2.6918977806849957

You can also do isothermal T g where weight loss is monitor , with time and constant temperature .	2.773750827657915

And at higher temperature , polymers some time depolymerisation depolymerise , which might lead to some volatile monomers .	3.1587499723677626

So , which we can get some idea about TGA , fragmentation happen during heating or as we have seen that some time additives are used during polymer formulation , so if they are , on heating if there is some loss , thermal loss of those additives , that can be also found out .	3.136244421961103

This is typical thermo gravimetric curve of different polymers , PVC PMA LDP PTFN PI in nitrogen , and these temperatures are corresponding on said temperature , and the 50 percent temperature , the temperature for example , for PMA this is the temperature correspondence to 50 percent weight loss .	2.5701220413259

Now the amount of mass is remaining after complete bonding , is what , is char , what is the char , means formation after heating , and that is very important when you talk about the flammability , and fame resistant behavior of the polymer .	3.5476907337732473

So , in this case , basically it is showing that there is no char formation is taken place , basically entire polymer is de composed off , and as gone out .	2.8162879339761018

If in this case for PVC , there is a significant amount of materials remaining , even after complete bonding .	4.42527351044943

So , there is some char formation as happened in case of PVC .	5.31594024877583

Obviously , it also depends on how fast you are heating .	5.225201565464266

So , the effective temperature actually becomes slower , if you increase the heating rate .	3.7040413899518985

So , if you want to compare between different polymers , the thermal stability at higher temperature you must compare , at same heating rate .	2.987067091505707

Now there are other like thermal behavior , thermal test basically done , is high cut softening temperature point .	2.6156537747104553

It is the temperature at which a flatten , needle of one mille meter square cross section , under specific constant load is applied , and the temperature at which penetrates , the plastic specimen to a depth of one mille meter , it is known as high cut softening temperature .	2.3300872566133553

Another important parameter , or thermal behavior is , the maximum use , or continues use temperature , or it sometime called relative thermal index .	2.612994587498676

It is the temperature , the highest constant temperature at which the material will survive , related to a application requirement , what does it mean .	3.213555398196823

It means that , you can use how long , and what is the service temperature , if you can make like that example I showed in the C D , what is the service temperature , that like means what is the maximum temperature , it can survive for long duration , at a for the particular applications .	3.39895875844367

If you want your C D material to survive for ten years , then you must specify what is the temperature ?	3.2150278228006828

You can find out what is the maximum temperature it can be use .	6.415661585265507

So , you know like in hot countries , the temperature may go up to 45 50 degree centigrade .	2.6918152236163992

So , if you want to survive , then your material , the maximum temperature at least should be 45 degree or 50 degree .	3.0222162258233514

If we talking about a plastics , which I used in a car bonnet , then you know that on getting constant heat from outside , the bonnet temperature may go up to 80 degree 90 degree centigrade .	2.74750604277784

So , if you want to design one material , or test some material , which will survive the duration of cars life time about 20 years , or 15 years , then you should test that in advance .	2.2338925842262296

So , this done in laboratory , in a escalated way , where basically the specimens are heated , in a elevated temperature , with some relative humidity , and with time the retention of properties are monitored , and then compared with an existing material , which is already in application , for long time .	2.193247443475909

So , if you compare , with material which is existing in that particular application for long time , and if you compare your material , test material , which is as good as that particular material , or even better that particular material in the escalated lab test , then you know that you material will survive that particular temperature , at least as good as the material , which is in the market .	2.951299956560107

Let us go through the next property , which is flammability , or flame and flame resistance properties of a polymer .	3.1549732094815655

Now again this will be just briefed , we will have a brief discussion on this properties , and subsequent properties .	3.7851659791135424

Basically when you , basically put fire on a polymeric material , it basically de polymerized to monomer , and it degrades to combustible gas , and in the presence of heat it basically have form flame and it burns .	2.621641645093336

So , that is the original flammability of polymer materials .	4.468661625446252

So , if you want to decrease the flammability , you basically have to remove this combustible gas , from the system , and basically has to reduce , when the heat formation , heat generation on bonding this polymeric materials .	2.3557673839963122

How the testing is done .	6.413958136737715

It is defined as the minimum concentration oxygen , expressed as percentage by volume ; a volume percentage in short , in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen that will sufficient , enough to support flaming combustion of a material .	2.4520956530103817

Now , how many how long the flaming will happen , that has to be fixed for , comparing between materials , typically it is three minute bonding or flaming .	2.4296024049380063

So , what is the experiment is done , oxygen and nitrogen are mixed , and basically starts with pure nitrogen , and oxygen is increased slowly , to find out that the minimum oxygen required in terms of volume percentage in this mixture , to sustain this flame for a specified time said for three minutes .	2.3027525694091473

So , limiting oxygen index is basically , the volume of oxygen required , by the total volume into hundred that gives a percentage of material .	3.5534282142855598

Now the other test also there , which have done in a real applications , where basically , which is been guided by U L laboratories .	2.662798273902998

In this case they keep this specify specified geometry of sample like , and this states , this states are very difficult to carry out repeatedly , and the only trained and certified person actually do test , for this a comparing material , or give the rating .	2.152845463129124

What happened you basically take the sample , and applied the flame , from a particular distance , and some cotton are placed .	2.9469688773510216

These are cotton placed in the container below .	4.454985993539312

So , if it burns , and the while burning the sparks comes and ignite the cotton , which basically gives lower rating .	2.3726668676762115

So , a sample , which burn from less time , and which also does not ignite the inflammable material like cotton , present in the bottom of the container , they actually gives the best ranking .	2.6926101138068

It basically try to mimic the applicable a actual application , when the polymers are , actually used in a application , what you want you want the polymers in case of a emergency , what do you want .	3.5289043002975573

You do not want the polymer to burn , with a flame , and even if its burn , then it should not actually gives , or ignite the other material , other inflammable material in the .	2.772739805234807

It should not drip to the floor or some other inflammable or combustible material , so that the fire spreads .	3.327971880610946

Also important is that , it should not generate toxics smoke ; that is also important .	4.578917592231914

So , in case of fire resistance material , flame property it should not burn , if it burns , it should not drip and ignite other inflammable material , and third it should not generate toxics smokes .	2.7695520767534583

So , these are the three criteria of a very good flame resistance polymer .	3.9056834989055162

So , objective of flame integration , which to suppress , suppression of smoke , and toxic gas , it is actually is a known fact that , when something burns , it is a , if the causality or fertility of the people is mostly , because of the toxic gases , at first few minutes .	2.3397050140108773

So , if you suppress the toxic gas generation , for first few minutes , then in case of emergency , people can go out of the situation , and survive .	3.057664158593178

Whereas if the toxic generates immediately after burning , then what happened , they cannot , they actually get ill immediately , and they cannot run away and find a safer place .	2.2936609685790064

So , strategies to flame resistance is , to retard combustion process in differ phase , and char formation , causing char , if you have a polymer which forms high level of char , typically halogen containing polymers , and also inorganic polymers , and sometimes added additives , which does not , ceramic additives for example , which does not burn and just go out of the system .	2.354230145336038

They actually contribute to char conformation , and which actually suppress there , is basically prevent supply of this compostable gases , to this pyrolysis zone , and just by decreasing the met flammability .	2.0976846250713197

We just go to the next set of the properties , where is basically expo .	4.246507256711915

What happened to the polymer getting exposed environmental situation ; for example , polymers will come across different chemicals , if you talking about a medical devices , doctors or medical persons , always apply some rectifies spirit , ethanol to disinfect , so your material has to survive , so that has to be chemical resistance of the chemical , medical professions are using .	2.363474946708635

It has to be , any outdoor materials , plastics material they come , every day come across the UV light , heat , outdoor heat , rain , and the bacterias and the viruses present in the material , so that is in oxygen of the environment .	2.7108163006841304

So , basically that combine , we call that weatharability basically , when some polymer , or some plastic material is applied , we find weather ability .	2.5076044937234605

Weatherability is basically combination all this effects ; like rain , air , heat , light , so combine all this we call of .	2.3267706612496366

So , if a material or plastic which survives longer , in that outdoor condition , it is a weatharable material .	3.135837637543206

So , we test weather ability in the lab , in the accelerated chamber , which basically may make the outdoor condition , with control parameters , and we subject the experimental specimen in that condition , and after in a frequent interval , we basically test there mechanical , other properties like optical properties to find out where it is sustained in the particular , weather condition or not .	2.131040646911455

In case of chemical resistance we basically apply .	5.1350241100797085

Say we actually immerse the test sample in that particular chemical agent , for that particular temperature , and for a particular specified time .	3.3002313030912087

And after that we take out that material , and measure the mechanically property change , whether it survived or not .	2.9622764936227557

We see , we visually inspect the material , whether any swelling has happened or in surface eroded or some cracking and crazing is happened .	2.0048702382935586

And we also see whether the molecular rate of the material has changed , by the applying the coming in contact with chemical agent , which can be done by the measuring the viscosity of material .	3.5065200970844024

So , what will do we stop here for this lecture , and we will talk about other properties like , optical property , and barrier property , and surface property in next lectures .	2.984561618485003

We will also talk briefly , that most often polymer are not used as such , they are basically used with other radiatives , which basically protect some of the , this polymers , this external agent we talk about , or this enhances the property , which can be used from outside .	2.8875343203630153

So , we stop , and start with the rest of the property in the next lecture .	3.943825864459917

Welcome back this to this course on polymer chemistry , and this lecture we will continue our discussion on chain copolymerization , which we just studied in our last lecture .	2.8847349438856305

In this lecture , we will talk about the importance of copolymerization , and then copolymer composition equation , and then go into different types of copolymerization process , and resulting different microstructure of copolymer , and then talk about composition drift , and monomer reactivities , and then corresponding the effect of chain initiation reaction on monomer reactivities .	2.8043848884924705

Now in last lecture , we completed our discursion on ionic chain polymerization , and we also studied our discussion on chain copolymerization , and we talked about or we discussed different types of copolymerization ; namely we talked about statistical copolymer , alternate copolymers , and block copolymers , which could be different types of block co polymers , block , linear block trapped , and brass type of co polymers as well .	2.9907452404669512

Now just to complete the types of co copolymerization we have discussed in the last lecture .	4.012630090868412

Now , if we do not want to specify the microstructure , whether it is a statistical copolymer , as alternate copolymer , block copolymer , then we can simply write poly styrene , and write co in between acylonitrile .	3.1737467311977814

If you now that , this is a statistical copolymer , then instead of co you can write stat in between , and if you know that this statistical copolymers is a random copolymer , which we discussed in the last lecture , then we can write ran r a n in between .	3.8347394946979696

If you know that this is a alternate copolymers , between any two monomers ; a poly A and poly B , then we can write it is a a l t alternate , as a alternate copolymer , and if you know it is a block polymer , if you want to write block polymer , then we can write poly A block poly B or poly A block poly B , both way we can write in this case , but only write different types of copolymers like statistical random on alternate copolymer , you should follow these type of nomenclature , we just mention .	3.237118862576971

So , a alternate copolymer between styrene co - acylonitrile you can write , you should write poly , in brackets styrene , hyphen a l t , hyphen acyolnitrile .	2.613066251470919

Now we were discussing about the importance of copolymerization , importance of copolymerization , why we should at all be interested in copolymers .	3.1959673853402664

Now we said , that when we talk about homo polymers , now we can have only limited , number of homo polymers you know , we always using , if you have noticed same names basically coming , every time polystyrene , polyaclonoidal , polygon acetate , polymethyl like .	2.9964926062775787

There are limited names we actually used for all the times , and commercially also if you want to , or the homo polymers which are used in large scale , they are very limited .	3.5764782494486513

So , basically that limits our options to choose polymer for the particular applications .	2.88009798189325

Also if sometimes happens , in the most cases it happens ; that one single homopolymers do not posses , the required or the desired property we are looking for .	2.9953468423650618

In that case to bring , to introduce that required property , we must mix this homo polymers with another homopolymer to get the properties , good properties of both the polymers , or we need to synthesis a new copolymer .	2.763068085893112

Now in terms of copolymers , that main advantage is that , the options are unlimited .	4.469002823512257

You can choose any of these monomers , which were utilized to make homopolymers , and then mix them , and also you can mix them in , or make copolymers in different proportion .	3.0026638958796696

You can take styrene and M M A , and get numerous amount of copolymers , if you mixed , them in different proportion styrene is to M M A use can get 10 is to 90 , 90 is to 10 , 50 is to 50 , so you can get numerous number of copolymers , and also you can choose their different types of , the different sets of monomers .	2.9712845162147175

So basically that tells you , that the number of options in copolymer , if number of co polymers can be synthesis is unlimited .	3.339399987736978

Now you can always argue , that why not just mix , and blend the homopolymers .	3.041580179757928

Take poly A , which is homopolymer , and mix poly B , which is another homopolymer .	3.033038491323899

Unless you .	26.479059959519645

Here also you can actually get numerous numbers of composition , by choosing different A and B , and mixing them in different define ratio , but you know most cases , you cannot make two polymers , to homo polymers .	2.703178440494993

In case of polymers to homopolymers are .	5.257924763035353

In most cases they do not make miscible blends , and as a results , the property of the mixture , of polymer A and polymer B , thus not give you the required property we are looking for .	3.206845859343962

Actually it gives you worst property , then the individual homopolymers , unless you have a mechanism to , comfortablize , or misapplies , or have some sort of interaction between the two homopolymers .	3.545386984951432

And to do that actually you need copolymers , co polymers of .	3.8379349349574023

So what does mean that not only , a require co polymers for improved teramid properties .	2.880632515499507

Teramid properties in a single polymer , but you can utilized this type of block polymer to comprise to homopolymer and next , and make numerous number of blend composition , but in this chain polymers , we will be discussing the chain co polymer , which where we you had mixing a monomer a , and monomer b , from beginning and making copolymers .	2.5783539446947747

We will not discuss this is not a part of this chain copolymerization , where you have make a monomer a , which you polymerized , by living polymerized method , poly A , and then add a second monomer to make poly A and poly B .	3.309982939497556

This is the most common way making block copolymer , but we will not discuss this technique of synthesizing block copolymer in this section .	3.138931962583867

We will be mainly , or exclusively discussing the copolymers , where you start with a mixture of two monomer , and then synthesis the copolymer .	3.5975524462307873

And in this case as we see that , most cases making block copolymer by this method is difficult , so that is why the reason why , is almost cases , this is the processes applied to make block copolymer .	3.5675819745872506

Now continuing with the importance of copolymer for example , if a polystyrene homopolymers , polystyrene homo polymerization is a brittle polymerization , brakes down easily , and also it has poor solvent or chemical resistance .	2.8212536880466907

So to improve of this property of polystyrene , you can actually make a copolymer of polystyrene acrylonitrile , and this actually improves the chemical resistance property of , chemical resistance of over styrene homopolymers .	2.776826282117862

Now this does not improve the brittleness , of the impact properties of polystyrene too much .	3.0616429518882113

So , what is done industrially , you make a rubbery , rubberic code , so you make a rubberic code of poly butadiene .	3.093186990809083

See by emulsion method , you make core , you make take a butadiene , and polymerize in by emulsion method to make a butadiene code , and some of the double bound which has remain unreacted .	2.825239028090336

You can utilize those double bound , and make this copolymers of polystyrene and acrylonitrile , these are the copolymers of polystyrene and acylonitrile P s co A N , this is polystyrene co acylonitrile .	2.5281853387602036

So , basically you can use these as such , or you add blend this two another homopolymer , and because the presents of this rubberic code , which is soft , this actually improves the impact property , because this is the soft impact , it has observe the impacts , and actually makes the polymer material , less brittle compare to either polystyrene , or a ecopolymera polystyrene , and acrynitriles , so these are my example .	2.2317554831180724

This the one example , where you can see that copolymerization techniques are used to improve the properties of polystyrene , by copolymerization with other copolymer , if you have three co monomers basically we use the term third polymer , for the co polymers which are produced in this a a from this three monomers .	3.4369044613122672

For example M 1 is more reactive compare to the M 2 , then in the propagating copolymer chain M 1 will get incorporated , faster rate , in faster rate than in two polymers .	2.8636994399357762

So , as a result what will have if you start each side 50 50 ratio of M 1 and M 2 , you will get eco polymer at the beginning .	3.8026686850968927

At the beginning you will get a copolymer , which will have M 1 greater than 50 percent , and M 2 less than 50 percent , this is in the copolymer , at the beginning .	3.6772093255037768

So , because M 1 is more reactivity , you will get in the chain much faster , so you will get eco polymer , which reach in M 1 compare to M 2 .	3.6992229629031868

So you will have a difference in , the monomers concentration in the copolymer , compared to feed .	5.640815426210366

Now as reaction goes with more and more M 1 is getting incorporated , now first a rate then M 2 .	3.243291103763749

Soon the reaction medium will have less M 1 , because most M 1 monomer then M 2 , because most of the M 1 has get you know , as incorporate , got incorporated in the copolymer chain , so feed monomer concentrations , of M 1 will lower than beginning .	2.978891003481998

As a result the monomer composition in the medium , in the reaction medium , will be different than the beginning .	5.255555163418375

So , now the copolymers which will forms at the later part of your polymerization copolymerization , because the monomer composition in this case , the ratio of M 1 M 2 or different from beginning numbers .	3.555803921411319

The copolymers which will form , which will have different monomer content , then the copolymers which form in the beginning or at the beginning .	3.8794749751197917

So these things will be offering during your copolymerization reaction .	3.2804743178698588

To predict the monomer or the composition of the copolymer , you can look at the polymerization rate of the individual homopolymers , likes for example if you .	5.243666181017754

You can look at the homopolymerization rate of M 1 and M 2 , and from that you can have idea about the homopolymerization , but the homopolymerization data , homopolymerization rate data , actually has very little significance or resiblance with the rate of consumption , or rate of reaction of a monomer during a copolymerization reaction , which means that , if a monomer , the rate at which a monomer ; say M 1 undergo homopolymerization , that could be quite different , when you have M 2 in the reaction medium .	3.0940513985864593

For example , if I take say consider maleic anhydride , we talked about that maleic anhydride or say stilbene .	2.9753043553437126

We talked about in these molecules during our discussion on radical polymerization .	4.126327187080416

Now these monomers , actually do not undergo homopolymerization by itself , we discussed about that , and the reason for that , but they can undergo copolymerization , in fissile by , with other monomers like styrene ethynemethyne and… So , if you have the data , reaction rate data from the homopolymers ; that is not useful when you predict the composition or the reaction rate , when this monomers are reacting with the second co monomers to form a copolymerization .	2.989236082398073

Take another example where if you consider as a vinyl acetate .	5.574317236111529

What happened , homopolymerization become very low , as long as styrene is present , because the copolymerization rate of vinyl acetate with styrene , it is much faster than the homopolymerization .	2.9828945721760407

So as long as styrene is present , vinyl acetate will only form copolymer , and after styrene is over , consume from the reaction medium , then only it actually form homopolymerization .	2.7267236266852373

So from here , also if you look at the homopolymer data of vinyl acetate , and then try to utilize these data to have a idea about the copolymer composition , and the reaction rate between the vinyl acetate and the styrene , that we will be of , very little significance for these copolymerization .	3.4950008107962605

So , basically these homopolymer data rate for this .	3.868710002701677

These individual monomers are not very useful , when we discuss or copolymerization reaction .	4.4184460965317855

So we need to predict , in order to predict the copolymerization composition , what we need to do , we need to construct a kinetic model and the simplest is the terminal model .	3.154119100212524

Now what it says , it says that , the reactivity of a propagating species , only depend on the monomer with unit which is present at the growing chain end .	3.541480741112518

The chemical re reactivity of the propagating chain in a copolymerization , only depends on the monomer unit present at the end of the growing chain , which means that the chemical reactivity of these propagating chain , will only depend upon the reactivity of the M 1 group .	3.700330007384446

Now star could be radical , cations or anion , so this is valid , this terminal model is valid for any initiation process .	3.2217103996238246

To elaborate this if we have say , this two or this two , because in all this cases the terminal group , or the monomer unit which is present at the growing in a same , all these will have same chemical reactivity for propagation reaction , so this is the assumption we are making in the terminal model .	3.1522178147603137

So what are the four possible propagation reactions possible in , during this copolymerization , lets around right those .	3.1982928034320324

So M 1 , star can react with M 1 , M 1 and M 2 are two monomers , produced M 1 , M 1 star can react with M 2 , M 2 to star can react with , M 1 react with .	3.293839383458916

Now this reactions in one and four , where M 1 is reacting with M 1 , and M 2 is reacting with M 2 from the same , see same propagating species , these are called homo propagation or self propagation , and these two , where M 1 in which is reacting with M 2 forming M 2 , these are cross propagation reaction these are , these two are cross propagation , and one and four are homo or self propagation reaction .	2.5952328169591645

Now what is the rate of reaction , or rate at which M 1 is getting incorporated in the copolymer chain .	4.082304765118219

This step one and step three are where M 1 is getting consumed , and getting incorporated in the chain ; see we will write K 1 1 M 1 star M 1 plus K 2 1 M 2 star M 1 , and 1 2 plus K 2 2 into star into .	2.6149345871001555

Now how do .	11.296385304751219

Look at these rate constants , basically the first number represents the radical , sorry the propagating species , where the radical cation or anion it does not matter , so this is first one is from the propagating reacting species , and the second one is for the monomer .	3.175032174466511

So one in the second means M 1 , two is the second means M 2 and so on .	3.427149648530236

Now at any instance , the rate at which M 1 and M 2 is getting incorporated , in the copolymer chain , which will be given by the rate at which , this M 1 and M 2 is getting consumed .	3.554410654094966

So the molar ratio of M 1 and M 2 , in the copolymer at any instance , is given by d M 1 , because this is the rate at which , they are getting consumed , during the reaction .	4.1186219694123185

So you can write the rest of the things from the two expressions , we got in the last one .	4.088269452381466

Now we can apply the study state , where the rate of change of M 1 star is zero ; like we discussed in the case of our chain polymerization , at the steady state the concentration of M 1 and M 2 star remains constant , so rate of change is actually zero at steady state .	3.545959005303496

Now the steps which M 1 is , M 1 star is getting consumed , for in the reaction one , where 1 M 1 star is consuming , getting consumed , and 1 M 1 star is forming , so they are not changing the concentration on M 1 star .	3.394666775164472

In the fourth reaction 1 into star is getting consumed , and 1 into star is getting produced , so they also do not change , this reaction also do not change the concentration of M 2 star .	2.983717996528

So these are the two reaction where in this case ; M 1 is getting M 1 star is getting consumed in M 2 star forming , and in this case M 2 star is getting consumed , and M 1 star is forming .	3.6044687761585315

So we can write down the expressions for M 1 star and M 2 star , is minus K 1 2 , you can do from the expression in the last page , plus K 1 2 , and in case of M 2 this is a step ; step two where M 2 is getting into ties getting produced , and in the step three , where M 2 star is getting consumed .	3.3603463442619392

These are basically two same reactions , so from here we can write K 1 2 M 1 star M 1 .	3.521900592639377

Now , here defining two more term R 1 , which is K 1 1 by K 1 2 , and R 2 K 2 2 by K 2 1 , and if we apply these conditions , steady state condition and use this two expression , then we can write the composition of the two monomers , in the copolymer as this .	3.3150242973700497

Now this expression , which gives the molar ratio of M 1 and M 2 in the copolymer form that any instance , when the monomer concentration in the reaction medium , is M 1 for M 1 , and M 2 for M 2 monomer .	3.736774546512892

Now it is easy to express the concentrations in terms of molar ratio , where F 1 is the molar ratio of pre monomer in the reaction medium , so we can write , this as M 1 M 1 plus M 2 .	3.620333671987883

This is the mole fraction of M 1 in 3 M 1 in the reaction medium , and this is the mole fraction of M 1 in the copolymer , so we can write the d M 1 plus the d M 2 , 1 minus F 2 .	3.9395861879501024

So , you can simply write F 1 is R 1 F 1 , plus F 1 F 2 or F 1 by F 2 is .	2.8030250374479753

Now this expression has been verified for innumerable copolymer systems , and they are , this expression is equally applicable to cationic and anionic and radical copolymerization .	3.1183755847704564

And it is not dependent on the reaction initiation system you are following .	5.340808368947268

Now , these fellow R 1 and R 2 , they are almost independent of the reaction medium , or reaction conditions for radical polymerization , but the values of R 1 and R 2 could be quite different , when you talk about different initiation system , and we will talk about giving a specific example in few minutes .	3.5670336373300393

Now , let us talk about this monomer .	4.572349245249558

In case of radical it has said that at several combination of monomer possible , because we know that most of the monomers we have seen during our discussion , initial discussion in chain polymerization that , most of the vinyl monomers , they do undergo radical polymerization .	3.264987458852965

So hence lot of monomers can be utilized or , can be make utilized to copolymer by radical mechanism .	3.050051105051895

Whereas ionic polymers ; in case of anionic polymers mono monomers selective , it is not every state of two monomers can be utilized for , making ionic copolymerization .	3.672292083089825

They are very selective ; for example if I take a specific example of styrene and acrylonitride .	4.216410696191181

Now this can be copolymerized by radical , it can be copolymerized by anionic , but it cannot be copolymerized by cationic .	3.843645008103545

Whereas if I takes styrene and vinylether , again it can be polymerized by radical , but it cannot be polymerized , because this is , cannot be polymerized by anionic , in this case , it is cannot be polymerized by cationic , but it can be polymerized by cationic polymerization .	3.4144393680458136

So it is said that , you can basically choose any two co monomers , which in most cases can polymerized radically , but if you want to use any of this cationic or anionic technique then the number of pairs of co monomers you can choose are limited , as we discussed in during our chain polymerization discussion .	3.3395746251326304

Now , lets us discuss more about R 1 and R 2 ; as we define R 1 given by K 1 1 by K 1 2 , and R 2 is given by K 2 2 and K 2 1 .	3.449924499093429

Now this is basically the rate at which , this is R 1 , this is the ratio of homo propagation and cross prosperous .	4.797482187064009

This is the homo propagation and this is a cross propagation , and this is also a , this is homo propagation and this is pros propagation .	5.243031820144068

So basically R 1 and R 2 , this is reactivity , monomer reactivity ratio , are the ratios of corresponding homo propagation and cross propagation .	2.7601564563033927

Now R 1 is greater than 1 , then the tendency for homo propagation is more compared to pros propagation , which means that tendency for homopolymer is more than formation of copolymerization , if R 1 is zero , which means there is no tendency of homopolymerization , it is only , it can only undergo copolymerization .	2.951678913610913

If R 1 is 1 , then both are equal ; that means there is no preference were homo propagation and copolymerization , so it completely random copolymer is formed , and if R is less than 1 then the tendency to the co - polymerise , is more than the tendency to homopolymerized .	2.9867112883076725

Now in the expression of R 1 and R 2 , we do not have any rate constant for the termination and initiation reactions , which means that if we talk about that expression .	4.548041746551808

If we talk about this expression , here we do not have any rate constant coming or appearing from initiation reaction , termination reaction and so forth the from the chain transfer reaction as well the , which mean that the rate of initiation or termination or say inivation or chain terminate transfer reactions , do not have any significant on contribution , do not affect the two copolymer composition at all .	2.7278177868535436

So basically if you talk about different radical mechanism ; for example if you talk about , radical initiation by thermal initiation , or a photochemical initiation , or say redox reaction in initiation .	2.9855714548914043

In all those cases as long as your M 1 and M 2 are same , the composition in the copolymer would be same , irrespective of the initiation mechanizing you have applied , and also it does not depends upon whether there is presence or absence of chain transfer reactions in the medium or not , but as I said that if the mode of initiation , like whether its anionic cationic or radical , that change , then obviously the composition of the two monomers in the co polymers will change .	3.204586016727257

And as you can understand that the , polarity of the solvent in which you are doing the reaction , and that will effect more when you have a ionic chain co polymerization , compare to when you have a radical chain co polymerization .	4.470417914249392

Now let us talk about different types of co polymerization , and corresponding chain micro structures ; types of co polymerization and corresponding chain micro structure .	2.453137265919649

Now , let us talk about the first case , where we talked about ideal co polymerization .	4.296283747676463

In this case , R 1 multiplied by R 2 is 1 or R 2 is 1 by R 1 , we can write k 2 2 by K 2 1 K 1 2 K 1 1 .	3.1595196742133007

Now , this gives you the reaction with , the ratio , or the relative reaction of M 2 dot M 2 star , with M 1 , M 2 and M 1 , and this keeps M 1 .	3.8454952955382313

Now , if i consider this value as two , let us consider this value , which means that M 2 star will react twice as faster with M 2 , compare to M 1 , so does M 1 star , M 1 star also will react with M 2 , twice as fast at it reacts with M 1 .	2.6780899391109045

So , respective of which propagating species you have in the reaction medium , it is always the reaction with M 2 will be faster , and M 2 will more reactive than M 1 .	3.6799060932689494

Or other sense , M 2 , if you talk about reverse way , M 2 will be more reactive , towards both m star and M 1 star , which means that the rate , relative rates at which , two monomers incorporative in the co polymer chains , are the same , irrespective of the identity , of the unit , which is present at the end of propagating species .	2.973383900734398

So , relative rates at which M 2 and M 1 is getting incorporated in the chain , copolymer chain is independent of which is present at the end , and the addition of , or incorporation M 2 in the copolymer chain is unbiased ; that means , whether M 2 will get added next M 2 star , or M 1 star , are statistically same .	2.7908039533957707

So , they will , the sequence distribution of this case of the repeat unit in this copolymers is random , so you will get .	4.04265352530483

You will make this the copolymer at the beginning , you will get more numbers M 2 is getting incorporated in the polymer copolymer chain , but the M 2 , addition of M 2 M 1 will be complete random .	3.4113011038159815

So , which we have random distribution of , or sequence of the copolymer , and also M 2 ; this is a , M 2 is , or F 2 in this case , F 2 is higher than F 1 , if R 2 is higher than R 1 .	3.935494208609597

Now , we can simply write R 1 , and R 2 is 1 , and used as in this expression , this expression , and we can right F 1 R 1 F 1 and R 1 F 1 plus F 2 .	3.3717134854436868

Now a special case , where R 1 and R 2 is 1 , what happen again .	4.3180448810762515

In this case as we discussed earlier that , tendency to homo propagate , and tendency to cross propagate is same , so what happen .	3.0338559549531827

Again M 1 and M 2 will get in incorporated randomly in the copolymer chain , and F 1 would be same as F 1 , and F 2 would be same as F 2 , because the reactivities , the monomer reactive ratio of this two are same , and they are one .	3.1858135548630924

So , obviously , the rate at which M 1 and M 2 getting incorporated in a co polymer chain , are same as their ratio in the monomer field .	3.5048573670217897

So , if I want to plot ; say F 1 versus F 1 ; that is the , 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 , this is correspondence to the 20 percent composition of monomer aim in the , free monomer in the reactions mixture .	3.2522068507315085

Now when R 1 and R 2 is R 1 is R 2 is 1 .	5.449506742155907

Now , whatever the composition in the feed ; that is also in the copolymer you have ; this is a the 0.1 , this a 0.5 , this is a 2 , and this is 10 , r is 0.1 , R is 0.2 and 10 R 1 .	5.795502082390406

So , in this case , because the reactivity of monomer m is lower , they get incorporated much lower rate , than monomer m 2 , where if the higher rate , reaction reactivity of M 1 is higher compare to reactivity of m 2 , that M 1 and incorporated in much faster rate compared to in m 2 .	2.449008741771186

Now this cross a similar to the vapor liquid equilibrium of ideal liquid mixtures , so that is why , that is from where this name of ideal has come .	2.764661258822196

Now next we will talk about , the second case .	7.735754450291613

This was we discussed case number a , and next talk about case number b , where we have R 1 and R 2 is 0 , so either we can R 1 and R 2 is both are zero .	2.677110913086867

In this case , you can , R 1 is as we said K 1 by K 2 by , and R 2 is K 2 2 by k 2 1 , obviously in both the monomer M 1 M 2 , there is no tendency to homopolimerise , so they there will only form copolymer .	2.897371673943309

So , M 1 will only react with M 2 star , and M 2 only react with M 1 star , only the cross propagation happen , which means you have copolymer of this type .	3.1835075778054716

M 1 star will only react with M 2 , and m 2 star will only react with M 1 and so on , so you have a perfectively alternate copolymer , just alternate arrangement of the monomers , and F 1 and F 2 both will be fifty percent in this case .	3.394792989335271

So , as long as there is 1 monomer is left in the reaction continue , and once 1 of the monomer get consumed , the reaction will stopped there , because the second monomer even if that is present in the reaction medium , that cannot participate in the homopolymerisation , so reaction is not proceed further .	3.3691467153733967

So , if you plot F 1 verses F 2 , no matter what is the concentration of F 1 , you always get fifty percent incorporation in the copolymerstion , this can be achieved , also if 1 of the monomer is , R 1 is zero , reactivity is zero , it could be rather way on , R 2 is , 1 is 0 .	3.0692188843851107

If R 1 , or it could be R 1 and R 2 both are near to zero .	4.05453676741994

So in this case what happened it do not get a perfect alternate , if for example if I take the case of R 1 , greater than zero and R 2 zero , then M 2 star only can react with M 1 star .	3.5273787281833724

In most cases , it will be alternating , but there will be some cases , there will be two M 1 and three M 1 sitting next to next each other .	3.4216857675203984

So , it is essentially alternate copolymer with some random incorporation of , or statistically incorporation of M 1 , because in that case , where some tendency to homo polymer , M 1 , because R 1 is higher than zero ; that is not exclusively participate in cross propagation , this sometime can participating homopolymers , homopropogation , so you will get essentially a alternate copolymer , but some cases will , some incorporation of M 1 .	2.3585461691460075

Now there is a third case , where R 1 and R 2 not equal to zero or not equals to 1 .	4.0450506663601775

Now , you can have situations like R 1 greater than 1 , R 2 less than 1 or vice versa , or R 1 less than 1 or closer than 1 , R 1 greater than 1 , R 2 greater than 1 .	2.586173650025793

So , what will they do in next lecture , we will start form this case , and talk about types of copolymer it forms , and the microstructure of that resulting copolymers , and also talk about composition drift in this copolymerstion medium and copolymerstion reaction , and also talk about the reactivity .	2.9492292237287283

To with this , we just stop into this lecture , so we will come back , and continue this discussion on chain copolymerization in next lecture .	3.46241403750934

Welcome back to this portion of polymer chemistry and into this 19th lecture , I am going to cover rest of the discussion on anionic chain polymerization , and then I will start our discussion on chain copolymerization .	3.2801625525599505

In this lecture , we will try to cover anionic chain polymerization , which we started in the last lecture and will complete our discussion on termination reactions and then touch upon the kinetics of anionic chain polymerization and also the molecular weight in this type of polymerization .	4.269994894306436

And then talk about briefly about the practical aspects of anionic chain polymerization and then we will start this chain copolymerization , which I will continue in the next lecture as well .	3.477382699848572

Now , let us recap the lecture we had in the last time lecture 18 , where we talked about the cationic chain polymerization of kinetic and energetics and we started our discussion on anionic chain polymerization and we talked about general features of ionic chain , anionic chain polymerization and different types of propagation , initiation , mechanisms , propagation and we just studied a few examples by which anionic chain polymerization can be terminated .	3.1832933372763175

Now , let us go back and just look at the initiation process once again .	4.283837787445381

In anionic polymerization , we , we had discussed two types , mainly two types of initiator , one was organo - metallic compounds and another was electron transfer through electron transfer reaction .	2.6984866786475377

Now , recollect from our discussion from last time , that we had .	4.761622805904887

This had given example of butyl lithium , which is the very strong electrophile .	4.51090405512874

So , the monomers , which does not propagate , which the monomers do not propagate with the very highly strongly stabilized anion , we required this , this strongly nucluophilic anion and this can be utilized to initiate anionic polymerization of styrene , isoprene .	2.6513173914107195

And initiator like this , which are medium nucleiophic , they can be utilized to initiate monomers like .	4.0340393749150545

And this type of initiators , which are weakly , very weak nucleophiles , they can be utilized to initiate a very strongly or highly stabilized propagating anions , like cyanoacylate , acylate , because cyanoacylate has two stabilizing groups .	2.4843055034450887

This has this , the propagating anion from cyanoacylate is highly stabilized , so you can actually anionically polymerize these cyanoacylate monomers with a weekly , very weak nucleophiles .	2.4960092218476713

So , you can also polymerize with strong nucleophiles as well , but this type of monomers can be polymerized anionically by weak , very weak nucleophiles .	2.9872623642120257

Now , we talked about this electron transfer initiation by , for example , gave this sodium and naphthalene and we talked about propagation step and how propagation step depends on the solvent polarity .	3.246429091158474

And we started our discussion on termination reaction for anionic polymerization .	3.999424083381566

Now , you can recollect from our discussion , that its anionic polymerization , you have no bimolecular termination and in fact , in absence of any side reaction , if you have taken care of the condition , reaction condition in such a way , that no impurities are present and you have taken care of all the other purity aspects , then most of this anionic polymerization , actually , actually propagate without termination .	3.0772303862127472

So , this anionic polymerization mainly happen without termination , as long as termination , as long you has have inert atmosphere and extremely clean glassware analyzing skills .	2.5295181851431203

So , extreme care should be taken to remove this O 2 , CO 2 type impurities .	3.1796820339680005

Now , you can deliberately , in most cases laboratory , we do terminate a propagating anion by adding some external reagent .	2.841170461507498

For example , if we add a polystyrene anion , we can add water and this chain gets terminated and you get OH minus , which is , this is a very weakly nucleophile , so it cannot further initiate anionic chain .	3.184314702370629

So , reaction actually gets terminated in these steps .	4.6011834339408155

Now , utilizing this concept you can actually synthesize functionalized polymers , which are also called telechelic polymers , which we discussed in the last class .	3.6699245247804697

For example , if you terminate , say I write a general expression , expression for a vinyl polymer and we terminate by carbon dioxide and then acidify the reaction medium , you get carboxylic acid .	2.654279019517768

You do the same thing , say , with ethylene oxide and then acidify , you get alcohol .	3.5308192277978123

Now , you can even functionalize this by such reagent and here you can make a polymer with a functional group at the end , so it can be utilized .	4.446905466176597

This polymer , which is also known as macromonomer because it can act as a monomer and start polymerization once more time physically with micromolecules behaving like monomers , so we often call this as a macromonomer .	2.8898010558548055

So , you can create in this way macromonomer , which you can utilize for further polymerization .	3.9522990458285014

Now , you can synthesize telechelic polymers by taking an initiator , which is already functional group .	3.6573966737497265

For example , if I take a tri methyl silyl protected .	3.0835673656072657

Now , you can initiate a polymer chain and at the end you can terminate the chain and then by acid hydrolysis you can make a interminated polymer .	4.175355822613759

So , using this termination reaction , with a definite reagent you can actually create , you can terminate and as well , you can create the functional group at the end of the polymers , polymer chain , which is very useful and which can be utilized for several other applications .	3.7622859387382324

You can take help of couplic reaction and you can make four arm in case , say , four arm star polymer .	2.9632730411548613

So , these are the examples by which you know , these are examples how you can utilize the anionic polymers and can make , functionalize and the , and polymers of having different geometallic mineral .	2.814308532658346

You make , as we have discussed several times in last lecture , that you can utilize this end and if you have , add a next second monomer , you actually make block copolymer as well .	3.8555539564961343

See , if you can , if you take this type of chain and you add second monomer B , then you can make a block copolymer .	4.924267537434569

Now , in anionic polymerization , this , lot of side reactions can happen by which , by which the polymer chain can get terminated .	4.228478145935299

And especially , if added for polar monomers , for example if I take an acrylate , and let us consider a propagating chain and it can actually abstract hydrogen .	3.7256304631669908

And can , this chain can get terminated and you can form , this can now reinitiate the polymers by which it can form branches .	3.9833197208320446

So , this one chain terminates , gets terminated by this side reaction and you can form branch in other growing chain .	3.253869591726273

Now , that is not applicable for monomers like methacrylates where this hydrogen is absent , but methacrylates actually can participate in several side reactions .	2.756797448319099

For example , if I write this , say , place an example of methyl methacrylate , this is the chain end where you have a .	4.7536787905126925

Now , it can actually form a cycle and it can knock out this methoxy and terminate this chain .	3.1979444002932795

So , I can write now , this is a dead chain , so the chain gets terminated and this is a weak nucleophile , as we discussed earlier .	4.80293816617819

So , it actually often cannot reinitiate anionic polymerization and even it does , it actually slowed down the reaction a significant way .	2.8227661825421313

Now , another side reaction , which is very possible , very prominent in case of methyl methacrylate is as follows , is actually reaction on the monomer , not on the polymer .	3.805851465479793

Now , it can do a substitution reaction here , substitution nucleophilic reaction here and form again a methoxy group here .	3.0776751059397447

Now , this , this is the different monomer all together compared to the original methyl methacrylate monomer .	4.935582832438112

So , basically , now if the polymer start , it is actually the copolymer of methyl methacrylate and this , this monomer and also , not only it makes a copolymer , the reaction also gets significantly slowed down again because of the weak nucleophicity of this anion , generated anion .	2.9599736319525483

Now , if the reaction is slow , slowed down , then the dispersity problems comes , you know the polymer has become much broader and the heaviness becomes difficult to maintain , so there strategies , which are utilized to minimize this side reactions is especially for the polar monomers .	2.559706637471955

We discussed for examples , for example like for methacrylates .	4.335334118851514

Now , if to slow down this reaction one strategy is used very often is to make a bulk .	3.482468857131465

You take a bulky anion initiator , so that spherically , this reaction , this substitution reaction becomes problematic .	2.9653979081028345

So , this , this reaction , this side reaction becomes difficult .	5.874558553706175

For example , instead of taking butyl lithium , this is taking buthyl lithium , if you take a bulky lithium group like 1 , diphenyl hexyl lithium or say , cumyl lithium .	2.5405274774817244

Now , in this case , because this groups , this R group in this case are very larger in size , this S , this side reaction of substitution nucleophilic reactions becomes slow down difficult , so you can actually suppress this side reaction .	2.7547321098615942

If you think about the side reaction , that intra - molecular cyclization reaction , which is discussed here and now fortunately , the activation energy for this reaction , activation for only for this reaction is higher compared to the normal propagation reaction .	3.256902144538055

So , you can take advantage of that difference in activation energy and you can decrease the temperature .	4.733523298357671

But because activation energy for this cyclic reaction is higher , so the drop in the rate of this cyclic reaction is much much higher compared to the normal propagation reaction .	4.117919259477984

So , in that way you can actually minimize this side reaction .	4.970166843554776

And another way to minimize this sort of size reaction is to use little polar molecular , polar solvent like THF .	3.187139696091723

In that case you get solvent separated anions , initiator molecules .	3.70038841767656

So , you can actually combine these three strategies , like using polar molecular , polymer solvent like THF , THF and do reaction in much lower temperature , say like at minus 78 degree centigrade and use bulky initiator .	2.594357068184333

So , by using these three strategies you can actually minimize this side reaction from methyl methacrylate and carry out addition anionic polymerization for methyl methacrylate and this similar sort of strategy can be applied for other polar monomers as well .	2.7545569790742492

Now , as we have been talking , that this anionic polymerization proceeds without termination , but that does not mean , that this anionic chain ends , leave forever , not there are some intrinsic self - termination steps possible , which are actually very slow and extremely slow .	2.610112802984996

So , in normal time frame you can call those reactions absent , but during a longer time frame those reaction could be significant and then by that process , that termination , the chain could be terminated .	2.243561916652235

For example , if we take this electron transfer for initiation reaction of styrene .	3.736402062258343

Now , you have seen , now it can undergo hydride elimination and form an ionic end .	4.168669940716543

Now this actually can , this is a very acidic proton , so it can be easily abstracted by an anion , which could be another chain end , the styrile chain end .	3.725711568786126

So , this proton can be abstracted by another propagating chain end and form.. ... Now , this is unreactive molecule , so this is one example by which , that polystyrile anion is self - terminating and finally ending into unreactive or terminated polymer chain , but these reactions are very slow .	2.605052059449949

As you can see , hydride elimination is always slow and if you compare with a cationic polymerization we talked about , in that case it was actually proton elimination , which was much , comparably much easier things to happen .	3.2337982408591657

So , in comparison to cationic polymerization and anionic polymerization , anionic polymerization , anionic chain ends are much more stable compared to a cationic chain end .	4.195702471083732

So , anionic , in anionic chain polymerization you actually consider , that this polymerization happen without any practical termination steps .	3.4609200220700758

Now , let us talk about this kinetics of anionic polymerization Now , before we go in details , lets us recap what we learned in anionic polymerization , so that our kinetic understanding will become easier .	2.7400311089830462

Now , we know that in case of anionic polymerization the initiation is faster .	5.057364629984656

Now , remember the discussion we had for radical , this polymerization , radical chain polymerization , where the initiation steps is much slower compared to propagation step , but in this case , this anionic polymerization , the initiation steps are much much faster compared to propagation steps .	3.381556427217011

So , each initiator generates and also , each initiator , if you are talking about organic butane lithium or say , sodium and naphthalene electron transfer reaction , each initiator molecules actually generates single carbanionic center , active center .	2.5428435917253585

So , basically number of moles of initiator is basically , will produce same number of moles of polymers at the end of the reaction .	3.5210187714880283

So , chains are initiated all at once because initiation steps are much faster .	3.1404358748318253

All the chains are initiated , all the chains are initiated at a go , so this all starts together and all the initiator actually gets consumed before propagation reaction actually starts .	2.688112080572813

And as you can now visualize , that all the chains , now after initiation is complete all the chains will grow simultaneously under identical condition .	3.274162464029917

And unless we have impurities , all we want to stop or terminate the reaction by adding some agent , they , there is no termination reaction .	3.505652731809154

Actually , there is no or very little de - polymerization reaction depending on of sling temperature of the polymer as well .	4.225402566896062

So , what , so we can write , that k i is much higher than k p , rate constant for the polymerization and rate of polymerization , which is again the standard way of writing k p .	4.034501199918134

So , we can write monomer concentration and the concentration of all the anionic , which is present in the reaction medium .	4.404999345041364

So , what is M minus ?	6.274379273283415

The concentration of all the anionic species , which is present in the reaction .	5.3711819581527624

It is same , it is same as the initiator concentration because as we discussed , that each initiator actually initiates one chain , so the concentration of the anions would be same as the concentration of the initiator molecules .	3.941029585742547

Now , this expression is satisfactory for , for homogenous and reactions in polar medium .	3.046722689994704

In non - polar medium what happens ?	7.319873714442141

There is a possibility that the initiator molecules can aggregate .	4.984379027955395

For example , if you take a butyl lithium in non - polar medium , you can actually aggregate , and , and that depends on which butyl lithium group you are taking and number vary from 4 to 6 or something .	3.181550607692678

So , what , what is to do ?	5.524222660960573

Remember , that if , if you take a very non - polar medium or hydrocarbon medium , then this initiator molecules can actually aggregate effectively reducing the concentration of the available initiator , which means this you have to compensate or you have to take care of that correction in the concentration of initiator term to actually get the rate of polymerization .	3.6373216813220624

And as you can , you can visualize or you can explain that because there is no termination reaction and the generation of initiator or the initiation is much faster , the concentration of this anion , anionic species are much higher than a radical polymerization .	4.049720218535349

For example , concentration of anionic species is almost like 10 to the power of 5 times higher than M dot in a radical chain polymerization , which makes R p for anionic is much higher than R p for radical and that is why this anionic reactions get over in very short time , even in few seconds .	2.916879045863851

Sometimes the reaction is so faster , that in a fraction of seconds this polymerization is completed .	4.520652226268833

Now , what is the effect of solvent ?	6.737359124868302

We have discussed earlier , that the solvent plays a very important role in , in terms of rate of polymerization of this ionic polymerization , especially in case of anionic polymerization .	4.354169708443318

They could exist depending upon the polarity of the medium .	3.9405401644983824

They can exist in different state of aggregation and that state , that state of aggregation will be , will definitely determine the reactivity of the anionic groups at the same end .	3.004666170109939

If this is , this is the ion - pairs are totally separated , they are free ion - pairs .	4.965400577540943

Obviously , the reactivity of the ions , end ions are higher , so the R p will be higher compared to if the ion - pairs are in contact , or will be tight in case of , if you have considered same solvent , same say , non - polar solvent .	3.3889859860400935

The cationic , in case of cationic polymerization , the ions are not as tight as in case of anionic polymerization because the size of the counter ions , like lithium , butyl lithium case or some , they are small , so the anions and the canions , cation in case of anionic polymerization are much more tight .	3.1866814678436386

So , for a given solvent , especially non , non - polar solvent , the rate of cationic polymerization is higher compared to anionic polymerization , is about 2 to 3 times higher and because in case of anions , anionic polymerization , they are in non - polar medium , they are tight .	3.9267271598725753

So , effect of solvent polarity , if we increase the polarity , for polarity for both cases , cationic and anionic , the effect in case of anionic polymerization is much higher because to begin with , they are much tight and if you increase the polarity , they can be free .	3.5573589580760143

So , the reactivity goes up and if we talk about the effect of counter ion , so let us consider first the polar solvent .	4.463561577162508

If you consider polar solvent , that means , the ions are either solvent separated or they are free anion and in that case , the salvation , the separation ion , separation is , is , is more feasible for a small ion like lithium , a small cation for lithium because lithium will be much more solvated in a polar solvent compared to a larger size ion , cation , like cesium cation or a potassium cation .	2.526720348544153

So , if you are talking about a polar solvent , then small counter ion , counter cation will help in separating those ion - pairs and hence the reaction will be to go up and in the case of non - polar solvent where the ions , the anion , carbanion and the counter ion are tight , then it is , if it is the size is higher , the , the ions are little loose , so the reactions is higher .	3.2781147744819004

So , in case of , in case of polar solvent for a given anion , lithium will , lithium cation will have a higher reactivity than sodium and potassium , cesium , and in a non - polar medium it would be , order would be reverse .	3.3264088289166813

Now , what is the temperature of the reaction ?	6.993600088805259

In case of anionic polymers it is little complicated and it is not very generic way .	5.591713337035034

You can actually explain the effect of temperature in case of anionic polymerization .	4.785930831709178

It depends upon the ion - pair and the solvent , on the polarity of the solvent , but to say , at least , that in polar solvent you have .	3.43055782222926

What happens if you increase the polar solvent , polarity of the solvent ?	5.4677736699736

The contact ion - pair gets separated and this process , by this process the ion individual ions gets solvated and as a result , its exothermic process .	2.9287548396416776

Now , say , exothermic process , if you increase the temperature , the ions would be preferred to left hand side , which means , the ions will be moved towards tight ion - pairs sides , you know , comparatively .	3.069746876903221

As I said , all these are , these ion - pair aggregation are in equilibrium , they are always a very fast equilibrium , equilibrium exists between these two , say solvent separated ion - pair .	2.688951912076142

So , if you increase the temperature what happens ?	5.069438526959095

This , this goes to left hand side , so in by and increase the proportion of contact ion - pair in this equilibrium and by that it decreases the rate of the reaction in non - polar solvent .	3.480765138986218

Basically , there is no salvation , so del h is 0 , so basically the temperature has minimal effect in terms of reaction rate .	4.04422992436895

Sometimes what happened in case of non - polar solvent , this aggregation of the initiator molecules , for example , like butane lithium , we just talked about the non - polar medium , butane lithium could be existing in an aggregated form .	3.472505231444564

The aggregation is less , so as a result if you decrease the temperature the aggregation become less , so the reaction become faster , so the reaction rate goes up .	3.9043014735234203

So , in both cases , actually , decreasing the temperature actually might give you better , a higher reaction rate .	3.060069459771101

So , we have now discussed , that kinetics , the rate of reaction in case of anionic polymerization .	4.2187594694249935

And let us talk about the molecular weight of , molecular weight of the resulting polymers in , in an anionic polymerization .	4.952065978178518

Now , we know , for a chain polymerization how you define the molecular rate , if we calculate , these are moles of monomers consumed divided by the moles of polymer chains produced .	3.793185787252422

The moles of monomer , monomer chains , monomer consumes is given by the conversion multiplied by initiator in initial concentration of the monomer , whereas the moles of polymer chains is nothing but the moles of initiator molecules present at the beginning .	3.4836663027789334

Now , we will have to add a factor k , the k is 1 for case of initiation , where each initiator molecules forming one chain , like butyl lithium case , organ butyl lithium case , where each initiator molecules are actually forming one chain .	2.7210131699778164

Now , in case of electro - transfer initiation , 2 , remember , that the sodium - naphthalene case , actually 2 initiator molecules are forming 1 chain , so you have to multiply a factor 2 for that .	2.948688315138541

So , electro , normal the most cases k is 1 and there are cases like the initiation by the electron transfer reaction where you have biradical , a chain goes from both the sides , so basically the number of chains actually become half effectively .	3.2332742379297543

So , the molecular weight becomes twice , so k is 2 for initiation by electron transfer initiation .	3.733488600509739

If , if you have monomers , which , whose ceiling temperature , like alpha methyl styrene , alpha methyl styrene , which are very few where , whose ceiling temperature is very low , then you cannot just use this as such , then you have to consider the depolymerization reaction as well .	3.5644586260865987

But in most of the cases , this ceiling temperature is quite high compared to our reaction temperature .	4.00583726475696

So , those depolymerization reaction do not contribute at all , so we do not have to worry about the backward reaction .	3.047541905441842

So , we can use this expression to determine the number average degrees of polymerization in an ionic polymerization .	4.264419173649519

Now , what about the polydispersity ?	6.664567163239516

M w by M n , now this remains very narrow , say , less than 1.05 , something like that .	3.253799153874366

It remains very narrow as long as your initiation rate is much faster compared to propagations , so all the chains actually start .	3.3046319938280315

As long as we maintain this , this happens , then all the chains starts from same time and proceed or propagate for same time , so the polydispersity becomes very narrow and so , as long as you maintain or the reaction have initiation reaction is faster compared to propagation reaction .	2.6864452950360658

Now , also there is no termination reaction , if your , if your termination reaction , then number of chains would increase , then the expected one and as a result , your polidispersity would go up .	3.0608825597256777

So , as long as we maintain pure environment where you reduce or minimize or make no termination reaction and your initiation rate is much faster compared to propagation step , then you can actually get assured , that the polydispersity in anionic polymerization would be very narrow , so less than 1.05 .	2.625250401202012

So , let us now compare few practical considerations .	3.9558301255994377

Now , we know , that we , we know , that we actually know all this things , but just to conclude this anionic polymerization part , but in practice what we need to do as we have seen , that the anionic polymerization is very susceptible to the impurities presents like oxygen , carbon dioxide , water , where if the moisture present , it immediately will kill the , kill the anion , carbanion .	2.745151754912552

So , you have to be very careful , not having any presence of the , this impurities .	4.676498689045383

All the reagents , which are using monomers and initiator must be extremely pure , there should not be any other impurities because anionic , anionic , carboanions are very reactive , so they can , they can actually get react , they can actually react with the impurities and get terminated .	2.7596569597665974

Now , to create an inert atmosphere , which typically use nitrogen and argon in the lab , so the nitrogen and argon you are using in the lab to create an inert atmosphere , that has to be extremely dry without moisture and extremely pure and that is a really challenging job for the scientist who actually practice this anionic polymerization .	2.5161661170798166

There are several columns by through which they send these gases before they actually can utilize this gases to pure the inert atmosphere in the reaction , in the reaction environment .	3.144711495806226

And your glasswares has to be cleaned in an , in practice they actually , the , the , the scientist who actually carry out anionic polymerization reaction , they actually film dry , which means , they actually heat the glasswares under flame and then apply vacuum continuously .	2.262298248905926

So , anything , any oxygen , any moisture , which was absorbed or any impurities , which is , they are in the surface of the glassware , they get , they get cleaned up .	2.78501252613793

So , as you can now recognize , that it is not a very simple reaction to carry out in a large scale , in industrial scales , where maintaining all these purity , all these reaction conditions are very difficult as also this reactions are typically down .	3.3492497807681003

So , maintaining in a large scale industrial set up is quite difficult .	3.675249139399937

So , as you expect , that commercial applications of anionic chain polymerization are limited and they are not used for making any polymers , used for making many polymers and they are only utilized for making specifically copolymers and , and some molecular standards , where we require very narrow dispersion , which you can utilize for using standards , as molecular standards , which you can use for molecular weight determination .	3.0657268860231146

So , then end of this module of chain polymerization , let us conclude with just a few basic comparison between the radical and anionic chain polymerization we studied .	3.415175189407533

And you know , that anionic polymerization is very susceptible to impurities , whereas radical chain polymerization are also sensitive are susceptible , but not to that extent of this ionic polymerization .	3.140315537162571

And ionic chain polymerization is very sensitive to solvent polarity , as we discussed from last week ’ s lectures and especially for anionic polymerization .	3.2359910338421614

Radical polymerizations are not sensitive in general , but there are some polar monomers , which can be sensitive to solvent polarity , but in general radical , as long as the monomers are soluble in the solvent you are using , your reaction should proceed well .	3.14758751753724

Ionic reactions are generally carried out at ambient or lower temperature .	3.6998299578415423

As we have discussed , activation energy for radical reactions are much higher compared to the ionic group , ionic polymerization , which are very low and sometimes negative .	4.082106183328176

So , as a result , radical polymerization is done at comparably higher temperature and typically higher than 50 degree centigrade in the lab and the industry .	3.6500846513992715

And this is obvious , that radical scavengers stops , radical inhibits radical polymerization whereas it has no effect on ionic polymerization and this is , this is what , why you take trouble of all these reaction conditions for ionic polymerization .	2.873816189104398

These ionic polymerizations can be easily employed to tailor - made copolymers , like block copolymers , anionic polymers , which have a very niche applications where you do not need any larger quantity , but in small .	3.0559812623191154

If you require small amount , then you can utilize this anionic polymerization or cationic polymerization , especially anionic polymerization , which are very useful to making block copolymer go with this .	3.511236167711686

We come to the end of this module on chain polymerization .	5.3668456873866

What we now start is chain copolymerization , so let us start our discussion on chain copolymerization .	3.163041507105202

Now , you remember , when we talk about step polymers , give example how you make a step copolymerization , if you have , say , two different acids , di - acids , you can react with diol and make a polyester and in that case it is a copolyester because it has got R dash and it actually consists of two monomers , two different di - acids .	3.1141370084529427

Now , as you anticipate or you realize , that in case of step copolymers the final co , copolymer should have same monomer , same ratio of the monomers as in the feed because as we know , that to make a high , high molecular polymer in case to step polymerization , the conversation has to be close to 100 percent and if its conversation is 100 percent , all the monomers actually are in polymer .	3.073386534845704

So , what is the feed ratio of the different monomers has to be same as in the polymers as a copolymers as well .	5.6986423295051685

And we also know , that chain step polymers actually is equilibrium polymerization , where the reaction is slow and different tapes are different sizes of polymer or polymers are in equilibrium .	2.9088993285158358

So , at the end , you will variably land up in a random copolymer , random arrangement of these two monomers , two functional , two monomers unless specific tapes where the reactions rates are very high .	3.1001763799081905

For example , reactions between acid chloride and alcohol and if you take out that , if you take out the resulting polymer from the solution , then there is a possibility , that you can get the arrangement of this two monomers other than random .	4.722769777566548

For example , block in block nature , but in normal cases , in normal case , step polymer always gives you random copolymer .	2.750977391119025

What happens in cases of chain copolymerization ?	5.575334703799462

Say , if you start with two monomers , M 1 , M 2 , you can have M 3 , then typically we write , terpolymer , and that mostly three types of arrangement .	3.065167619474638

So , if you consider M 1 and M 2 , this three types of copolymers , you can have , which I think I have discussed in the first lecture , introduction one , these M 1 and M 2 , the two monomers can get into the copolymer chain , statistically following a statistical law and one of the laws could be the Bernoullian statistics , which is basically nothing but the random arrangements of this molecules without any bias .	3.222266968190291

So , like there is no bias on the incorporation of the two monomers one after one , so there could be other statistical law , which the monomers can follow , but this small example , which actually gives a complete random arrangement of these two monomers .	3.271366534422938

So , this is statistical copolymer and this particular case of , which is lot of time to make this two as equivalent , but they are not , in true sense they are not equivalent , random copolymers are not always statistical copolymers , but of course statistical copolymers are random copolymers .	2.787395246664781

Only the statistical , statistical copolymers , which follow this law , they are called random copolymers , which are very common anywhere .	3.420983395503183

Most of statistical copolymers are random copolymers , but not always .	3.4753216953054062

The second type is alternate copolymer where you have alternate , exactly alternate arrangement of this two monomer and third is block , block copolymer where you have a significant longer chain of say , M 1and a significantly longer chain of M 3 .	3.0475671432831235

It could be repetition of this , one polymer chain could have several blocks , but this length should be significantly higher so that we can call them block .	2.6805461543693783

Now , block copolymers also could be different types , like linear , the type we just showed .	3.5157357077426425

It could be graft , graft block copolymer where basically one chain all form M 1 and with side chain of M 2 it could have brass arrangement where basically , where project into two - dimensional where you have surface of a , and the brasses are hanging of the other monomers .	2.4867860841779277

So , you can basically extend this graft polymer into another dimension to get brass copolymer .	2.6155685231107597

Now , why do we need co polymer ?	4.606885503410404

What is the utility , importance ?	7.182516056259027

Now , with a homopolymer , with all the examples , we talked about polystyrene , poly methyl methaculate , polyvinyl acetenol and all these things , actually you can , the options are very , very few , in true sense you can have only a set a homopolymers , not much .	2.888030555443346

You can actually name a lot of homopolymers , but they are , they are , that all the homopolymers , so your options are limited with homopolymers .	3.088994444984846

If you make copolymers , if you take M 1 and M 2 , then you can choose from that monomer set and get several combination of M 2 , M 1 and M 2 and not only that , for a given set of two monomers you can make different compositions , 0 100 , 10 90 to 90 10 and different compositions of , not only you have choices of choosing two different monomers from a state of monomers , also you have choice of making different composition of this copolymer .	2.9301070718727233

So , basically there is a unlimited number of polymers , you can , copolymers you can make or polymers you can make by using copolymer .	4.318551463690794

Now , you can argue that you can mix this homopolymers or make a blend .	3.736845512753211

You can always argue , that ok , I have all those homopolymers , now I can mix them in different proportions to get the composition of what I want , which will finally give the same composition , which you might get in the copolymers .	2.8615827908726943

But what happen if you start with two different homopolymers and mix them ?	4.321837220928567

Lot of time they do not mix , you know , we will talk about , maybe , later , later part of the this course , that polymers usually , hike , high molecular polymers , they do not exactly mix well .	3.483641285573149

So , what happens ?	8.646089926521524

You require a combination of homopolymer or combination of monomers .	4.157956100080713

So , to get an average or to improve properties , so what we will do ?	3.5102215253888205

We will start from this importance part in the next lecture and we will talk about the details of chain copolymerization in the next lecture .	3.7506754956374073

Welcome back to this 15th lecture of the Polymer Chemistry course .	3.1858207006467407

I should say that , welcome to the 15th lecture of this polymer chemistry course , and in this course in this lecture today , we will continue our discussion on polymer polymerization processes , different processes we start discussing in the last lecture .	3.1314568560329383

And then we will talk about in little detail about emulsion polymerization , and then we will begin in this lecture or sort of introduce the concept of living radical polymerization in this lecture .	3.775375461833824

And we found that in most cases it will increase the temperature , the polymerization rate goes up and thermal molecular weight also comes down , except the case of growth of polymerization .	4.410226010167737

And we discussed the effect of pressure , on the rate of polymerization molecular weight in very briefly , and we talked about thermodynamics of chain growth polymers , we talked about the ceiling temperature , and relations between ceiling temperature and the monomer concentration at equilibrium .	4.104475416568318

And then we talked about the dependence of monomer structure on the value or the values of the del h and del s , the enthalpy change and the entropy change , how that those values depend on the structure of the monomer depending upon how the double bond in a monomer is stabilized or the polymer is strained or not .	3.4910668770839837

And then we just began with different processes of making polymers , by radical chain polymerization , and we talked about bulk and solutions solution polymerization in last lecture .	2.975160564073948

We also talked about suspension polymerization , in last lecture we will let us start with suspension polymerization once again in this lecture .	3.732505088336674

Now , suspension polymerization as we talked about in last lecture that it is a heterogeneous polymerization , where you have monomer and monomer soluble initiator , and you have aqueous medium , and dispersions which actually absorbed on the monomer droplets .	4.285127975526612

And prevent them sterically to collide each other , and aqueous and make larger particles , and this dispersions are typically water soluble polymers like polyethylene , polyvinyl alcohols or polyaniline pyrrolidone and so on .	2.204955882638891

And it could be some inorganic particles as well which we which can absorb on the monomer particle size .	3.75089227288802

Now , depression a suspension polymers is similar to the bulk polymerization except that in this case , you have this tiny droplets which are dispersed in the aqueous medium , whereas in the bulk bulk polymerization , there was no such case .	3.5297962859694816

So , in this case as we discussed in the last lecture , what you do we actually dissolve the initiator in monomer , and then heat it to the required temperature , or the temperature we are planning to do the polymerization reaction .	3.174482352281792

Then the dispersion medium which is a aqueous solution with the with the dispersions or added and stirred vigorously .	3.5791408055625715

Now , vigorous stirring form this monomer droplets into small size , which is around this 100 to 500 microns and they are remain they remains stable , because they are surrounded or absorbed by the dispersion molecules .	2.744958614509515

So , they actually , this dispersion molecule prevent this droplets to collide each other , and form a large particles .	3.155094216626998

And this kinetics of suspension polymerization is same as the bulk polymerization , the advantage is because you have this aqueous medium present as diluents , so it is the heat dissipation which that heat which formed due to the polymerization reaction .	3.598124303173051

You can easily take out the heat , because of the dispersing medium , so no such problem in case of , as in the case of bulk polymerization .	4.251151498703028

And because the concentration in those monomer droplets , the concentration of monomer in those monomer droplets is high , similar to bulk polymerization , so the rate of polymerization as well as molecular weights is also high .	3.72275399598495

And polymers produced in this case are in the form of beads droplets , so you can simply at the end of the polymerization you can just separate out the beads by filtering process .	3.8003571800977376

And these beads should not stick to each other , if you are planning to filter the beads from the reaction medium , so it should be such that the beads should not stick to each other .	2.98729381164651

And it happens if the polymer you have synthesized or you have produced is rigid , so that and also there the temperature at which is below their glass transition temperature , so that they are not soft either , so basically they do not stick to each other .	3.304748356209381

So , these polymerization procedures are mainly for applied mainly for the polymers where glass transition temperature is well above the room temperature , room temperature like PMMA polymethylmethacrylate and so on .	2.5728302791557653

But not everything is good in this case , also there are disadvantages as well , now because you are planning to take out the polymerization at the end of the reaction in the form of beads , and take it to the application , the polymerization must complete .	3.6810553155943238

So , you should be able to take the polymerization till the equilibrium , it should be such a way that it should be able to complete the reaction as much as possible .	3.691582222423589

And auto acceleration , because it is a bulk polymerization auto acceleration will also happen , but that is not , in this case this is not that much problematic like the case of pure bulk polymerization .	4.4335053039502625

And if you do not want the polymers in bead shape , you want the polymer as such in a powder shape or shape whatever , and then because the polymers are formed in beads bead form , it is very sometimes it becomes very difficult , if you want to isolate the polymers in the form other than beads .	3.029751709242484

And of course this beads are absorbed , beginning they are absorbed with this dispersions like water soluble , polymer of the inorganic , particles we have to make sure you watch this beads thoroughly several times , to get rid of this dispersion .	2.419077761585323

But even though there could be possibilities of this dispersion remaining in the polymer beads as impurities , so these are the disadvantages .	4.029270050326717

And as I said these are used for the polymers that whose glass transition temperature is way above room temperature , like methylmethacrylate other acrylate esters , vinyl acetate , vinyl chloride , and so on .	2.804342738272593

Another type of heterogeneous polymerization is dispersion polymerization , in this case you have monomer dissolved in organic solvent , and the initiator is also dissolved in organic solvent and in this case also you have organic soluble dispersion .	3.782080937750928

Now , in this case the polymers which form they are in soluble in the solvent , so in absence of dispersion they would have precipitated from the solution .	3.7073801696422723

But because you have dispersion present in the medium , this polymer polymers will remain , they will the dispersion will get absorbed on the surface of this polymer , and the polymers should remain as dispersion in the polymerization medium .	3.7214244324818

Now , new monomers will get absorbed on to this polymer particles , and the polymerization will take place on that monomer , so polymer remains dispersed , because the present of dispersions .	2.827208112491612

And polymers grow in size as the absorbed monomers on this polymer molecules they get polymerized , and in this case the size of polymers are below of the size , what we achieved for a suspension polymers , say about 1 to 10 microns .	3.1062152055011802

Other is heterogeneous polymers like inversion suspension polymerization , is exactly the opposite inverse of suspension polymers , where the monomer is water soluble , and the dispersion medium is organic solvent .	2.9523379042671363

For example , acrylamide the polymerization in acrylamide in organic solvent , the other polymer type like microsuspension polymerization where the size of the beads are in much smaller micro domain , so the name microsuspension polymers are used .	2.8144263064483415

Now , in case in emulsion polymerization , you have apparently singular composition , monomer water has a medium , surfactants has a dispersions , but the only difference in this case is that in this case you have water soluble initiator .	3.1531315599452174

In this suspension case you have monomer soluble initiator ; you have water soluble initiator , now apparently its looks that this is small difference , but this has very far reaching implications in terms of the mechanism and the kinetics of the polymerization process in emulsion .	3.3933002860512613

So , research was still under way to understand the mechanism of the emulsion polymerization process .	3.7326498333204823

Now , the product of at the end of the polymerization , you get the product , the polymer product as dispersed particles not a bead not a large beads like suspension polymers , that there is a much smaller size about say 0.05 to 1 micron size , particles which are dispersed in a aqueous medium .	3.0037692843223915

Now , often this product of emulsion polymerization are termed as latex , and this latex can be directly used in several applications like paint , coatings and many other applications where you can directly take the you can directly take the polymer product at the end of the emulsion , and apply is as a as a painting or coatings .	2.6595162450007486

Of course , you have to have add the required pigment for or additives other additives for painting applications or so on , so as I said the size of the particles are much smaller than suspensions polymers , is about 0.05 to 1 micron .	3.041941950182455

And of course , the similar type of advantages are there as in the case of suspension polymers , the heat removal is not a problem , viscosity build up is also not a problem in this case .	3.491929462719622

One of the major advantages , one of the distinct advantage for emulsion polymerization which is highlighted here is that unlike other radical polymerization , for a fixed monomer concentration the molecular weight can be increased without compromising the polymerization rate .	3.226278991893315

We know from our discussion from last few lectures that , if you want to increase the polymerization rate either by increasing the temperature , or by increasing the initiator concentration what happen , polymerization rate goes up , but simultaneously the molecular weight comes down .	3.562000839046624

But , this is the case where keeping the monomer concentration fixed , you can increase the polymerization rate without compromising the molecular weight , or you can increase the molecular weight without compromising the compromising the polymerization .	4.418679422768888

Now , we will discuss more on the mechanistic part in a minute , and then we will understand this point , with little more clarity .	3.7709100418756463

And it are used for monomers at acetate , methylmethacrylate and other acrylate polymers , and it also applied for that copolymers like styrene , ABS and rubber and fluoronitated to the olefins .	2.3297612521637823

Now , this emulsion polymerization is of great industrial importance , in lot of industrial polymers are made by this process , and it started at the time of world war two .	2.859698151474332

When this first example of emulsion polymerization was done , which was emulsion polymerization was used to synthesize , used to synthesize a rubber , synthetic rubber or styrene and butadiene , which was first example of synthetic rubber .	2.507520116317687

And that was synthesized during the world war two by emulsion polymerization , and that that had a great importance in the outcome of the result of the war .	2.8457272978316266

So , of the process we discussed emulsion polymerization is of great importance industrially , you should remember that .	3.0562206908462315

Now , let us let us go back and look at the mechanism of the emulsion polymerization , now what are the constitutes , now say at the beginning what are the constitutions we have , we have monomers which is water insoluble or slightly soluble , very slightly soluble in water .	3.1826735628428513

Now , we have initiator which is water soluble , these are typically thus the per sulfate potassium or sodium per sulfate or redox initiators we talked about , when you talked about different types of initiators .	2.7654519152407895

And we have surfactant , now surfactants act as a dispersant stabilizer of the large monomer droplets will come to that , and it also act as a solubilizer of the monomers molecules in it is core .	3.203980259849698

And it is also called emulsifier , because it is responsible for emulsifying the medium , so it is also calls emulsifier , and it is used at quite high concentration , if we remember the concentration of the dispersant in suspension polymers , it was around 0.01 weight percent .	3.2146816076884797

But in this case it is much higher , so 0.1 to 3 weight percent and of course , this concentration are quite high , and it is far greater than the critical micelle aggregation critical micelle aggregation concentration , CMC of the surfactant .	3.2897357470079904

So , most of the surfactant molecules present at in this water medium as micelles , as you can appreciate that , because the surfactant concentration is quite high and CMC of the surfactants are quite low .	3.2879759150379613

So , the most of the surfactant molecules are present as or present in , micelles , and micelles if you are not aware micelles are aggregation of surfactants which because it has surfactant has about hydrophobic and hydrophilic components by forming micelles .	2.654736855532362

This molecule can hide the hydrophobic parts from aqueous environment , and they form aggregates , and typically this aggregate are of size of 2 to 10 nanometer .	2.465824484350384

And they have aggregation numbers which means the number of surfactants per micelle is around 50 to 150 , this numbers depends on the different kinds of surfactants .	3.669844791682171

Now , generally anionic surfactants are used for emulsion polymerization , and typically these are salts of fatty acids , salt of salts of fatty acids , like sodium or potassium salts of palmitic or stearate or laurateo or it has sulfates like sodium lauryl sulphates or sodium dodecyl sulfate or sulfonate , like sodium benzene , benzene sulfonate .	1.951818321225231

So , these are typical anionic surfactant used in this emulsion polymerization process , and typical concentration of are the ratio of water is to monomer is taken as say about 70 30 to 60 40 by weight .	2.820007314765302

Now , of course if you require the control of molecular weight chain transfer , agent , origins can be added if you require or as required by the scientist ; so you know what are the ingredients are there in a emulsion polymerization system .	3.0527752099302017

Now , let us see what happens at the beginning at the beginning t is equal to 0 , you have water with initiator , so I let us draw something like this , so this is a inside is a water medium , so you have initiator molecules dissolved in the water molecule , when you add surfactants , surfactants will form micelles .	3.3413897797158647

Now , I am just drawing this cartoons , they could mean they will be many micelles , so let us let me draw through here , now I am drawing a spherical micelle that does not mean that all the micelles or spherical or all the time micelles are spherical .	2.7244065437198173

Micelles are this surfactant aggregates can be other types as well depending up on the concentration of the surfactant , or the or the composition of the aqueous medium , whether there are salt present or not , it could be cylindrical or lamellar or other aggregates can be possible .	2.9433832485333746

Now , if you add monomer , now obviously there will be slight solubility , very slight solubility , so you have I write M for the monomer , so you have few monomer molecules , very small amount of monomer I write M , they are dissolved in water .	3.0576911519083505

A small amount of monomer are are will be present or will be solubilized in the surfactant core , because we know that surfactant cores are hydrophobic in nature , which means they can this like core ; so they can solubilize any non polar or hydrophobic molecules inside .	2.5979893263680456

So , when you add monomers there are very small fractions of monomer present in a soluble , in a water medium , is very a small fraction of present as as a soluble inside the surfactant micelle .	3.1672899711571048

And a large amount of monomer present as monomers droplets which are stabilized by the surfactant , so let me tell you one more time that at beginning we dissolved the initiator in the water , and then when we add the surfactants surfactant form micelles , many micelles ; and there will be some surfactant as a free molecules in the water medium .	2.9662253751673147

Now , let me tell you few numbers , the concentration of surfactant micelle say micelle and around 10 to the power 19 to 10 to the power 21 liter inverse , so per liter of this you have this many micelles .	3.008227541308254

And concentration of monomer droplets droplets , they are of the order of 10 to the power 12 to 10 to the power of 14 liter inverse , now they are all this monomer droplet are stabilized , again by absorption of the surfactants .	2.745580638980437

Now , the this the solubility of the monomer or the partition of the monomer outside micelle , and in the aqueous medium would depend on the solubility of the monomer in aqueous solution .	4.3596734794720735

For example , if you consider three monomers like styrene , butadiene , and methylmethacrylate , the solubility in water of these free monomers are gram per liter , butadiene 0.8 gram per liter , whereas MMA is 16 gram per liter .	2.34348861377994

Obviously , the less the soluble , the monomer is in the aqueous medium they will try to partition more inside the micelles .	4.08651304979886

So , the factor , the amount of monomer inside the micelle by the amount of monomer outside the micelle in aqueous solution are of this order 40 , 5 and 2 this numbers is the ratio of the amount of monomer inside the micelle , and outside , outside means as a dissolved monomer .	2.7960465832031915

Obviously , styrene has a minimum solubility in the water , so they will it will partition more inside the micelles , so it has the amount of monomer inside the micelles much more compared to MMA which has a higher solubility in water .	3.0365366805709657

So , as I said 95 percent , more than 95 percent of the monomer present as large droplets , now large droplet size , this droplet size is about say 1 to 100 micron which has quite large compared to the sizes of the surfactant micelle .	3.1032231414809273

So , if you will compare this number and the size , then total surface area total surface area of the micelles which will be much greater than the total surface area of the monomer droplets .	3.9373549873241793

So , this is the situation , I hope you are clear what at the beginning of the emulsion polymerization , now you start a polymerization that mean initiator is forming say radical .	2.9293167180117052

Now , what happened if initiator forms radical , initiator is forming radical , now this radical will react with the monomer present in the aqueous medium and form .	3.8920737943460373

Because , the concentration of this monomers is quite low , so they can only form oligomeric species , and also this oligomeric species oligomeric species or oligomeric radical , propagating radical they are also not soluble in water .	3.3400121525826845

So , they will try to find a place to go , are you clear I is forming giving rise to initiator radical say R dot , now R dot will react with M the concentration of M is very small , so R dot will react with M and form oligomeric propagating radical .	2.91486574803283

Now , because M itself is very insoluble , you know slightly soluble in water , so obviously the oligomeric radical will be even more insoluble in water .	2.628180920274272

So , it will try to find space to go , now it can go inside micelle or it can go the monomer droplets , because that is the place where you have hydrophobic environment .	3.8464909697411254

Now , because the surface area of the micelles are much more , it is always 99 percent plus or even more , time radical or a primary radical or a propagating radical , oligomeric propagating radical will move into a surfactant micelle containing the monomer molecules ; rather than moving into a monomer droplets .	2.9643270310393763

Now , that is very important concept and here the primary radical or the propagating radical , they will move into the micelle core , and start the reaction immediately the polymerization reaction , rather than entering this monomer droplets .	3.217840494944698

Most of the polymerization happens inside this surfactant micelles , now what happened once the polymer on the propagating radical or the primary radical gets into this micellar core , they will start the polymerization reaction .	3.154262220089845

Now , once they start the polymers reaction , the monomer concentration will be lower because monomer is getting converted into polymer .	3.8593285829900625

So , monomer will be supplied from the bulk via or monomer will be supplied again inside the micellar core and to maintain the equilibrium , this monomer droplet will supply the monomer in the solution , are you clear .	2.8478575335653944

Polymerization happening inside the miceller core , monomer concentration get depleted , so the monomers inside the micelle , this monomer droplets will become smaller by supplying micelle , supplying monomer to the miceller core via , this aqueous medium .	2.1665950702204424

Now , you cannot call this as a surfactant micelle in more is basically , now you can have to name polymer particle plus free monomer stabilized by absorption of surfactant , you got it .	3.012780351037848

So , more and more of this will generate and to stabilize this , you require more and more surfactant , the number of surfactant which was originally present ; in the micelle they are not sufficient to stabilize this .	3.667402283996794

Where from they will get they will get this surfactant micelle , they will get this surfactant , there are other micelle where the polymerization is not started , when you start this polymerization this radical will not go in all the micelle containing monomer .	3.1699084040158736

Because , this number is much higher compared to the number of primary radicals , for example the radical concentration typically at the beginning is R dot , beginning is 10 to the power 16 liter inverse , whereas we know that concentration of micelle around 10 to power 21 ; so it is basically 10 to the power of 5 times number of micelles .	3.6778614107600323

So , what happen that the radical will go in small number of micelles which will grow , and form particles surrounded by the surfactant .	3.2725644005461985

Now , as this particles form more and more , the this requires more and more surfactant molecules to get stabilized , which will be supplied by the micelle , which are not taking part in polymerization reaction or the inactive micelles .	3.2894565842503103

This is the micelles where polymerization is taking place we call them active micelles , and the micelles where polymerization is not taking place we call inactive micelle .	2.7885276533454397

So , inactive micelles will slowly break releasing the monomer in the solution , and the they will supply the surfactant through the growing polymer particles .	2.9791088621010577

So , what happened soon as situation will come where the all the surfactant actually consumed , and you have a fixed number of particles which are active , where the polymerization is going on .	3.4796492249123174

The rate or conversion goes up to a certain one point , where all the micelle are all the the inactive micelles they are broken down realizing all the surfactant .	2.7002147154900085

So , every surfactant , every micelle which are present , they all active micelle or they have already turned into the polymer particle surrounded by the surfactant molecules .	2.6185125398249713

So , that is this happens within 2 to 10 percent of conversion , and we call this part as a stage I , so if you plot the rate of the polymer , polymerization rate with time as more and more and more this active micelles or the more and more micelles take part in the polymerization rate goes up .	3.683317380963029

At the end of this stage I , the surfactant are consumed , so you have fixed number of particles , particles I mean polymer particles plus free monomer surround by the surfactant molecules , so they have now fixed in number .	2.632699302838362

So , no more increase in the number of particles , hence no more increase in the rate of polymerization , so that is the end of stage II a stage I .	4.913546405575246

Now , what happened stage II , now you have what you have now , you have large monomer droplets still present of course , the size is sunk from the beginning and you have the initiator molecules , and you have such particles , particles means monomer plus polymer surrounded by the surfactant molecules , that is a stage at the end of the stage I .	3.309224984235547

And you have polymer particles , which are polymer particles plus free monomers surrounded by or stabilized by the absorption of the surfactant molecules , this has formed by the polymerization in the surfactant micelles , there are no free micelle in this time .	2.8578633609911943

Now , what happened here as more and more reaction happen , the monomer concentration get depleted , so to supply more monomers this size of this , monomer droplets comes down , and it is supplied to this reacting polymer particles .	3.3035652118397465

And because the monomer concentration inside these particle are almost remain constant , so the polymerization rate remain almost constant , throughout this stage II .	3.074438775883909

So , what happen in this stage II , what is happing in stage II one more time , monomer is getting into as the polymerization progress , monomer is getting depleted and that is relinquished by the supply of monomer from this droplet via the aqueous medium .	2.510439772094045

So , what happen now , now this will continue the reaction till you have the monomer present in this reaction , so the monomer concentration inside this polymerization reactor comes down .	3.7498191917248174

So , you I hope you understand all this stage I , stage II , and stage III , one more time stage I is completed when all this inactive size surfactant micelles gets broken , into for supplying surfactants to the active micelles .	2.2100249161727885

Stage II , at the end of stage II all the monomer droplets disappeared , because the monomer has been supplied to the reacting polymer particle , surrounded by the surfactant molecules , and stage III is basically the completion of the polymerization reaction inside those reacting , or active polymer particles .	2.8486674367782765

Now , if we want to look at the kinetics part for this emulsion process , let us call define n bar which is the average number of radicals in a single particle , there are many such particles .	3.3751803880814197

So , average number of moles of radical in a single particle is n bar by N A , N A is the abogados number .	4.001585216331758

So , the rate of polymerization inside one particle , one polymer particle is given by we know the expression , K p M p where this is the monomer concentration inside one particle , and the radical concentration which is given by this that is from our knowledge .	4.004815983763958

Now , this polymerization continue till second radical gets into this reactor , because the size is very small , so if the second radical gets in the effective radical concentration goes high , so the immediately the bimolecular termination reaction happen .	2.6573169221286266

So , at any point of time it could be 1 radical or it could be 0 radical , it can ever have more than 1 radical , because as soon as the second radical gets into the this medium or this polymer particle , they will the 2 radicals will terminate will do the bimolecular reaction and terminate .	2.831635989317871

Now , because the radical are entering into this micelles or the particles randomly , the probability that at any point of time the probability that any point of time a particle have a 1 or 0 radical is same , you understand that can it can have either 1 radical or a 0 radical , it cannot have more than 1 radical .	2.6780978847141057

And that is because the this radicals are entering into this micelles or the polymer particles randomly , the probability that you will find at any point of time , the chances or the probability of finding at any point of time 1 radical or 0 radical is same .	2.863459466043362

That means the average number of radicals in 1 particle is half , because the probability of finding 1 radical and no radical is same , so probability of finding 1 radical is or the average number of radical is half .	3.00206077664346

So , n bar is half , so we can write M p by twice N A , now you have , if you have N p is a number of such particles , then total this is the total reaction rate will given the by the rates in individual particle multiplied by the total number of particles .	3.893948777757091

So , that is the rate of polymerization , and this can be increased by increasing N p which is the number of such particle , which is taking part in the reaction , that can be increased by increasing the surfactant concentration or by increasing the number of micelles .	4.310432687961762

If you increase the number of micelles , then it is likely that number of micelles is taking part in polymerization is more compared to a situation , we you have less number of micelle .	3.5925230410045916

So if we increase the number of micelles by increasing the surfactant concentration , you will increase a N p , and then you will increase the rate of polymerization , what is the molecular weight .	4.477878460279598

Now , kinetic chain length in this case is same as degrees of polymerization , we talked about this before that , if you have two kinetic chain , and if they are if they are terminating by a combination reaction , then the molecular weights double .	4.963986987948477

Then the length of the kinetic chain or if they are doing a termination by this propagation , then they are the X n is same as the kinetic chain length .	5.040489268041391

But in this case , because the how does it terminate termination happens , it happens as soon as the second one gets in , so if you have a polymer particle of this size which was undergoing the propagation , now you have some second radical comes in and they will undergo immediately termination reaction .	2.8433549044319713

Now , this size , the size of this radicals or size of this oligomeric propagating radical is much smaller , very oligomeric in nature , so whether they terminate by this propagation or they terminate by a combination , the size of the final dead chain is same as a size of this kinetic chain length .	3.316569113687714

You can ignore or this size of size contribution due to this entering propagating radical is insignificant , so we can write chain degrees of polymerization that is in , and the polymerization is forming in a particle .	3.641879506887388

So , we can write the rate of polymerization by rate of initiation in a particle , so r p we know we have just now deduced , this is M p by 2 A N A that is r p .	3.227562307833227

Now , r i is what , is given by N p by R I , where R i is the total initiation rate , total number of initiator is generating and N p is the number of particle where they are going , so for one particle the initiation would be given by R i by N p .	3.6602528702594466

So , R i which is initiation rate for single particle will be total of initiator rate by the number of particles , so I just putting this R i here to get this , so you get the molecular weight as this .	3.121673528063

So , if you fix or if you do not change the initiation reaction , the molecular weight again goes up with N p , so with single handle by just increasing N p , you can now increase the molecular weight of the polymer .	3.4639994469066324

And at the same time you can increase the polymerization rate , which is not happened in earlier case , where if you increase the initiation rate the polymer molecular weight comes down at the same , where the polymerization rate goes up .	4.162800923424084

So , this is one very advantages advantage of your emulsion polymerization where N p as N p goes up , which you can achieve by increasing the surfactant concentration and increasing the number of micelle .	3.172632291913393

Or miceller concentration with both the R p rate of polymerization goes up ; as well as the number average degrees of polymerization .	3.8403297392665134

Now , at any point of time you can find out the size of this emulsion polymer , the particles like miceller particles or the droplets by help of this electron microscopic or light scattering or inter centrifugation .	2.841768576242896

If you want to prove in a reaction , if you promote the reaction , you know find out what is the size of this your polymer particles or so on , so I hope you understood this emulsion polymerization part .	3.2295405314947683

And what we will do we will next move to the discussion on living radical polymerization , now we by this time we know that molecular weight in a normal polymerization , radical polymerization comes down .	3.60517407433352

In a steady state the molecular weight comes down as time goes , sorry it is the other way round , molecular goes up and as time progresses or time increases .	3.839297289665883

I am talking about steady state , because most of the time reaction happens in a steady state , if gel effect or other complication happen , then the situation is more complicated to simply conclude .	2.834968163293012

So , the polymers form at the beginning will have low molecular weight , whereas if you increase or when the polymers is producing later on during the reaction , the size increases that we have we have rationalized .	3.9305314562367077

It also true for normal radical polymerization that that the polymers are dead , which means that you , once the polymerization is complete you cannot take this polymers and add the second monomer to make a black copolymer , or something like rather that .	3.3239877202735433

So , if you design a mechanism by which you can start all the polymers together , so if you design , can design a mechanism or you can start all the polymer together , and let all this polymer all this polymers undergo polymerization or propagation for same duration .	3.247332968193198

For you have you have initiator lot of polymers together , all the polymers together and you have continuing all this polymers all this polymers is undergoing polymer propagation reaction , this during the same duration .	2.8996006212226586

Now , that is the only possible , if this polymers are live that means they do not undergo this bimolecular termination reaction , if they undergo bimolecular termination reaction they will be dead immediately , and they will not be able to continue the propagation chain .	3.772596643415275

So , what we will do and if they are live , they will remain live at the end of the polymerization as well , if they can live all this time , which is quite a longer time compared to a termination reaction .	3.2603440686827874

Then there is no reason why they will be dead at the end of the polymerization , so they will be still be live at the end of the polymerization , so you can use this and make the block copolymers .	4.022531751472482

So , what we will do in the next lecture , we will talk about the strategies by which we can achieve this situation this situations , so that we can make all the polymer chains of similar size , because they are started from same time , and continue it for same time .	2.988520925586438

So , all the polymers should be of similar size the will be lower , and they will be live all the time , so say the at the end of the polymerization , they will also be live .	3.9094108625050064

So , we will see what are the strategies we can take to make such a requirement fulfilled , so we will talk we will start from this slide in the next lecture .	3.559957372307526

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

Before I start this subject , just recap the subject matter what we discussed in the last two lectures .	3.377449074037625

We talked about gel effect and we also talked about the effect of glass - transition temperature on the resulting polymer , effect of glass transition temperature of the resulting polymer on polymerization process .	4.248633636193976

Now , let us start what is the effect of temperature on the polymer , polymerization rate and the resulting molecular weight .	4.561264784266081

Now , first let us consider , consider the case of thermal initiation .	7.203517507050704

We know that in case of thermal polymerization R p is given by k p M f k d I k t half .	3.791036028784267

You also know that X n bar , the number average degrees of polymerization is given by expression , we have deduced this expression in earlier lectures , so you should be knowing this very well , where b is the average number of initiator residues per polymer molecules .	3.2206610421971025

Now , from this reaction , if you look at the equation little carefully you can find out , that if the monomer concentration increases both R p and the number average degrees of polymerization increases , which is the molecular weight .	4.436368530581338

If the initiator concentration increases , then R p goes up , rate of polymerization goes up , but X n bar or the molecular weight comes down .	3.7215957677925604

So , what is the effect of temperature on R p and X n is we are going to discuss now .	4.316652264858978

Now , the same expression R p , I can divide into two terms , one is temperature dependent and another is temperature independent .	3.0215736919842904

So , if you look at the temperature independent term and put in the left hand side , I can put concentration M f to the power half and I to the power half .	3.04147366289708

Now , this part is temperature independent , whereas the other term , the rate constant k p k d to the power half and k t to the power half , these are all rate constant values .	3.4857841225524044

So , definitely , they will depend on the temperature of the reaction you were using .	5.199304033496717

Similarly , you can break down this number of degrees of polymerization , number , average degrees of polymerization into two terms , one is temperature independent , I can break into two terms , this is temperature independent and the other term , k d k t to the power half , so these are temperature dependent .	3.022943031737707

Now , you also know from basic physical chemistry knowledge , that rate constant can be expressed in form of Arrhenius - type equation expression where you can write rate constant is A e to the power minus E by RT , where k is rate constant , A is the frequency factor , frequency collation factor , E is the activation energy for the reaction .	3.0927463696635207

This is well known to you guys , so you know that .	4.855817597345942

So , we can express all the three rate constants , k p , k t and k d in terms of Arrhenius equation e to the power minus E p where E p is the activation energy for propagation .	3.509662990723445

Similarly , k d is A p e to power minus E d and k t is A t e to power minus E t ; E t is the activation energy for termination reaction .	3.159600406956712

Now , in this , in this expression , this is the expression for rate of propagation and now we know , that the monomer is consumed both , in initiation process and in the propagation process , but because the monomer consumed in the initiation process is very insignificant compared to propagation process , rate of polymerization is equivalent to rate of propagation .	4.0176045983565

So , I can take this expression and write this k terms in terms of the Arrhenius equation or else , we can simply write , ln R p from that earlier expression , M f to the power half I to the power half plus ln A p A d to the power , this is A d , to the power half A t to power half minus E p half E d minus half E t by RT .	2.612779386753538

We can write all this from this Arrhenius - type expression and this is , this term E p plus half E d minus half E t , we are writing as the entropy of the polymerization reaction .	3.419871698330609

So , depending upon the sign of this activation energy , the rate will depend on the temperature .	4.810890696368494

We can just simply write d ln R p by dT is plus E R by RT square .	2.9206069431303883

If you differentiate it , you find out the rate with respect to the temperature .	4.46468323195631

now , we can , before we talk about the value of E R we can similarly write from the expression of X n .	4.86067069304542

So , d ln X n , which gives you the rate of change of molecule , degrees of , average degrees of number , average degrees of polymerization as similarly E X n by RT square , where E X n is E p minus half E d minus half E t .	3.3085005674876653

Now , what is the value of E R and E X n ?	4.732622957129767

Now , this will come from the individual values of E p , E d and E t .	3.2679579099425875

Now , as we know the rate constant or rate of the reaction is much faster , for termination is the highest rate and then propagation and then initiation , we can simply write from or that knowledge , that E t is , should be greater than activation energy of , this must be greater than E p because this is the most , this is the fastest reaction and this is also fast reaction where the initiation is a slower reaction .	3.512781564797258

So , you expect that activation energy for the initiation reaction should be higher than the other two .	4.872047177901214

Now , what are the typical values of this E d and E t ?	3.9684531961660405

Typical values of E d for thermal initiation process come about 120 to 150 kilo joule per mol , E p comes on 20 to 40 kilo joule per mol and E t is 2 to 20 kilo joule per mol , these are the experimental values .	2.911459594826341

Now , that gives you the value for E R , around 80 to 90 kilo joule per mol inverse .	4.451433048136229

If you plot the rate of polymerization , which is 1 by T , it will be coming down linearly .	4.934611513671666

Now , this value indicates that for every 10 degree rise , there is around two to three fold , two to three times increase in the rate of polymerization .	2.767693946483236

So , if T goes up , R p goes up and every decade , every 10 degree centigrade it will be around 2 to 3 times from the original value .	3.0072599389225045

Now , if you calculate the number for E X n , you get around 60 , minus 60 kilo joule per mol inverse , mol inverse , per mol , which means , that degrees of , average degrees of polymerization or the molecular rate , will , will come down as we increase the temperature .	2.977543773799202

So , if you plot with 1 over T , this is the curve for R p and this will be curve for your X n , X n bar .	3.750730945183104

So , this is clear to you , that from the experimental values of these activation energies you can justify , that if the temperature goes up , the rate of the polymerization will go up and similar time the molecular weight or the number average degrees of polymerization will come down .	3.7237907400390844

Now , you can justify these in , this way , that once you increase the temperature , the more and more radical gets generated for a given time , like more and more radical gets generated , then more and more polymer forms for a given time .	3.339663834346031

When more polymer forms , rate of polymers increases , and because the radical concentration increases , increased with temperature , the termination reaction also increase .	3.406275119624325

So , as the more termination is reaction is going on , the average length of the polymer chains also comes down .	4.101355031109747

You can justify this drop in molecular weight with increase in temperature and increasing rate of polymerization .	3.5489817494823774

With increase in temperature by just thinking , that with increase you get more number of radical generated in the polymerization medium for a given time .	3.7386307425872074

Now , if we talked about the other initiation process .	6.117903728034649

This was for thermal initiation processes .	6.516456507256366

Now , if we talk about the other initiation process , like redox , number two is redox initiation .	3.1520137603202945

And again , you can break down this expression in the two terms , one temperature independent and another temperature dependent .	3.9072225048973594

Temperature dependent on terms of the rate constant k p , k d and k t and same , as you can do this and do the same exercise what we did for the thermal initiation and see what is the value of E R in this case .	4.125581321390583

E R in this case means , for redox initiation , again we will be coming around 40 kilo joule per mol .	3.9134015225599135

Thus , because the E d for this reaction , for this initiation process is much lower compared to a thermal initiation process , that we , while discussion in the initiation , the types of initiation process we mentioned , that redox reaction , you can do it at lower temperature , that is because the activation energy for the initiation reaction is much lower compared to thermal initiator .	3.623685551920688

Now , that gives , if you use the same thing you will find , that E R is coming around , whereas the values for k p and k t remains same means , the values for E t and E p remains same as the thermal initiation because they are the same reactions we are talking about .	3.529840957545865

So , if you put all these numbers you will get , that e , E R coming around 40 kilo joule per mol .	2.8584945874688414

So , in this case also , the R p goes up as temperature goes up , but it is not as , as much increase as in the case of thermal initiation process .	4.194945617524415

Now , what is E X n 0 ?	5.838222433017534

If you again put this number you will find , that E X n 0 is about 0 kilo joule per mol , which suggest , that there is no effect , no effect of temperature on molecular weight for a redox initiated radical polymerization , redox initiator radical polymerization .	3.0118212325621343

So , what for this type of initiation ?	7.281742494185922

We know , we found , that temperature increases , rate of polymerization also increases .	4.986687554533798

Further increase is not as much as in case of thermal polymerization and because the activation energy for the molecular build up is about 0 , which means , there is no effect of the temperature on the molecular weight of redox polymerization , that is why , the redox polymerization are done at room temperature or even sub - roomed temperature because temperature increase would not affect , have no effect on the radical polymerization .	3.3111636540673923

Now , we know again from , of , it gives you phi I a k t to the power half .	2.8286859538230695

This is I a , I a is the intensity of light , phi is the yield .	4.088955561997813

You do not see k d term because k d is for thermal initiation process , is actually E d is 0 , sorry , this photo chemical reaction process E d is 0 and the other E p and E t remains same .	3.0938719094818596

So , if you put E d is 0 and E t , E t term values from same as earlier , you will get E r is 20 kilo joule per mol .	2.8027060435544002

So , as E X n , which means , that in case of radical polymerization initiated by a photo chemical reaction , again the reaction rate , rate of polymerization increases mildly , in this case with increase in temperature and so does the molecular weight .	4.258649223673408

Here also , molecular weight increases slightly with increase in the temperature .	5.242281269253194

So , if you increase , there will be complications of the , which type of initiation is dominating and so this equation will be combination of photochemical reaction and a .	2.985382912489921

This will be little complicated , but for , simply we can do it at lower temperature , then that thermal decision does not come , does not play effect .	2.9123530331721095

Then these conclusions will be varied , will be varied , that rate of reaction or rate of polymerization slightly increases with increase in temperature and the degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight also increases with increases in the temperature slightly .	3.6668185757320955

Now , remember , we , we got this expression for rate of polymerization , this and in case of thermal initiation as well , this , this expression , this expression we got assuming , that the reaction is at steady state .	4.464067780467793

We , we applied the steady state approximation to , to find out the concentration of the radical , total radical present .	4.309129896175914

So , these conclusions we just made the , about the effect of temperature on reaction rate and molecular weight is valid till the steady state is maintained .	3.4592806847680815

Once the steady state is broken , for example , this gel effect , during the gel effect when steady state is broken , then this is not valid , this conclusions is not , are not valid anymore and you know , though the effect of temperature will remain in much more complicated than what we just discussed .	2.9419695471958316

So , we , we also did not consider , that there could be possibility of transfer reaction .	4.2175988776419135

Now , from Mayo equation we have seen how the molecular weight varies with the chain transfer of the polymers where we can write… This is , we have in the last class or the lecture before last one , we had seen , that if there is a chain transfer , then the molecular weight actually drops as the result of chain transfer reaction and this is , this 0 is , this X n bar is the number average degrees of polymerization in absence of any chain transfer reaction .	4.386318154742534

So , if there is any chain transfer reaction , the actual value of X n bar will come down and C s and other C s , it could be A s , could be a monomer a solvent or a molecule , which are added from outside by deliberately or by , it present as impurities .	3.2179279256498017

And this is , this is , this R stand for transfer constant and are given by the rate constant for the transfer and rate constant for the propagation .	4.389986751440975

So , we can again write same another equation and write ln C s as similar to the earlier cases .	3.010978864023885

Now , generally , E , activation energy for transfer is higher than the activation energy for the propagation , which means , with , with increase in temperature C s goes up , the value of C s goes up .	3.8083443288157266

From this expression you can see , you can write the other , similar to other expressions as well , which gives you E transfer s minus E p by RT square from this expression .	3.2326676559913317

You can clearly see , that with increase in temperature , here temperature goes up , this values of transfer coefficient , transfer constant goes up and if this transfer constant goes up , that means , what will happen ?	3.3480771338091264

Molecular weight , molecular weight will further come down .	5.5203532667717905

So , we have , we have seen how you can get quantitatively the average number , average degrees of polymerization in presence of chain transfer reaction and from this expression we have seen , that if we increase the concentration of chain transfer agents the molecular weight goes down .	5.107136342638381

And if the chain transfer or transfer constant goes up , then also the molecular weight comes down compared to the case where there is no transfer .	5.094754006121984

Now , C s value , as we seen from the activation energy for transfer reaction and the propagation reaction , that if temperature goes up , C s goes up , which means , X n come down .	3.3189447187213545

So , increase in temperature has to affect increase in temperature by itself even if there was no transfer reaction .	3.735827605654013

It was decreasing the molecular weight and in places of transfer reaction is further reducing .	4.873311142353361

So , if you have a transfer reaction going on , then the increase in temperature will affect more , it will decrease the molecular weight more in comparison where there is no transfer reaction going on .	3.559295042307021

Both the cases , the molecular weight drop , with , with increase in temperature , but if there are transfer reaction going on , then the drop will be much more compared to situation where is , when there is no transfer reaction .	3.694625868292353

Now , that basically says , now what the effect of temperature on rate of polymerization and , and molecular weight for different radical processes means , different radical processes is initiated by different initiation reaction as and also , in case of the radical reaction where you have chain transfer reactions .	3.5770390527689506

Now , let us talk about thermodynamics of , of radical polymerization .	3.776376170456652

In fact , this is true for any chain growth polymerizations , so we can generalize this chain growth polymerization .	3.1683729517801966

Now , we have just concluded , that if T goes up , R p goes up , we just concluded in our discussion few minutes back .	2.668846349138534

It does not mean , that if you increase , keep on increasing the temperature , rate always will go up .	4.2933114145649345

The answer is no because in this case , we have only considered the forward reaction , we are talking about propagation reaction , whereas there could be backward reaction , depropagation reaction as well .	3.3155628834319133

This is k p and this is k dp , depropagation reaction .	6.346647668450403

Now , we do not consider normally the reverse reaction because the temperature , we do for most of the monomers , the reverse reaction is almost nil , that is why , we always talk about rate of forward reactions .	3.480883243354531

So , actually the rate of , so net rate of polymerization would be rate of , polymers , propagation minus rate of depropagation .	4.150721250747246

Now , as I said , that in normal case , whatever temperature we use for most of the polymers , this is 0 .	3.986428190014843

We consider rate of polymerization as the rate of propagation altogether .	7.332094209605621

And if we increase the temperature further , rate of depolymerization also increases , so as rate of polymerization , as we discussed just now .	3.8655028252917965

So , at some temperature , some temperature T , which we call T c , ceiling temperature , ceiling temperature , this R p becomes R dp .	2.4621505997783473

So , basically this propagation and depropagation reaction , they reach in equilibrium .	3.178318932563523

So , rate of polymerization reaction , propagation reaction is same as rate of depropagation reaction , if I want to show this in , in a figure , what we can , so if this is your rate .	3.9518734940266538

And if this temperature , rate of polymerization or rate of propagation increases with temperature .	5.292525664256265

Now , at some point of time , some point temperature , rate of depropagation also , this is dp and this is p , is a propagation and this is depropagation also increases .	3.6958961579039378

Now , that point , so net , so net reaction , net polymerization reaction , which is R p net , how it will act , it will look like ?	2.838119634925396

It will be something like this because below this temperature the rate of polymerization is higher and then the depolymerization becomes significant and at this temperature , which is , t ’ s , T c , the net polymerization is 0 .	3.5365606634084767

That means , if you do not see any change in the concentration of monomer , which means , that no polymerization is taking place .	4.525037515390418

If you comeback after some time and take the , these are the concentration of the monomer and you see , that the monomer concentration is same as before , which means , that monomer is not , monomer is not participating in further polymerization reaction .	4.126086856177455

So , that is the time when the quick decision is reached .	4.25336587115833

Now , let us prove this phenomenal little more .	3.483404092609494

At T c you have R , R p is same as R d p now r p you know k p M and M dot and this will be M dot .	3.7771046382319313

Equilibrium constant k is k p by k dp is 1 by M at equilibrium now at i write e because this is an equilibrium .	3.2808404521209993

So , I write , substitute e for these all this concentration .	3.526997958968996

So , at , equilibrium constant is related to the concentration of the monomer in this case only .	6.354444885127188

Now , this is a special case where you do not see the concentration of product is appearing in your equilibrium constant , it is only the reactants .	4.491458941670142

In this case , the monomer , which is appearing in the , your equilibrium constant value .	4.324160768490163

Now , I can write few thermodynamic expressions .	5.693338584199425

We know del G 0 standard gives energy change for polymerization R T c ln k , where k is the equilibrium constant .	3.203584520462538

We can write from this R T c ln M e and we can write , del G 0 p as del H 0 p minus T c del S 0 p this side ; right side R T c ln M e .	2.77897968776159

This as you know , this , this is the standard enthalpy of polymerization reaction and this is standard entropy of the polymerization and this is standard state for monomer is considered .	5.071243108710191

Standards state for monomers is either pure monomer , pure monomer or 1 molar solution of monomer , whereas for polymer , it is pure amorphous polymer , pure amorphous polymer or slightly crystalline polymer , or , or 1 molar solution of polymer repeat units .	2.527707140532225

So , what does del H and del S 0 means ?	4.170555525556852

That you take a pure monomer and convert to pure polymer associated enthalpy , chain , change will give you delta S 0 or you take one molar solution of the monomer and convert it completely into polymer .	3.1684309616234576

Now , the associated enthalpy chains will give you del H 0 and the entropy change will give you the del S 0 of the polymer .	3.723715375251012

Now , relook at this expression and we can , this expression and let us write from this expression , thus ln M e is del H 0 p by R T c minus del S 0 p by R .	4.296350321855202

Similarly , we can write , T c is del H 0 p by del S 0 p plus R ln M e .	3.9957058056800934

Now , what does these two expressions says , that T c and M e are related , they are not independent to each other .	3.150309060985269

If you change T c , if you increase T c , the equilibrium constant , concentration of the free monomer increases and so as the other thing , M e increases , equilibrium constant , concentration of the monomer increases , then T c also increases .	3.402950501968602

This is a very important thing , that T c is not a single temperature , it , it depends on the composition of your polymerization reaction .	4.39225509591113

It is not that every polymer has or every monomer has a single ceiling temperature .	3.1961619895838194

This and this often is understood , that T c is the single number , it actually depends on the monomer concentration as well .	3.877760033729312

Now , how to , how to sort of read these equations ?	3.730037691022601

Let us understand , every , if you can , you can consider every temperature , you can consider every temperature as , you can consider whatever reaction you are doing as a ceiling temperature .	3.7313952857400956

If you start a reaction , if you start or if at any point of time in a reaction , if M concentration is or the monomer is higher than equilibrium value , then the reaction will proceed till M becomes M e , then reaction will not take place further ; that means , rate of propagation will be same as depropagation .	3.3508118155700437

So , every temperature , there is associated , for every temperature there is a ceiling temperature , there is associated equilibrium monomer concentration .	3.320552642556096

The reaction will continue , propagation will continue till your free monomer concentration becomes as the equilibrium free monomer concentration .	3.326504770146658

At any point , I say , you start a reaction with your free monomer concentration less than M e , then will what will happen ?	3.227760268918564

You fix a temperature for your reaction and you start with a monomer concentration , which is lower than your equilibrium monomer concentration , which means , the reaction will not go .	4.574203287264111

Rather , if the polymer chain can be initiated , polymer chains can be broken at some , some place and you get a radical or some active center , the polymers will depropagate , unzip to form monomers , so that the free monomer concentration goes up and gives you the equilibrium monomer concentration .	3.769060937278772

And if your , at any point of time if your monomer concentration is equivalent to your equilibrium monomer concentrate , then the reaction will stop , that means , that there will be no appreciable or there is no change in the concentration of the free monomers .	3.340763092189457

So , apparently , there is no reaction going on .	6.805061722677985

Actually , there is a rate of propagation is same as rate of depropagation .	6.357648267468488

Now , that temperature corresponds to an equilibrium value of the free monomer determined by the values of del H 0 and del S 0 .	3.5618358556613234

Depending upon this value you get the relation between T c and M e .	4.179515468729916

So , for every temperature there is a M e value and if your , at any point of term your reaction concentration , the free , free monomer or the concentration of your free monomer is higher than the equilibrium monomer concentration , reaction will proceed till the reaction , the mono , free monomer concentration is same as the equilibrium monomer concentration .	3.483746229597409

Let us take an example .	5.674002681604373

Now , for temperature 298 K or 25 degree centigrade , what is the M e for different monomers ?	4.625950017858205

Now , M e you can get , again T is given , T c is given , so that is your temperature reaction .	4.5789474564539585

You can get it from the values of del 0 p and del S p .	3.762322379110075

If you know these , this R you know and your reaction temperature you know , then you will get this value of the free monomer concentration at equilibrium .	3.9690649828354303

So , that is , let us , vinyl acetate , 1 into 10 to power minus 9 moles per liter ; methyl acrylate , moles per liter ; methyl metacrylate ; styrene , moles per liter and alpha methyl styrene , 2.2 moles per liter .	2.4584730363829777

So , if you can carry out a polymerization reaction of these monomers at 25 degree centigrade , the reaction will stop or in accurate sense , reaction will be equilibrium till your monomer concentrations comes down to this level .	3.148767628029456

See , if you start with the pure methyl meta acrylate and do the reactions at 298 degree centigrade , 298 K , at 25 degree centigrade and reaction will proceed , polymerization will proceed till the free concentration or the concentration of the free monomer becomes 10 to the power minus 3 moles per liter , which also means , that you can never complete a reaction , you can never complete 100 percent , entire methyl meta acrylate to the polymer stage because before that there will be stage where equilibrium , where for any temperature where the propagation step and depropagation step are same .	2.8503384347619924

Now , look at the values of alpha methyl styrene , that is , 2.2 moles per liter .	4.635410731245116

Now , the pure , the concentration of pure alpha methyl styrene comes about 7.7 moles per liter .	4.068313702120281

So , these monomers will polymerize at 25 degree centigrade .	4.397754879930087

If you can , of course , 25 degree cannot polymerize because you have to generate , that is very difficult , you have to increase the temperature for the reasons you know .	4.163486991870548

If you can start a polymer or you can polymerize alpha methyl styrene at 25 degree centigrade , then the polymerization will take place till the concentration becomes 2.2 moles per liter .	3.5554897921766986

Once it reaches this value , it will not proceed .	5.2457141893930075

Now , it will be interesting to see what is the value for T c when you start with the pure monomer .	4.760512130426585

That is interesting because if you start with the pure monomer and if your T c is your reaction temperature , then the equilibrium value of your free monomer is same as the pure monomer .	4.11687031512605

That means , reaction will not at all proceed .	5.266153186823584

Now , let us put this number for the same , same monomers , the t c values .	3.4518049122144094

Let me cut this and put this , this is value for equilibrium concentration of the free monomer , at , which is pure monomer .	3.468303728348579

So , what will be the T c ?	6.817571995920807

For styrene it is 310 degree centigrade , for alpha methane styrene is 61 degree centigrade , for styrene is 220 degree centigrade , what does it mean ?	3.2945282375226475

If you start a reaction of alpha methyl styrene from pure monomer at 61 degree centigrade , what will happen ?	3.79135457004533

These are already reached , pure monomer is equilibrium .	4.4578957194722495

So , that means , it has already reached the equilibrium , then it will be never polymerized further .	3.944733314058022

If you do above 61 degree , the M e value is even higher than the pure monomer , which means , again there is no polymerization possible .	3.8658726281621436

I hope you got this concept of this ceiling temperature and how does it influence you polymerization process .	3.246551190521413

So , again , every temperature you can consider as ceiling temperature .	4.169923858250284

Normally , you do reaction little at a higher temperature for , say , at 80 degree or 100 .	3.964590301046609

Now , if you do at 80 degree , then you can only reach polymerization .	4.627925814388091

You can carry out the polymerization till the free monomer concentration reaches the equilibrium value of the temperature and because these numbers are low , 10 to power minus 9 , 10 to power minus 6 and minus 3 , which is considered , say , 25 five degree centigrade .	3.367357525515813

Now , if we increase , say , around this 25 degree centigrade , say 50 degree or say 100 degree , it will come down little bit , go up little bit even though the numbers will be very low , which means , if you do it at 100 centigrade , you almost quantitatively convert the monomers .	2.6617300214395967

But there will be always some free monomer remaining , which is equal to the free monomer concentration at equilibrium for that particular temperature .	4.062907063488665

Now , how do you get the values of T c ?	6.299030025623219

Now , we know that again from that expression .	5.120958205979506

We just talked about plus R ln M e , how do you get the relations between T c and M e ?	3.5560545752242616

If we know the reaction , the values of delta H p and delta S p , now what is delta S p sign ?	4.157574426369622

Del H is negative because it is an exothermic reaction , pi bond is converting to a sigma bond and del S is also less than 0 because the monomers is getting tied up into a more ordered state compared to a disorder state .	2.821544917793635

So , if we , we can plot M versus e versus 1 over T c and from the slope we can , if you know this , by experimental process we can get this values from the slope and interest rate is , so if we know these values we can get the value for del S and del H .	3.3349098663378975

And reverse history , if we know the values of del S and del H , we can find out the relation between the M e and T c .	4.042277358261924

Now , each point , each point in this represents a particular T c and corresponding M e value , which means , that T c is not a singular number , it varies along with your free monomer concentration .	3.167785064730731

Now , how does these numbers , del H and del S , vary with different monomer ?	3.174281298473016

Now , del S is , del H we know is basically the difference in the activation for the propagation reaction and the depropagation reaction .	4.913437141126138

So , if I plot , say , energy and this , your monomer and this is your polymer , so this difference is your del H .	3.5381203801077397

So , anything , anything , which stabilizes this energy , the monomer energy will decrease the difference and over anything , which actually increases the energy of the polymer , the produce or resulting polymer , it also will reduce your magnitude of del H .	2.703902584419009

Now , so anything , if monomer is stabilized , then del H , magnitude of del H will come down .	3.1915160901719792

Now , this stabilization could be due to resonance in the active effect or hyper conjugation or even by inter - monomer association or inter - polymer association and if the polymer is strained , then also this goes up , del H comes down .	2.451660130318591

So , that will depend on the structure of the monomers and we will talk about that more in next lecture .	5.175297484638078

Now , what about del S ?	6.106599930108798

Del S is basically difference between your translational , rotational and vibrational entropy of monomer and polymer .	3.0330055060022647

Now , whatever vibrational , rotational entropy is lost by the monomers is actually gained by the polymer .	3.21468863684788

So , it is basically the entropy , the delay value is basically the entropy of change in , entropy of the translational , entropy of the monomers resulting in a polymer .	4.227816500665476

Now , this translational entropy does not depend too much on the monomers structure .	3.298557277897204

So , we will start next lecture from this , this page and talk about more on the values of del H and del S and how a monomer structure actually determine or influence the value of del H , and which in turn determine the thermodynamic feasibility of polymerization of a monomer .	3.078120781111914

So , we will start from this page in the next lecture .	3.4626515515610623

Continuing from the previous lecture on kinetics of bi - substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions we will be talking about the application of King Altman method to derive rate expression for some of the complex enzyme reaction mechanisms that we often encounter in the bi - substrate reactions .	3.1476170355283455

The second thing after getting the rate expression for those different mechanisms of the bi - substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions is the procedures by which one can discriminate between different mechanisms .	2.9699786259091105

We will be following general principles about that .	3.6902967051855606

Coming first to the application of King Altman method I will try to illustrate it with a simple bi intermediate reaction sequence .	2.999217360176429

It is not bi - substrate but a single substrate .	4.363781726733983

This is just to illustrate the point so that the system does not become complex immediately and we will be able to appreciate .	4.2405129183338905

As I mentioned that the first step in any reaction mechanism would be to express a mechanism in cyclic form so that each of the enzyme species that are present , here as you see there are three enzyme species , E , ES and ET they must form the vertices of the polygon that represents the reaction mechanism .	2.7336625376630064

So you can just write E .	6.211077964452399

It will form a triangle and E to ES , ES to ET and then ET to E .	2.906635112186468

Also show the interaction between the three enzyme species that are present .	4.685079345923657

Mention the rate constant in the form of Kappa values .	7.028843305060694

That means Kappa value for E to ES will be k1.S and this will be k - 1and you will notice that wherever a substrate or product species is involved you will multiply the rate constant with that .	3.4185162014372374

If there is no substrate or product then the rate constant will be as it is .	5.884980431234556

Here you will have k3 and k - 3.p .	7.556195131793769

With this information that is available from the reaction mechanism then we will try to find out the fraction of each of the enzyme species of the total enzyme concentration in the form of the rate constant and the total enzyme concentration .	4.802694871256778

If you consider the first enzyme species let us say E we write down all the possible patterns which contain n - 1 terms where n is the number of enzyme species .	3.081068659216346

For example here the enzyme species are three so we will take all patterns that have two steps only two steps and nothing else and those patterns will be considered .	2.866875258466128

Second thing is that only those patterns which end up in synthesis of that species and not the patterns that lead to the break down or which go away from the species will be considered .	3.0965651709326356

For example in this case since all the steps are reversible there will be three patterns .	4.861394461596926

You will notice that you have k - 1 and k3 .	5.469537540174588

The fraction of this , the total enzyme concentration will be proportional to sum of the product of the Kappa factors .	5.140996860684383

That means E upon E0 will be equal to k - 1.k3 + k - 1.k - 2 + k2.k3 E / E0 = ?	4.800777696505482

? is the sum total of all the Kappa factors .	4.408710886368612

That means all the Kappa factors put together for E , ES and ET .	2.9816317711875633

The numerator whatever we will write for ES and ET will also be added in the denominator so the sigma will be E0 .	3.442468788526863

The concentration of E species will be a fraction which will be given by such an expression .	5.288113200781666

Sigma is the sum total of the products of all the Kappa factors .	4.609315619185277

For example we have the products of Kappa factor for E we will have for ES and also for ET .	3.5173265579720185

So that will represent the E0 or you can write E will be equal to E0 multiplied by the terms in the numerator .	4.26522983319964

Similarly you can write for ES .	9.397983827797006

The ES will be given by again three different patterns .	5.409594719346694

This one here it is k1s and k - 2 , k - 2.k - 3p and k1s and k3 .	4.816742876774344

Here also you will notice that the concentration of E will be E = E0 ( k1.k - 2s + k - 2.k - 3p + k1.k3s ) In the same fashion for ET it will come out to be k - 3.p and k2 , k1s.k2 and k - 1 .	3.3982357955835174

k - 3.p and the fraction of the ET of the total enzyme concentration will be E0 ( k2.k - 3p + k1.k2s + k - 1.k - 3.p ) Now you can write the reaction velocity .	4.652962543105593

[ P ] The rate expression for that will be this expression .	6.026753546027976

You can substitute the value of ET and E in the expression and after deleting all the factors which are positive and negative you come up with E0 ( k1k2k3s - k - 1k - 2k - 3p ) v = ( k - 1 k - 2 + k2 k3 + k - 1 k3 ) + s ( k1 k - 2 + k1 k3 + k1 k2 ) + p ( k - 2 k - 3 + k2k - 3 + k - 1 k - 3 ) This comes out to be the rate expression for such a reaction mechanism .	3.2831457747273642

You can just put p equal to zero that means this term will disappear whole of this term will disappear and the rate expression will become for a irreversible reaction step .	2.823461778203351

So these are the steps .	7.2816451916043095

Just to summarize first of all you write the reaction mechanism in a cyclic manner , write all the Kappa values at each of the inter conversion arrows of the different enzyme species express the fraction of the concentration of a particular enzyme species of the total enzyme concentration in terms of the sum of the products of the Kappa factors and then write the rate expression taking the value of the particular enzyme species from those expression .	3.542547636159278

So that is what we do and one can write rate expression for a complex reaction mechanism .	5.079407614109024

The denominator is total sum of all the Kappa factors of all the three species and because here all the three enzyme species are convertible reversibly all the patterns are coming into picture .	3.01288219168453

But if in a reaction mechanism some of the steps or some of the inter conversions are irreversible in nature then many of the patterns will disappear because there will be no chance of synthesizing that particular species .	3.6884089817126626

But we will consider only those patterns which will consist of n - 1 steps .	4.17046530123016

With this background if we take a general case from a binary substrate reaction that is particularly for the ordered ternary complex formation you will recall that the reaction mechanism in this case was expressed E goes to EA then EA goes to EAB .	3.0873988502789396

Mind it the reaction binding of B from E is not possible in the ordered mechanism .	3.646667367345006

We are considering that only A can bind to free enzyme and then this goes to EY with the release of the product X and this goes to E with the release of the product Y .	3.425294535988673

Let us say this is k1s , k - 1 .	6.621964184705042

This is your k2B , k - 2 , this is k3 , and this is k4 .	5.651462602470355

There are four different enzyme species E , EA , EAB and EY .	3.7138251831144133

The last two steps are irreversible in nature .	4.405397620408296

They only lead to formation of the two products in a sequential manner .	4.545102579285521

If we write for E there should be three different possibilities .	4.077892262529547

One is that the E can synthesized in this route that is your k - 1 , k - 2 and k4 .	3.723771580227046

The other is this can also be synthesized in this form k2B , k3 and k4 and also k - 1 , k3 , k4 .	4.475945986404864

These are the three possible patterns which are possible and so writing for the concentration of E will be E0 ( k - 1 k - 2 k4 + k2 k3 k4 B + k - 1 k3 k4 ) E = ?	3.4621727226170003

The concentration of E will be given by this factor .	5.551534285307753

EA will be formed only by two patterns that is k1A , k - 2 and k4 and k1A , k3 and k4 .	3.8825791367857434

These are the only two patterns which will lead to synthesis of EA and none another because in all other patterns there will be no reversible step .	3.008365686877819

I again like to remind you that just as a matter of convenience we consider only those steps which lead to the synthesis of EA .	3.125479959014081

All the steps which go outside from the EA I am not taking into account .	3.464796045778266

The concentration of EA will be given by E0 ( k1 k - 2 k4 A + k1k3 k4 A ) EA = ?	3.983240899086898

EAB will have only one pattern possible because EAB is emerging only from the E side via E and EA and it cannot come from EY .	2.558627484689553

So you have only one pattern for EAB that is k1A , k2B and k4 .	3.212794563594264

Therefore EAB will be given by E0 ( k1 k2 k4 A B ) EAB = ?	4.634029932410459

Similarly EY will also have only one pattern k1A k2B and k3 .	3.4154743679907273

So this will be given by E0 ( k1k2k3 A.B ) EY = ?	4.750020537687475

So you have now the relative concentrations or the relative fractions of each of the enzyme species that are present .	3.4570185937868967

You recall that in the case of allosteric enzymes also the relative concentration can be arrived from a similar analysis to have the concentration of each of the enzyme species .	4.1896807722497655

From this then you can write down rate of reaction as equal to v = k3 [ EAB ] If you look at the original rate expression the product is being formed .	4.332982814589317

You may have either as k4.EY or you can have k3.EAB .	4.385744768595295

Both the reaction rates will be identical and so you can write as k3.EAB .	5.168395604050262

Right in the main reaction mechanism we are writing A plus B going to X and Y .	3.864091371057118

We are considering a unimolecular reaction .	5.431695491223549

If they are not unimolecular then rates will be different .	4.661858406168094

But as long as we are assuming that the stoichiometric relationship is unimolecular they will be identical .	4.5078975129561645

If you substitute the value of EAB you get E0 k1k3k2k4 A.B ?	4.389883935353507

? is the total sum of all the numerators of earlier species and if you simplify that just by arithmetic manipulation you get an expression like { K3k4 / k3 + k4 } E0.A.B v = k4 ( k - 1k - 2 + k - 1 k3 ) + k4 ( k - 2 + k3 ) A + k3 k4 B + A.B k1k2 ( k3 + k4 ) k2 ( k3 + k4 ) k1 ( k3 + k4 ) We have rearranged it into the format of the general rate expression and in the form of individual rate constant and this term on the numerator indicate the value of Vm .	3.079171189509199

This term is k ’ AkB .	6.461591872948891

This is your kB and this is your kA .	6.208330104421446

From this again by dividing this term you can get the value of k ’ A .	4.071810876911395

This is identical to the generalized rate expression proposed by Alberty .	3.9638811501759617

You can get the individual rate constant in the form of the four parameters that we talked about Vm , k ’ A , kA and kB which represents the kinetic parameters .	3.7534602366733716

In the case of Thorell and Chance mechanism which we consider as a special case of the ordered ternary complex formation we assumed that the complex EAB was very unstable as if the EA directly goes into EY forming a product X and there is no significant concentration of EAB present .	2.79082390352107

This indicates that in the case of Thorell and Chance mechanism k3 term from the reaction mechanism is much , much greater than k - 2 .	3.859315344985883

The condition implying the non - existence of the term , in significant quantities of EAB and direct conversion of EA into EY although it is via EAB , the complex EAB being not very stable , means that k3 is much , much greater than k2 .	2.264373488592688

When you substitute those you get a rate expression as k3.E0.A.B v = k - 1k3 / k1k2 + k3 / k1 B + k3 / k2 A + A.B Again the same pattern of generalized rate expression that we noticed in the case of ternary complex formation and both the type of ternary complex formation will follow the same pattern .	3.7636848139895718

When we talk about the binary complex formation , in the case of ping pong mechanism the pattern will change and that will clearly indicate the existence of a different mechanism .	3.8770075467341885

You can further simplify this by multiplying this by k1 , k2 .	3.289315829522433

k1k2k3.E0.A.B v = k - 1k3 + k2k 3 B + k1k3 A + A.B That is the final expression for Thorell and Chance mechanism and therefore one can go into such a mechanism and get rate expression .	3.18709325652858

The practical utility is two things .	5.1409562376278

One is to understand the reaction mechanism that a particular reaction follows and second thing is design of reactors .	3.683160399462197

You read the kinetic rate expression and the individual rate constants if you want to really design and get the final simulated values and all other simulated profiles for the reactor performance .	3.156932735373992

The significance of the kinetic studies allows you to understand the reaction mechanism .	4.353101029748969

By getting their individual rate constants you can also manipulate them for the design of reactors and for simulation work .	3.155384623555164

The information on the individual rate constant will also give you an understanding on how the enzymes will function at the metabolic level .	3.5555238264920637

A simple example is glycolytic enzymes for example hexokinase .	3.7300659964705

The glucose can enter into more than one metabolic pathway .	4.255053858270982

Which metabolic pathway it will enter requires understanding of the reaction mechanism and individual rate constants .	4.2793984658272155

It is significant to note that most of the enzymes that are present in the living cells are bi - substrate reactions .	4.47340966074856

Bi - substrate reactions can be understood and for the sake of simplicity have been analyzed keeping in view the Michaelis–Menten kinetics .	3.3554049929933623

But always it may not apply because the concentration of the second substrate will never be in excess in the living cell .	4.112483874868225

That will always be in comparable concentration and therefore it will be always useful to have understanding of the mechanism .	4.7066963487196585

The other bi - substrate reaction mechanism was a binary complex formation and the case which we talked about was Ping Pong mechanism which states that at no state ternary complex forms .	2.869169226677817

The reaction mechanism as we have expressed earlier is k1A , k - 1 , EA .	4.558484310890429

Here at this stage a modified enzyme complex and product X will be released with k2 , k3B and you get E ’ B .	3.52156581674429

You again get another product form y and with the k4 rate constant .	3.4484648758894854

There is only one reversible step here when the first substrate binds to enzyme rest of the steps are irreversible steps .	3.173823300649274

The four different enzyme species present here E , E ’ A , E ’ and E ’ B .	3.319361441702973

For E you can write the pattern as k - 1 , k3B and k4 .	4.634275432069174

Similarly you have another pattern k2 , k3B and k4 and the relative concentration of the enzyme species E will be E0 ( k - 1k3k4B + k2k3k4B ) ?	4.24820688191342

Similarly for EA you will get only one pattern which will be feasible that is you are going in the anti - clockwise fashion that is your k3B , k4 and k1.A and the relative concentration will be E0 ( k1k3k4 B.A ) ?	3.7791308092485107

For E ’ you again have only one pattern that is k2 , k1A and k4 and that will be E0 ( k1k2k4 A ) ?	4.53290206526283

E ’ B will also have only one pattern k1A , k2 , k3B and you will get E0 ( k1k2k3 A.B ) ?	3.9976951396592098

So having the relative concentration of each of the enzyme species then you can always write the rate expression that is your v as equal to v = k4.E ’ B = k2.EA It can be either k4.E ’ B or it can be k2.EA .	3.7669701705341208

Either of that can be written .	10.855082320550611

Therefore again you can substitute the values and get reaction velocity expression as E0 k1k2 k3 k4 .	3.471938031383021

A . B v = k1k2k4.A + k3k4 ( k - 1 + k2 ) .B + k1k3 ( k2 + k4 ) A.B If you try to bring it in the form of generalized rate expression you get k2k4 / ( k2 + k4 ) .	3.7075702335545557

E0.A.B k2k4 A + k4 ( k - 1 + k2 ) B + A.B k3 ( k2 + k4 ) k1 ( k2 + k4 ) You notice a significant difference from the generalized rate expression .	3.407875558259911

You have the Vm term , you have the kB term and you have kA term .	4.3718416336935215

But the k ’ A.kB term is missing which implies in the case of pong ping pong reaction mechanism , the term k ’ A is zero and that makes a very big point to discriminate between the different reaction mechanisms .	2.4850738468284415

At least you can distinguish whether the enzyme reaction follows the binary complex mechanism or ternary complex mechanism by just evaluating the value of k ’ A .	3.1478039474620725

Earlier we talked about the analysis of the bi - substrate data based on the double reciprocal plot and the secondary plots of the slope and intercepts .	4.282458133058264

If you plot 1 / A and 1 / v you get a profile like this with B varying and if you plot slope vs 1 / v and similarly intercept versus 1 / v you can determine the value of kA , kB , k ’ A and Vm .	3.942887047810244

By analyzing these parameters one can distinguish if the magnitude of k ’ A is zero and one can conclude that the reaction mechanism under study follows the binary reaction mechanism .	3.400935977018434

That means that the dissociation of that , that is the break down of the EA complex is very , very slow .	4.829296699789957

Zero means the magnitude goes to a very small value .	5.52359557706461

It becomes a very stable system .	8.064468557574264

The second part of today ’ s lecture is to discriminate between the different reaction mechanisms .	3.011495509665556

One of the tools we have got is the analysis of the reaction rate data based on double reciprocal plot .	3.8124585651183023

We can easily distinguish and get the magnitudes of the values of the various kinetics parameters Vm , kA , kB and k ’ A and if the magnitude of k ’ A is negligible or zero one can conclude that it is binary reaction mechanism and not ternary .	3.0706049900922525

Unfortunately this analysis will not yield any information about whether it is an ordered or a random ternary complex formation mechanism because in both cases the rate pattern will be identical although the magnitude of the kA , kB and k ’ A might vary but they may have a positive value .	2.7031974086154658

Because if you study the use of one of the products of these bi - substrate reaction as an inhibitor and see their interaction with the effect on the rate expression you will notice that the different products X or Y when used as an inhibitor they give rise to different pattern of inhibition , which we noted earlier .	3.1903509427389123

That means un - competitive , non - competitive or a linear mix and the linear mix was a case of non - competitive inhibition .	2.993407904122382

I will not go into detailed analysis of those because they will only have very long expressions .	2.9366194592466757

But if you consider the summary of the rate equations , I summarized here the random ternary complex formation .	3.4124228460062422

It is exactly identical to that of a generalized rate expression ordered ternary complex that we have written today and Thorell and Chance mechanism and Ping pong mechanism and the species in the brackets are the ones that correspond to that enzyme species .	2.6123242900236465

For studying the inhibition pattern of each of the product used as an inhibitor let us consider a compulsory order ternary complex formation in which the substrate A binds first .	3.867669946821628

Use the two products Y or X separately as inhibitors in the reaction and notice the effect of Y and X as the nature of inhibition .	3.6806292574837833

With respect to the varying A you get a competitive inhibition pattern .	4.943797667373123

With respect to X as the inhibitor you get a mixed inhibition .	4.641675838228093

You get a completely different pattern and as you recall that when we discussed the inhibition patterns we also mentioned very clearly that major use of the inhibition patterns is in the analyses of the bi - substrate reactions to identify their reaction mechanism .	3.217177497060309

One can derive these expressions and get the different types of inhibition pattern .	4.810942347080959

This is just a summary of the whole thing .	5.415075615846023

When you take A binding first , you know the product and out of the two as an inhibitor you get a different pattern and with respect to varying B you get a different pattern .	4.189176840915096

So by getting the inhibition data on the bi - substrate reaction kinetics either by choosing one product or the other product one can get a set of data and from which one can conclude by the ordered ternary complex formation or a random ternary complex formation Identifying Ping - pong bi - bi or the ping pong mechanism directly from the effect of substrate concentration on the reaction rate itself can lead you to that kind of scenario .	2.677010214430057

The combination of the two studies particularly the effect of substrate concentration and studying the nature of inhibition with respect to one or more of the products will give you the nature of inhibition pattern and that information can give you a conclusion about the nature of the reaction mechanism .	4.130497147246466

Most of the reactions that lead to such kind of inhibition patterns have been then concluded to follow one or the other ordered or ternary complex mechanism formation .	2.862600408377748

With this we will be completing our kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reaction .	4.221428630911084

Just to summarize what we have covered so far in the kinetics we have initially looked at single substrate single intermediate reactions leading to hyperbolic kinetics and the validity of this kinetic pattern to a whole range of reactions under different conditions .	2.5724620320490734

Thirdly we came to inhibition patterns with respect to the single substrate reactions and the effect on the inhibitor concentration on the reaction rate and also the effect of activators on the reaction rate .	4.378778653149783

Then we came to the effect of pH and effect of temperature .	5.094684676076198

They are used for understanding reaction thermodynamic parameters and other mechanistic aspects .	3.6225792537039077

Then we came to bi - substrate reactions and the effect of substrate concentration , writing the rate expression and finally concluding with the discrimination of various reaction mechanisms that are involved in bi - substrate reactions .	3.0126730338974794

That summarizes the whole of whatever we have covered in enzyme kinetics .	4.405731945701127

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In the last lecture we have started our discussion on polymer molecular determination , and we actually discussed how to get the viscosity average molecular weight .	3.143447354049158

Now , in this lecture we will start discussing about techniques which will enable us to get the number average molecular weight .	3.333590845421165

And then following this discussion on how to get number average molecular weight , we will start discussion on determination of weight average molecular weight by light scattering .	3.8732897799841335

This discussion may not end ; this lecture we will continue in the following lecture .	3.890388056581308

Let us start with membrane osmometry .	4.705683733882204

You know all of us know about colligative properties you know from our physical chemistry knowledge ’ s .	3.2179632336506

Colligative properties are those properties of a solution which depends only on the number of solute molecules , provided the solute molecules are nonvolatile and we are doing the measurements at very dilute solutions .	3.5203740537001904

These properties are called colligative properties and we know that there are four colligative properties ; osmotic pressure of the solution , lowering of solvent vapor pressure , elevation of solvent boiling point , and depression of solvent freezing point .	2.7939807186681325

We will discuss the osmotic pressure method in detail following by brief discussion on solvent vapor pressure lowering method and we will just mention about the third and fourth properties .	2.876571255679699

Let us start with membrane osmometry .	4.705683733882204

You know what happened in membrane osmometry ?	5.790527427779588

You have a solution in this case polymer solution and the solvent for the solution separated by a membrane which is permeable only to the solvent not the solute .	4.069686865536522

So , solvent can go from solvent side to the solution sides not the solute molecules .	3.2495300833766705

Now this case arises ; the osmotic pressure difference between the two sides and the solvent because of the chemical potential difference .	5.200587362980627

The chemical potential of solvent molecule in this side is higher than the chemical potential of the solvent in this side which makes solvents to move from solvent side to solution sides and thus increasing the pressure .	3.2155251795010344

If you have a capillary , then there will be rise in the height of the capillary and this will continue till this additional pressure compensate or increases the chemical potential volume of the solvent this side equals to such a extent that it becomes equals to the chemical potential of the solvent in this side .	3.0420640341977725

Similarly you can design another equipment where you have a polymer solutions in this capillary and which is separated by a semipermeable membrane which is only permeable to the solvent molecules .	3.311712014504396

And as osmosis , the pressure of the polymer solution side goes up and this excess pressure here ; this excess pressure and this residue are called the osmotic pressure .	3.1559983836473227

Now as we discussing that this side the solvent chemical potential is higher for a pure solvent than in polymer solution .	2.8954984789906693

So , the osmosis happens .	7.585488910465122

Now so mu if we write 1 for the solvent molecule and this superscript of 0 having for pure solvent at say , original pressure P will be equal to the chemical potential of the solvent where the pressure is increased from P to P plus pi where pi is the osmotic pressure .	2.7493804431146267

So , this is the condition from condition for the equilibrium between the solution side and the solvent side and the solution side .	3.8968253560051713

So , I can write this and breakdowns this mathematically and just write this one ; remember 1 for the solvent and we generally write 2 for the solute molecules .	2.890950777217937

Solute in this case it is the polymer .	10.352332407896428

So , we can rearrange this .	7.2163756039384435

So , we can just remove the pressure terms from the bracket and we can write from the definition of mu pi we can write using the help of the partial differential .	3.2562522787369397

This is nothing but this is the osmotic pressure which we can detect through our measurement and this is the partial molar volume of the solvent and for a very dilute solution which is our working condition .	4.444090177164573

This partial molar volume can be replaced by just molar volume of the solvent .	3.815658197685527

Now this term we have already determined this term from Flory - Huggins equation in our earlier lecture and this is equivalent to if you can recollect from your knowledge .	3.8918027668838557

This term mu 1 minus mu 1 0 is minus RT phi 2 x ; phi 2 is the volume fraction of the solvent molecules , x is the number of segment of the polymer molecules and so on .	3.7618814414783177

So if you compare these two expressions , the one we already wrote in this page and the expressions which we know from Flory - Huggins equation we can write pi is RT .	3.2087933402536986

So , for dilute solution it can be mathematically shown that we can write the above expression like this where chi as you know chi is the solvent - solute interaction parameter , rho 2 is the density of the polymer molecule , M n is the number average molecular weight This c is the concentration , concentration in mass per unit volume .	3.484530392560179

So , c is concentration mass per unit volume .	4.093298706112353

Now as we know that this expression the Flory - Huggins expression , this is from Flory - Huggins theory , Flory - Huggins theory is not applicable for dilute solutions ; we can write this expression as instead of this we can write this expression like earlier cases , we can write this as a variant expression .	3.654190613285371

So , instead of like this we can write A 2 c plus A 3 c square like this where A 2 is nothing but this term .	4.010326855013721

So , this term this term is nothing but A 2 .	5.325286188871529

So , this is the expression we can utilize to get the number average molecular weight of a polymer from dilute polymer solution .	4.861647375998812

So , what we need to do ?	5.97461184340737

We need to make few polymer solutions dilute .	4.43993097455979

So , we can make few dilute polymer solutions having different concentration and then measure pi of each of this solutions and then plot pi c versus c which may be something like this .	2.920366939500352

And then extra plot this value to c equals to 0 .	3.6521315650550568

So , this intercept is nothing but pi by c at c is equal to 0 .	3.5850197973736826

This is from this expression this will be RT by M n and the slope will give the value for the second period coefficient from which we can get the value for polymer solvent interaction parameter chi .	4.493631447280748

Now in terms of experiment , what are the things we should remember ; one is that temperature control has to be very precise because osmotic pressure is very much dependent on temperature .	3.5386832885811623

So , it has to be very much controlled and we have to keep all this polymer solutions sufficiently dilute .	4.538172444877407

So , that typically we get or we make solutions having concentration having less than 20 gram per liter .	2.5783449787580373

Typically we make concentrations 20 gram so that equations are valid .	3.195810109208163

If the solvent becomes good , then the term A 3 in the expression ; if the solvent becomes sufficiently good then this term may become significant which means c square terms may also contribute and if A 3 becomes significant then c square terms contribute .	2.159372418618771

And if the polymer solvent system is theta solvent for that particular temperature at temperature of experiment , then A 2 , A 3 this will all become 0 which means it will be the osmotic pressure by c will be concentration independent .	3.34502884366156

This is what happened .	7.578992445208905

For example if we have , for polymethyl methacrylate PMMA toluene is very good solvent .	3.2218683481348283

So , we start to get contribution from the A 3 term or c squared term .	2.887698814359112

So , the curve deviates from linearity at high concentration .	3.5509626534697367

This is what happened for acetone and acetonitrile is a theta solvent for the temperature where this temperature for PMMA which means the pi by c will be independent of the concentration of the solution .	3.3927573593045537

So by this way , we can get the number average molecular weight .	4.939834979591888

We can also determine A 2 by plotting or getting or determining A 2 at different temperature ; with this expression from the slope we can get A 2 .	3.041118947840823

So , from the slope we can A 2 as we can see from this expression and if we measure or if we determine A 2 at different temperature and then plot A 2 versus T and then the temperature for which A 2 is 0 ; the temperature for which A 2 is 0 that would be the theta temperature .	3.3429089670406897

So , this is one way we can determine the theta temperature .	5.635744351603879

What are the considerations we must do as we can see that we do not require any calibration for this method ?	3.615470005636465

So , osmotic membrane osmometry is an absolute method .	4.698502418413782

So , you do not need any calibration .	4.544819773444357

So , if you make a new polymer you can get the molecular weight number average molecular weight from first principle .	5.136807984758298

You do not need any calibration .	6.045231374037667

Now to make the experiment short , this equilibration between the solvent side and solute side must be fast .	3.183014634074179

So , equilibrium equilibration time must be short which can be done either by small cell volume or by high membrane surface area .	2.936172297517898

We also need very highly pressure sensitive equipment because the osmotic value of osmotic pressure is quite low so that we can accurately determine the osmotic pressure .	2.5849183985040036

And as we can see that for a given concentration of solution if we increase the molecular weight , the number of molecules goes down .	4.470451950244921

So , for a given concentration if we increase molecular weight , the number of molecules goes down so as osmotic pressure .	4.383067776337248

It can determine typically up to 10 to the power 5 to 10 to the power 6 mole per inverse molecular weight .	3.038802431352249

It cannot determine more than that because if we increase weight further , then the osmotic pressure becomes very small .	3.6678214313638438

The lower cutoff for this method is determined by the cutoff of the membrane which is used because if the membrane has a higher cutoff , then the polymers chains which have smaller M n that will pass through the membrane to the solvent side and then it will contribute in the osmotic pressure .	3.0102405709794393

So , we must be very careful that the samples which we are determining the M n must be the weight of very small molecular weights .	3.469673026991423

Otherwise those molecular weights will not contribute in the osmotic pressure and hence the determined M n number average molecular weight .	3.0753871149547836

So typically , if a polymer sample has quite a few fraction of low molecular weights which are below the cutoff of the membrane , then the M n or the number average molecular weight determined by this method typically becomes little lower estimated .	2.822825786991038

So , these are the criteria ’ s or these are parameters we must remember while determining molecular weight by this method .	3.1114928367347594

Let us move on and try out ; some other points which we must just to add some more points in this membrane osmometry that the membranes are different for different solvent .	2.4290855807916296

For organic solvents it could be cellulose or gel cellophane ; aqueous we can use cellulose acetate , nitrocellulose and if you have a corrosive solution , then we can use glass membranes .	3.6180687361115274

Membranes porosity and this situation must be considered because that will determine the lower cutoff and its surface area also continued to the time it requires for equilibration .	2.6925766367942514

And typically membranes are supplied in a in a wet conditions in a particular solvent like isopropanol .	3.560678630140127

So , if the solvent you have in your hand is dried - out , then this nature might go bad .	3.316895495498557

When we may start the experiment they are wet with the solvent which of our interest .	3.0364684284626184

With this let us move on the next technique of determining the number average molecular weight , vapor pressure osmometry .	3.599854018655685

In this method these are the two thermistors which are kept for determining temperature difference as low as 10 to the power minus 4 Kelvin .	3.3481205673630297

They are placed in a sealed thermostated chamber which is saturated with the solvent vapor .	3.441961751589294

Now in these conditions , one with a syringe in one thermistor one solvent drop is placed ; in another thermistor or solution polymer solution drop is placed .	2.3664250731971945

And as a result the solvent vapor will condense on this thermistor and the heat of condensation will increase the temperature of this thermistor and equilibrium should arise where the vapor pressure of the solvent in this elevated temperature is same as the vapor pressure of the pure solvent in the temperature of the thermostat .	2.938464524344568

So , basically we started with a VPO vapor pressure osmometry .	3.5273929041742105

We started , say , with T initial which is the thermostated the temperature for the thermostated chamber which is filled up with solvent vapor and we add one drop of solution in one thermsitor and one drop of solvent in the other thermistor .	2.4896782054125834

So , the vapor pressure will lower and we can write if P 1 is the vapor pressure of the solvent in the final temperature ; the elevated temperature because of the condensation of the vapor solvent vapor from vapor phase to the solution phase which will be equal at the initial vapor pressure So , that is the equilibrium condition when the condensation stops .	3.219113147584339

Remember this is the P 1 is to present the vapor pressure of the solvent in polymer solution if this elevated temperature whereas P 1 0 is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent at the original temperature .	3.2244920153845094

Now we can apply Clausius - Clapeyron equation and write del P del T is del H vaporization by T V m ; V m is molar volume and if you consider the vapor is the ideal gas , considering the ideal gas vapor we can do few mathematical steps to write .	2.6198380645675927

At T e represents at equilibrium .	5.114779373281446

So , while deducing consider that the vapor phase V f as a ideal gas .	3.285218460417386

Now because T f is very close to T I , we can simply write this expression at P 1 by P 1 0 as minus del H vaporization delta T e by R T i square .	2.7222932642898714

Now this term is nothing but ln activity of the solvent .	5.317550541333002

Now from thermodynamics we can write the mu 1 as mu 1 by mu 1 0 by RT ; you know this is 40 i .	3.534309982359493

So , we are not writing T i T i .	4.2184565413949535

So , these are all T i initial thermostat temperature of the medium .	4.070697942235078

Now Flory - Huggins equation we can write mu i by mu 0 as earlier case we have seen from the osmotic pressure experiment we can simply write this .	3.6173522247476235

So , from there we can write that .	8.008943115412304

So , if you start from this expression we can write RT ln this side the left hand side .	4.138218254861843

So , we can write like this RT .	5.181339114124994

So , if you compare the earlier equation and the osmotic pressure the derivation we did for osmotic pressure , we can simply write this part as minus V 1 , see V 1 is the molar volume of the solvent , 1 by M n minus del H vaporization delta T e ; so delta T e by C K e 1 by M n .	2.6052670553285897

So basically if we can get the delta e , now we can apply the same similar experimental procedure ; like osmotic pressure measurement we can make five different or few different dilute solutions of different concentration and measure the delta T e and then plot delta T e by C with concentration to get K e by M n and A 2 .	2.6561125039928277

In practice , we actually do not reach to the equilibrium because some of heats of the condensation of the droplets , I should get dissipated on thermistor and the solvent stream .	2.671194367553914

So , what we reach is not a true equilibrium ; it is a steady state .	4.993202619360163

So , we need to calibrate the experiment with the known molecular weight polymer solutions to actually determine the number average molecular for the unknown samples .	3.308599761534119

So , this is not an absolute method ; we need calibration .	4.50301232850187

So , actually what we plot is delta s by C versus C ; delta T s is the steady state temperature difference as steady state which again is measured by the difference in the resistance between the two thermistors versus C .	2.6358808217693697

So , we know this .	10.229490608260685

So , we can get the molecular weight M n for the unknown sample .	5.278552026117064

This is very useful method for low molecular weight samples because if we go for high molecular weight then the increase in the temperature is very low .	4.294321761653424

So , we do not have the techniques to determine so much , so low temperature difference between thermistors .	3.0847473179202316

Typically we can go up to 10 to the power difference of temperature between the two thermistor as low as 10 to the power 4 Kelvin which translate to upper limit of the upper limit of the molecular weight M n , upper limit of M n approximately 10 to the power 4 order gram per mol .	3.175831194358471

This is the upper limit of this .	5.415475650343418

So , if you can get more sophisticated instrument which can detect the temperature difference even lower than this , then you can increase the upper limit of the molecular weight determination in this technique .	3.4828298420241492

Now similar techniques similar methods can be applied to the other two methods like other two colligative properties ; for example this similarly the same logic can be applied or same principle can be applied to other two methods like ebulliometry which deals with the elevation of boiling point ; boiling point elevation of boiling point where delta T e is T b minus T 0 where T b is the boiling point of the solution and T 0 is the boiling point of the pure solvent .	2.446991085376629

But these are techniques and not used much ; nowadays these techniques are not used much for several reasons though mainly this techniques like osmotic membrane osmometry and vapor pressure osmometry are used and as we have discussed that they are complimentary to each other where membrane osmometry can determine molecular weight , number of molecular weight for little higher range and vapor pressure osmometry can be used for determining molecular rates of low molecular weights of lower range .	2.663519942487892

Let us have brief discussion about the third technique which is end group determination .	3.0422788242756877

By determining the end group quantitatively , we can also determine the molecular weight ; quantitative determination of end group gives M n number average molecular weight .	3.3360292302835326

The requirements are that basically we will be able to quantitatively determination of end groups of the polymer .	4.420793629642176

So , polymers must have amenable end groups which can be analyzed by say titrometry or spectophotometrically and concentration must be high enough , so that we can determine the concentration of end group accurately or quantitatively , and the other group presence in the polymer should not interfere in the determination of the end groups of our interest .	3.213701166096057

Secondly , we must know the number of end groups per polymer chain .	5.177945854857289

So , each polymer chain how many per polymer chain .	4.005148255752399

So , how many chains they have .	5.806384653859559

So , if you have like typically in a linear polymer we have two ends and if they hit the branch and it has three ends , then obviously we must know that this case the sample has two chain ends end groups and this case the sample has three end groups ; otherwise the analysis will be erratic with error in the values .	2.994188315690305

Typically this method is applied to step - growth polymers because we know that step - growth polymers produces end groups functional end groups in the end .	4.146142791948904

For example , polyester ; polyester it has O H and COOH group .	3.224755630239601

So , we can determine titrometrically or spectroscopically these group polyamides NH 2 , COOH groups or polyurethane .	2.626408763999909

So , these groups can be determined significantly .	5.895218516950582

This is applicable to again to low molecular weights because when the polymer chains becomes very high , the number of end groups the contribution from number of end groups becomes very small .	3.4315275755306445

So , detection becomes very difficult .	6.510210663605536

So , this method typically applies to low molecular weights and typically M n value of around 10 to the power 4 to in the range of 10 to power 4 is the upper limit by which we can determine by these methods .	2.887920926386606

What we measure is basically M e is the equilibrium equivalent mass is M by n which is defined as M by n ; M is the mass of the polymers or concentration of the polymers and n is the concentration of the end groups .	4.280926621066337

So if we can determine the concentration , we know the concentration of the polymer and what is the concentration of end group which we determined .	6.0271081253370715

We can determine n , the concentration of end groups and then if you know f which is the number of end groups per polymer chain , then we can easily get the number average molecular weight .	4.263122586792028

Now we will give specific examples of determination of end group by spectroscopic method when we discuss the spectroscopy method of polymer characterization in the next or two lectures from now onwards , when we give specific examples of how to determine polymer number average molecular weight by end group determinations spectroscopically .	2.5503000211700413

Before we move on to other methods of determining polymer molecular weight and namely weight average molecular weight , just to emphasize one point that we know the M n is very much sensitive to the low molecular weight species present at the impurities in a polymer sample .	3.5915552558267323

For example , if we give a specific example if we have impurities , what were the impurities present in our polymer sample and we analyze that sample .	2.9669806228602957

Actually if the M n for the pure polymer sample is 10000 , then if you have 0.01 weight factor of impurity , then the measured M n of the impure would be about 1500 .	3.144868698631337

So , basically even 1 percent by weight presence of water impurities is decreasing your determine M n by several factor which means we must be very careful about the impurities ; specially the low molecular impurities while determination of number average molecular weight because they have a very detrimental effect in the value we get from the number average molecular weight determination .	2.853197395589993

Let us move on to the next topic where we determine the weight average molecular rate of the polymers and we will discuss the techniques of light scattering and subsequently gene plot to get the weight average molecular weight and also some other important parameters of polymers like the second variant coefficient and polymer solvent interaction parameters and the radius of gyration .	3.523146744941135

So , what is light scattering ?	6.071185108694239

Light scattering as we know when electromagnetic radiation interacts with a molecule or a particle , it induces a dipole in the samples and the magnitude of the dipole will depend on how the charge can be separated .	2.7961441899482273

Now once this dipole is formed , it oscillates with the electromagnetic radiation and as we know that oscillating dipole radiates light or electromagnetic radiation .	2.9687142436648974

So in this case , this oscillating dipole width emits radiation or electromagnetic radiation at all direction which are the scattered light .	2.9170312283277244

And typically this scattered lights have same frequency as the incident light but there are cases where there are shift in the frequency of the scattered light than in comparison to the incident light , but those are called inelastic scattering but for this determination of molecular , we will restrict to only through elastic scattering where the frequency of the scattered light is same as the frequency of the incident light .	2.563967333949133

So , what is done in the experiments ?	4.671498931526806

An incident beam is bombarded on a sample cell which contains these polymer molecules polymer solutions and then the scattered light is detected ; the intensity of the scattered light is detected at an angle theta with the incident beam .	2.6289551056215834

Now this intensity of the scattered light can be fluctuating with very short time ; the time scale is very short like micro seconds to milliseconds .	2.6899193910638988

Then you have a fluctuation in the scattering intensity is detected by the detector .	4.496898930615008

Now from this fluctuation of the scatter intensity which we can apply techniques ; this is like dynamic light scattering which take advantage of this fluctuation and we can get information about hydrodynamic radius for the polymer molecules And the time average intensity which we will use in the techniques called static light scattering which will give the information about absolute molecular weight , weight average molecular weight , the radius of gyration and the second semiempirical coefficient which will in turn give the information about polymer solvent interaction parameter .	3.1493051115023842

So , basically the light scattering techniques can be used in two ways ; in static light scattering where we deal with the time average intensity of the scattered light and second technique can be used where we use the fluctuation of the static intensity in dynamic light scattering which gives the information about the radius of gyration .	2.988019706608181

Let us first talk about the static light scattering , because it gives many information for polymer solution .	3.394428106022348

So , basically the techniques which are used are utilized to determine or to get information about polymers samples as multi angle light scattering or small angle x - ray scattering or small angle neutron scattering .	2.7345540113982665

We will basically restrict our discussion mainly on multi angle light scattering and then we will just briefly mention the difference of small angle x - ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering with light scattering and what are the information you can get from and SAXS and SANS .	2.7582395246611857

So , without going much into the theory of light scattering , let us go into the theory directly into the equations for the light scattering from dilute polymer solutions .	3.2008533175829568

So , if you consider a polymer solution , where if you consider the polymer solutions , now if you consider its area any area or any particular area from this solution which contain pure solvent another part contain the solute and the solvent .	3.0273824957011195

So each cell on an average , these are the assumption we are taking and on basis of which we will formulate this scattering equations .	3.5374516453548526

The each cell has on average the same number of solvent molecules but the scattering happens .	3.3212312665058814

So , weak scattering happened because of the minute fluctuation in the solvent density and because of the solute molecule itself , the concentration of solute molecules fluctuate ; either because of the translational motion Brownian motion of the solute molecules or if it is a polymer large molecule there will be conformational changes .	3.9028996434496026

So because of the effective concentration fluctuation , the light scattering happens from the polymer of the solute molecules .	4.549791544583556

So , what to do to get the information about the polymer molecules or the solute molecules , we deduct the scattering from the solution from the solvent to get the excess scattering ; we will explain the terms R in the next page .	3.3770109488445703

So basically in the instrument , we try to detect the scatterings only from the solute molecule in this case the polymer molecule in a dilute solution so that there are not much intermolecular interactions and we deduct the scattering which we detect for or determine from a solute solution from the solvent so that we can get the information of on scattering from only from the solute molecules .	2.765595430241973

So , we directly go to the scattering equation which based on the basic Rayleigh equation for light scattering and then also from the fluctuation theory based on Eintsein and Smoluchowski .	2.722681665407898

This is for a small molecule ; the solute having a small molecule point scatterer .	3.9902280528255663

So , we can get an equation like this where R is delta R theta is as we said that the Rayleigh ratio ; this R for Rayleigh ratio basically take cares of the intensity .	2.895734241532837

It is basically the intensity ; it is basically the scattering intensity which is normalized with the scattering angle .	3.9861846932400926

So , Rayleigh ratio is basically this expression and delta R theta is nothing but Rayleigh ratio for the particular theta for the solution minus Rayleigh ratio for the solvent .	3.3593733000650614

We define K in all the terms which we know .	5.410243127373973

So , for the experiments we know this n 0 or eta 0 is the solvent refractive index , d n by d c is the specific refractive index increment for the solute , lambda is the web length of the incident light , N A is Avogadro number .	2.718259614714286

So , we know all this terms and we define a term called optical constant k as this to make this expression simpler .	3.025722322440459

So finally , we can get an equation like this .	5.075578897369731

So , this expression is valid for point scatterer where no intramolecular interference happen between them no interference happened between the scattered light ; the same scattered light originate from the different parts of a scatterer .	2.4122988568727863

So , basically we can write or we can say that as a basic principle of light scattering that first principle is that amount of light scattering is directly proportional to the product of polymer molar mass M and concentration and this term which is specific refractive index increment .	3.5637099752756125

This is proportional to the concentration only for dilute solution where the intersolute molecule interaction is absent , basically then we can add the scattering intensity from different molecules without considering any destructive interference between them .	2.8505056996985925

Now if we are just talking about this expression at point scatterer where the molecule does not or the scattering from different parts of the molecules do not interfere with each other .	3.4809645217514187

If we plot the Rayleigh ratio with different angle that will give the same intensity ; remember we are talking about Rayleigh ratio which have cos square theta term in the denominator .	3.050445187567608

If you only consider the i theta by I 0 then for small molecules your intensity will look like something like this .	2.8952759599646165

So , this is 0 angle , and this is 180 angle , this is 90 degree .	6.198544674315728

But if we plot this Rayleigh ratio ; so what we will do we will start from .	4.097378704625416

In the next lecture we will discuss the scattering from angular dependence on the light scattering for large molecule or polymer molecules which we have angular dependence ; the light scattering will be angular dependence .	3.472966026373142

We will start from there in the next lecture .	4.063192524494743

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and today we are going to move from of discussion , on step growth polymers to chain growth polymerization .	2.7502460549796086

And we will begin with radical chain polymerization , for about four to five lectures , followed by ionic polymerization , and other types of chain polymerization , later lectures .	3.5205110092471164

In this lecture we are going to cover , general features of chain polymerization , which we will basically revisit from our introduction lecture .	3.845666801517739

And then we will talk about feasibility of chain polymerization , how the structure of monomers determines , which type of initiator would choose , and different modes of propagation of a free , in a free radical polymerization , different types of initiator and initiator efficiency .	2.8934483550271053

Now let us revisit , the discussion we had on chain polymerization in first two , lectures during introduction .	3.4298279608730216

What are the general features of a , chain polymerization process .	5.443231592373501

In the step polymerization we have seen that we need , at least two functional groups , so that the reaction can happen between the functional groups , but in case of chain polymerization , we need one functional group , mono functional group , in most cases it is a double bond .	4.654026629738385

We can do polymerization , chain polymerization with more than one functional group as well , but then in that case like the previous case of step polymerization , it will give cross linking in the polymerization , not the complete linear polymerization .	3.7838838851411793

So if you have only one functional group in this case double bond , it is sufficient to give you linear polymers .	4.404325864573081

Now , polymerization , chain polymerization are in general consist of three steps ; three main step , initiation , propagation , and termination .	2.9233730077901443

In initiation step , initiator reactive species R is formed , from initiator molecule I , this reactive species then react with a monomer , gives you a chain initiating species .	2.958629805031892

This will initiate chain , by reaction reacting with further monomers , forming extended chain , and this will progressed to make a complete polymers .	3.0326600749787493

So this is part of initiation steps , this is propagation steps , and also we have termination step .	3.0935112948230055

You also have another step ; you know another possible step like , transfer , reactions which we will discuss when it is necessary .	3.060635670232805

So in this case , you require a reactive species , to initiate the polymer chain , unlike in step polymerization , where you did not require a , in the reactive species .	3.311570028657592

And depending upon this nature of this reacting species R splash , you can classify these chain polymerization reactions in different types ; for example if the R star is , reactive species in this case , is a free radical , then we name this reaction or polymerization as a free radical polymerization .	2.8753672502099015

If this is a cation , then it is a cationic polymerization , if this is a anion , then it is a anionic polymerization .	7.335343833929604

chain polymerization could be other types as well , for example polymers using , type of , other type of catalyst like catalyst , and also it could be , different other types which are not the majority , or a major class of chain polymerization , but they also are part of the group of chain polymerization ; for example ring - opening polymerization , group - transfer polymerization and so on .	3.298133981092643

We will talk about these polymerizations , when in a later lectures briefly .	3.3533366775892177

We will come back to the general features of chain polymerization , we by this time you know that , we can build linear polymers in chain polymers from a mono functional group .	3.70187307920833

Then chain polymerization is usually consist of three main step ; initiation , propagation , and termination .	3.1508780483703145

And usually there is no loss of molecular fragments , like , in case step polymers , we had stormed , small molecular condensates , where coming out , during polymerization process , but in this case there is no loss of fragments .	2.889371573570691

And we also know from our original discussion that , we don ’ t require high conversion .	3.3505791705267307

Unlike a step growth polymerization , where we require a high conversion to a high molecular rate , in this case , we do not require a high conversions to build a high molecular rate .	4.155945304982072

If you recollect from the discussion we had , in the first two lectures that , in case of chain polymerization , the molecular rates builds very soon , and then it says , at very low conversion itself , it builds very high molecular weight , and the molecular weight remains has high , you know and very high during the conversion .	3.21131559856716

There are some other things might results , in change in this nature of the , this line , at very high conversion , which will come back in the proper time .	3.5758449212711545

So in this case we have seen , from earlier case as well , and earlier discussion as well , that at very low conversion itself , molecular weight obtained is high , and there is the time progress , more and more number polymer chains form , and , but the molecular weight remains more or less similar , which is very high .	3.1686816917249976

Now in this polymerization , chain polymerization monomers are , monomer is present throughout , but it concentration decreases gradually or steadily , and we also know that in , during this chain polymerization we have only monomer , or high molecular rate polymers .	2.962545109384367

We do not have these intermediate molecular weight oligomers , like in step growth polymerization .	3.5939673506581804

We have either monomer , or high molecular polymers , and also have you know , this initiator molecules , and solvent if we required this chain .	3.6637327363715437

In case of chain growth polymerization , our chain grows only by addition of reactive species , or the monomer at the end .	3.6075736927002686

At one end of the growing chain , if the polymer progress , then a monomer is always added at the end of the polymers , to grow the chain further .	3.631368106302719

And these chain reactions are typically have very high exotherms , and low activation energy , and if you just think little more about the , mechanism of this chain polymerization .	3.899757069423867

Now this is having a , differently having a exothermic nature , this reaction .	3.6026880013364635

And we also know that , we also can imagine that , when the monomers add on to form a high molecular rate polymers , the translational and trophy decreases .	3.471201370258387

And in normal temperature , typically the reaction temperature , it is the temperature , where we do reactions , this dominates so the reaction these chain polymerization are ; thermo dynamically feasible , in most cases are not .	3.655454142421564

This del G is less than zero , for the typical temperature , where we do reactions in the lab , which means that , most of these double bond containing monomers should polymerize given is thermo dynamic feasibility , but if you think there is the kinetic , about the kinetic factor , not every monomer not every monomer containing double bond , can be polymerized with , every type of initiator , that depends upon the structure .	2.9557377190983773

The initiator which is best , or which can polymerize a monomer , containing a double bond , will depend upon the monomer structure .	3.7458843848627397

For example , if we take a simple monomer ; say we take a very simple monomer like this , where y is a substituent .	3.9612928826456377

now the feasibility of this monomers , to undergo polymerization , chain polymerization , by a radical or cation or a anion , would depend upon the reactivity of this double bond , and also the stability of the species which formed , due to reaction of this monomer , and the reactive species , R star which we talked about in the last page , which in turns depends upon , the inactive effect and the resonance resonating effect of this substituent group y .	3.232628314280668

for example if I have ; say y as a electron withdrawing group as nitron , so if consider a molecule like this , C N .	3.4229377832299774

Now it is a electron withdrawing group , which means that , because this is present the reactivity of this double bond towards a electro file , increases , and also if there is a anionic charge here , which can be easily stabilized by the resonating effect of the nitrate group .	4.155066009689658

So if I have a anionic species , reacting with this monomer , it will form for example ; say C H 2 .	3.4789265439518853

Now it can stabilize , and from like this .	4.104440218909119

so this is , this monomer acyl nitrate , will be very much feasible , reaction of this monomer will feasible by a anionic initiators , so it can undergo chain polymerization by a anionic initiator , because you have a electron withdrawing group , which can , which actually increases the reactivity of this double bond towards electro file , and also it stabilize the reacting species which formed , because of the reaction of this monomer , with the reactive species .	3.4952438299272184

But if you have a cationic initiator for this case , and if you have a .	6.064061131312223

this was anionic initiator , if you have a cationic initiator for this case , then if it has to react , and form something like this .	3.8800967935298325

Now this will not be stabilized by this substituent ’ s .	5.275893422682863

So , these monomers , will not undergo a cationic polymerization , it will undergo anionic polymerization , now if you have a radical for example , if your radical initiator , then it will form .	4.215682565773836

Now this can also get civilized by the process of resonance , which means that this acylnitride monomer , can be polymerized by a anionic initiator , and a radical initiator , but not by a cationic initiator .	3.3002507684402675

We will take some other example .	6.322899662573935

For example we have , a monomer like this , it could be a aldehyde group .	5.500173780618865

Now when this monomers undergo anionic polymerization , it will form a species like this .	4.041307620684081

It could be any of this species , which we wrote here .	5.085313392786128

Now in this case also , this can get stabilized by resonance , and this will form this .	4.714748237683875

Similarly this can be also polymerized , for a radical polymerization , because again this , like the earlier case , this can undergo resonance and form this .	3.9144035271781368

So this type of monomer , which contain this side of , there is a carbonic carbonyl group here , they can easily undergo anionic polymerization , they can undergo radical polymerization .	3.4630268248619527

But like the earlier case they cannot , this side of monomers cannot undergo , a chain polymerization initiated by a cationic species , because then if you are a cationic group here , it will not be stabilized by resonance .	3.68402540598613

Now , if you talk about this monomer .	5.928402416433154

Now this monomer , if I polymerize with a cationic initiator , then it will be a cationic species now .	4.412638355948201

Now again this can be stabilized , by resonance , by this .	5.099138250939213

So if you have a monomer like this , then it can be polymerized , by a cationic species , anionic ; no it cannot be polymerized by , cannot be anionic species , because if you have a strong electron withdrawing group here , so anionic cannot be .	3.380788067987193

If you have a resonating group here , which is electron droning neutron pushing , so it cannot stabilize a anionic group here , even if there is a weak electron withdrawing , group of by electron effect of this , word group by in the inducting effect .	2.7913396763312637

Now if you have monomer like this , styrene .	6.751447761054028

If you have monomer like styrene , then what happened if you have a anionic case , I have other resonating structures if you have a cationic , and so as radical .	3.979852135955668

If you have a radical group , then it can also be stabilized by by this substituent group .	5.370557921912596

Now if I have a react , if I have a monomer like styrene , you can see that in each of these cases anionic , cationic , and radical , the reactive species which is forming , because of the reaction of the monomer , with the previous reactive species , can be easily stabilized by a resonation structure in all the three cases .	3.677401864346055

So styrene is example , where styrene can be polymerized other way anionic cationic , or a radical group has well as as well as radical group .	3.393254728714425

So these are the examples how the structure of monomer will determine , whether it can undergo chain polymerization by anionic species , anionic initiator , or a cationic initiator , or radical initiator , and we have seen the examples of several monomers , and let us see the table and we summarize , whatever we are just learned in first last five ten minutes .	2.7492161575464684

So if I have a simple monomer like this , if I can have y as c o r , then we know its can be polymerized by , both radical and anionic , it cannot be polymerized by cationic .	3.235113099164624

If you have a acid or ester or amide , it can also be polymerized by radical under less anionic , if you have a nitride , again it can be polymerized by radical and anionic , not by cation .	3.480697586424075

for example if you have a , it is the substitution of phenyl group , styrene , in case of styrene then it can be polymerized by all three , and if you have a another double bond hanging from the , the original double bond then also it can be stabilized , by any of these three mechanisms anionic , cationic , and radicals , which can be polymerized by all three mechanism .	3.739128242983211

We just seen that it is a ether , then it can be polymerized by cationic , it can be difficultly polymerized by radical also , but most preferred choice of polymerizing a ether group , hanging from a double bond is to use cationic polymerization .	3.266854957544354

if it is a halogen , then its halogen is having weak inducting effect electron withdrawing inactive effect , and a weak electron donating or a electron pushing resonating effect , so because both this electron donating and withdrawing , f strains are weak , so it actually does not get polymerize either by anionic or cationic , it only gets polymerized by the radical mechanism , like vinyl chloride , and for example .	2.1394264338835653

So there are other possible substitutes , which you can imagine , and depending upon the chemistry , behind it you can find out , or you can decide , whether which one to try out fast , which is the most easiest way , it can get polymerized , and if it is polymer , can be polymerized by radical that is a most easiest way of polymerizing , you know polymer process of this three .	3.2700842718078236

So we come at now , only to radical polymerization .	3.6155524031179422

Radical polymerization , we are talking about the chain polymerization , and different structure and different initiator now we , start solely on radical chain polymerization .	3.476944513199409

So what are the types , we can what are the types of monomers , can be used for radical polymerizations , monomer containing double bond between carbon atom .	3.798864331265046

the examples we have just seen ethylene styrene butadiene isoprene etcetera , and if the monomer containing electron donate withdrawing group , then it the polymer visibility of the double bond actually goes up , because the reasons we just talked about in last time fifteen minutes .	2.8858725959695253

For examples like methylmethacrylate acrylamide , vinyl chloride , acrylonitrile vinyl acetate , etcetera can be very easily polymerizable , by a radical initiator .	2.890907702067504

Now , what are the monomers it is difficult to polymerize , or cannot be polymerized at all .	4.201760728614781

If there are more substituent ’ s , both the carbonate terms in the example , we said just showed in the last pages , where you have CH 2 C H y , instead of one substitute , if you have substitution in the both the carbon , then it becomes more difficult .	2.835566119899294

For example , if you compare one butane and two butane , it is easier to polymerize one butane than two butane .	2.688244910804066

and if it is substitution is bulky , so like if you have a biphenyl ethylene , one ethyl ethylene , then it is very difficult to polymerize , and if you have tri substitute or tetra substitute , then also its very difficult to polymerize .	3.3526844386220347

And if you have disubstitution in single carbon , and unless they are not bulky , it usually works if they are very bulky , then because of the esoteric reasons they did not work and the… Now , from here if you go , move from more and more substitution , the reaction will become more and more difficult , like this is very difficult , and this two trisubstituted and tetra substituted almost never works in a radical polymerization .	3.004996292989129

So , what I mean the case of this allylic monomer .	6.416684816799978

For example the propylene , we just mentioned in the last slide .	5.438317643872941

If you have radical , then it can react with a poly propylene to form , a initiating chain initiating species , which can react with other propylene monomer , and progress the chain or propagate the polymer chain , and this can be stabilized inductively by this .	3.3701139285755186

So there should not be any problem , in that sense .	5.540240673506389

But , if you compare the other alternative , which is shown here .	3.988275550121588

If this R dot abstract a hydrogen from here , from neutral species R H , then you have this radical species generated .	3.4550406106978615

Now , which is even much stable stabiler than the previous case , because here in this case it is stabilized by resonance .	3.4693948072221055

So in most cases , this reaction , this reaction dominates than these reactions , so it ’ s this is one of the cases of transfer .	4.189132739783004

So this is for these reasons this pro propylene is difficult to polymerize by radical , and this does not happen if you have to say , monomer like methylmethacrylate , where there is no possibilities , this possibility does not arise .	3.2360733503302788

Now this can react with r star , r star can react on this carbon or this carbon , if it reacts with this carbon when it forms y , and if this reacts with this carbon , then form something like this .	2.590387239178239

Now , how does it propagate , this can react with either of these two carbon , in terms of possibilities , so if its react with this , then it forms .	4.085966188923091

If this reacts with other side , then it forms , as species like this .	3.2483654442877317

Now given this two structure , now the fact that , this monomer which is reacting with this reactant species , which means that , whether this is radical or cat ion or anion , will get stabilized , by the substitution y present .	3.1319061150100937

This reaction , this side is always preferred , unlike not this .	5.158397415947938

So approach of R to this carbon is always preferred over this carbon .	3.911952869331279

Now if you have .	11.762689941915513

So this is dominating or this almost exclusively formed , compared to this , because of the electronic stabilization of the y group .	3.537698347528629

Now this can , for the same reason , this is preferred , compared to this .	4.243196786861014

And here it is , it is the additional factor that , you have a group .	6.747846142228922

The approach of these , if it is the approach from this side , it will be even satirically hinders .	5.175500057812203

So it is approach from this carbon is , preferred , both electronically and satirically .	3.1304669218564607

So if I write this side as head , and this is tail .	4.665795865488816

Then finally , we get a polymer which has in head tail head tail arrangement .	4.537926590357988

So in chain polymerization , you have , finally when the polymer formed , you get a head tail head tail arrangement , not any of these , if , whether it is a head or tail does not matter , you can have a tail head tail head tail head arrangement as well , does not matter , but it is basically alternate , head tail head tail head tail type arrangement in the polymer structure of the monomers .	3.3162770369139825

This is because of both satirical electronic , and steri creations .	3.878708232489615

Now , we are talking about radical polymerization , and what are the different types of initiator we can use .	5.419108255481577

Now what is the source for initiator , we require a radical species to initiate the polymer chain , and we now we will look at what are the molecules which , or what are the possible ways we can generate radical , in the reaction medium .	3.8638326320910505

Now to have a radical species , to generate a radical species in the reaction medium , you should always prefer or it is very logical that , the radical should not generate at in ambient conditions , like room temperature , where you store this , your monomer or the initiator itself .	3.173274694942249

While storing it should not generate radicals , or it is the initiator molecules should not be such that , it is very difficult .	5.6425506209877705

You require very high temperature to , generate a radical form that initiator molecules , and also this , radical the initiator molecules would generate radical , in a moderate rate , so that they can be utilized in the reaction , it should not be very fast .	4.0213061204777825

If it is very fast radical generation , then the reaction will be extremely fast , and because this chain polymerization is exothermic , reaction is very fast , and you can imagine the amount of heat generated , during the reaction , which could be a hazard , it can actually explode , if it the reaction which is too high , and if is too slow then your reaction will take much longer , your radical generation is too low , then your reaction will take much longer time .	3.2373028699621935

So there are three criteria say initiators should fulfill ; one is that it should be readily available off course , specially for commercial application , it should be readily available , and it should be stable , at amnion condition if you are storing it in amnion condition at room temperature , even if you are storing in a refrigerator , it should be stable in that condition , it should not generate radical , under the condition of storage .	2.7492472288043848

And off course the third one we just talked about , that it should generate radical in a practical rate , at normal reaction temperature , it should not be too slow , for the reactions to take much longer time , or it should not be too high , then there are there are possibilities of hazard , because of a exothermic reaction happening in much faster rate .	2.7521829406082277

So , what are the initiators , we are initiated procedure , we typically use in a radical chain polymerization .	3.3939338660243945

First one is , thermal initiator , and thermal initiator is , a initiation by homolicious of a molecule , by thermal energy , leading to formation of two radicals , and the typically .	2.6377266819127985

Here we are talking about homoliticalic leaving one bond , and making two radical .	3.753728670294664

Now the bond energy should be such that , the bond should not leave at low temperature at room temperature , or it should not be very high .	3.6333967049412457

The bond innovation will not be very hicks , so that you require a , much higher temperature , to break that homiletically .	4.188012396724706

And typically if you have , this peroxides , or this s s bonds or if you have n o bonds in your molecules ; these bonds typically having bond dissociates energy of this range , so they form on hitting , and a normal , the reaction temperature they form radical , each molecule form two radicals .	2.515994979970555

For example if you consider this peroxides , could be acyl peroxide acetyl or benzyl ; for example , if I write the structure of benzylperoxide , it can break homiletically on thermal energy , on hitting to c o dot .	2.5900813580165973

Now we can have alkyl peroxides as well ; for example cumyl or t - butyl peroxides .	3.0933406493056586

Let us take example of cumyl peroxide , it can dissociate into two such radicals .	3.1607018002701897

Also this hydro peroxides ; for example t - butyl hydro peroxide , it can also undergo homiletic cleavage forming two radicals .	3.016782387736658

For example t - butyl phenyl benzoate , it can break from here , and form two different radicals .	3.4452428799327937

Now , the other main types of initiator , thermal initiator are azo compounds .	3.4542491186598987

For example 2 2 dash azo bis isobutyronitrile , which is most commonly named as , or called as A I B N , which is having this following structure .	2.7278691210227337

Plus N 2 .	27.298683044459473

Now in this case , this , the bond C N bond is not , this bond is not of the , having that bond dissociation energy , between 100 to 170 kilo joule per mol ; that ’ s the bond energy , optimal bond energy talked about .	2.330777638819633

This is actually having higher 290 kilo joule per mol , but because of this nitrogen generation , this molecule , this dissociation also becomes feasible , or very much feasible at normal reaction temperature .	2.5529349140847626

Other examples of azo compounds are , for example 4 4 dash azo bis cyanovaleric acid .	2.90383322940239

So , these are the examples , typical example of this azo compounds of this .	3.816678042142852

This compounds specifically is that it is water soluble , water soluble at p h greater than 7 , so you can use this azo compounds at acquits medium as well .	3.2957211182784656

So that it can be used for generating , or radical polymerization is acquits medium as well , whereas A I B N can be used in the radical polymerization in organic solvents , so organic medium .	3.3585386959552

The other types of this radical initiator are , like for example disulfide .	4.877219427829917

I have R S and S R , giving 2 R S dot , or I have tetrazenes , which breaking and giving 2 R N to R 2 N dot plus nitrogen , or it could be other peroxides ; for example you have potassium , it can have these peroxides as well .	2.4043443785269822

So these are the typical examples of the radical initiators .	6.369879114671026

These are the generally used radical initiator , and most common is A I B N and benzyl peroxides which are used in the lab .	3.207453755174765

Now , this radical is get generated from a initiator species , now if I want to find out how fast this radical generation happen , we can write this rate equation , which is basically dissociation constant , multiplied by the , this follows fast order kinetic , so its multiplied by initiator concentration , which will give you , this on interrogation , where I 0 is the concentration of unity initiator at t is equal to 0 , and this is some other t .	2.9574656532923997

Now if you define t half , where a time , where I is I 0 by 2 , if you define t half as the time , where the concentration of initiator has halved , then you can write t half is , can put I is I 0 by 2 , you can get this .	2.9669730316898644

So from the dissociation constant you can get the t half value , and these dissociation constant also , or the bred constant for dissociation reaction , also depend upon the temperature , where you are doing your reaction .	3.5365151847841343

For example if I look at the t half values for the some commonly used initiator .	3.7574469451311687

For example , if I take very commonly used example , like A I B N and benzyl peroxides , said B P O , benzyl peroxide , and if I write the values of t half , t half then let us have these numbers .	2.6541844690332406

So if these are the t half numbers , for commonly used initiator A I B N and B P O .	3.505310138796296

So , A I B N have t half value of at 50 degree centigrade about 74 hours , whereas 100 degree centigrade , which has a t half of 7.2 minutes ; that means if you use A I B N as the initiator , for reaction which you are carrying out at 100 degree centigrade , then your reaction is very fast , it will complete , and all the A I B N , at least half of the A I B N will consumed in 7 minutes , so your you can imagine your reaction is very fast .	2.786977052891087

Whereas if you do at 50 degree centigrade , then even its 74 hours , so almost like three days you have , half of the initiator is dissociated to form radical , so that means it is too slower reaction , if you do it at 50 degree centigrade .	3.0865010812802463

And t half value for , at 10 hours the temperature at which , t half value becomes 10 hours , its typically the most , what I say , most used temperature , where t half is 10 hours , and for that A I B N is about 60 degree centigrade and B P O is about 65 degree centigrade , but it is all depends upon how fast you want to carry out reaction , you have to choose your temperature accordingly ; for example A I B N , and if you want to use a 100 degrees , it is too faster reaction .	2.7382775800691164

So it is always recommended that you should use A I B N at this range , and B P O in this range , to have a moderate reaction rate .	2.9607186488059805

Now we have , and typical this values of kd ’ s are .	3.7574931059832255

Typical values of kd for thermal initiator is , 10 to the power minus 4 to 10 to the power minus 9 second inverse , and the usage range , where your kd is formed 10 to the power minus 2 , 10 to the power minus 6 centimeter .	3.04480598554803

The temperature where your kd is lies between these ; that is the temperature , where the reaction is typically done .	4.607686270851675

So we have now know , that what are the molecules are typically used for thermal initiation , and what are the criteria in that initiator molecule should be , and looking at the t half values at different temperature , we should choose a temperature , and a initiator combination , for a particular reaction if you want to do a reaction for a particular temperature , then if you choose a initiator molecule accordingly .	3.505574161127848

So , now let us move to other type of initiator , and next let us look for redox initiator .	3.8288767172358975

So let us look for redox initiators , and the name suggest if you have a reluctant and have a oxidants , so for example if you have a peroxide , plus a , this is oxidizing agent plus a , reducing agent .	3.127677836867909

For example , if you have a hydrogen peroxide plus farers , so it is giving to H O minus plus H O dot plus F e 3 plus .	2.809047109179398

Instead of hydrogen peroxide , you can use the other peroxides , so hydro peroxides as well , and this case you can use other ions as well .	4.173002504502049

These are the types you can use here , and you can type here , but the general reaction is same , and the reaction is much faster , and it can be done at room temperature , or even at lower temperature 0 to 5 degree centigrade , or something .	4.1026271624752875

If you want to do a reaction at low temperature for whatever reason , then this is the initiator system , you can apply and as these things are soluble in acquits medium , you can carry out the acquits radical polymerization using , redox initiator like this , or even if you want to do a , your radical polymerization in emulsions , then also this type of reactions can be initiator can be used .	3.270678229567326

The other type of redox initiator , are the example of redox initiator is , per sulfate and di amine plus di amine , again a combination of redox reducing and oxidizing agents .	2.8419984766766864

So benzyl peroxide and , say n diethyl , I mean if R is ethyl group , then it reacts and give this .	2.918856180893504

Now k d of this reaction is , at 60 degree centigrade .	5.494883937012362

Whereas , k d for B P O at 90 degree centigrade was 1.33 into 10 to the power minus 4 second inverse .	3.605242803370861

Which means that , this is much faster , this redox reaction is much faster , so generation of radical by redox initiator can be done at much lower temperature , room temperature , or even lower temperature .	3.4329748362785617

Whereas in B P O , the case of thermal initiator , the reaction rate is much lower .	5.5858863440920725

So , you need a higher temperature , for doing the polymerization reaction .	4.649686550904122

So what we will do in the next lecture , we will continue this , the other types of initiator , and including the remaining example of , the redox , the possibilities of redox initiator .	3.02236608435567

So we will come back and start in the next lecture from this redox , the other example of redox initiators .	3.3491422064495113

Welcome back to this course on Polymer Chemistry .	3.0409514610746355

In today ’ s lecture we are going to discuss about amorphous and crystalline states of polymers .	3.271350453408603

And with related to that , we will talk about the glass transition temperature and the melting point of polymers and then we will talk about the relationship between chemical structures of polymer chain and how it is effects the values of glass transition temperature and melting point .	3.978723139429813

I will brief discuss about the measurement techniques of T g and T m .	3.6269170913090676

Before we start today ' s content , let me just take two to three minutes to explain the last slide or last slide page in my previous lecture , last lecture ; because I thought that I did , because of time it was completed hurriedly .	2.1797869621031807

I just want to spend five minutes there .	4.3931945323878345

Now if , for example , what we were doing yesterday that I discussed that if I for example , have two phenol ; bisphenol in this case and now they may react with some carbonate source to make to form polycarbonate .	2.6653961819373166

Now , this example I am giving for polycarbonate , but this is , this analysis is applicable for any polymer , any copolymer specially for poly condensation copolymers ; where you have , you can find out a carbon which are signal , anymore signal dependent on the two two groups which is holding that bond .	2.9170134758953266

Now , you can have the three types of carbonate linkage .	5.315236027507286

‘ A O C O O A ’ , I just give it example here , and B O C O O B and you can have A O C O O B .	2.838275477735719

Now , this is this is similar to having B O C O O .	4.07499797959126

Now , this two are similar .	8.524239453406835

Now , in a polymer copolymer chain which will be favorable ?	6.534270479298956

Of course they depend upon the reactivity of the monomers in this A and B and obviously the feed monomer composition .	4.222336810249294

Now for example , if we assume first that the reactivity of this two monomers is same , then if I take a fifty - fifty ratio of the feed monomer composition by more person , by number , then obviously the chances of that A O H will react with another A O H to form a carbonate ; will be given by 0.5 in to 0.5 .	3.344171109449047

There , these are fifty percent of this bisphenols are this type .	3.6687463460960497

So , the chances of this type of carbonate linkage is forming 0.25 , if I have fifty - fifty ratio in the feed .	3.359304082486935

Similarly , the chances of this type of carbonate linkage is given by again 0.25 , if I have fifty - fifty ratio in the feed .	3.566223190845347

Similarly , the chances of this type of carbonate linkage is given by again 0.25 and individually these two are again 0.25 , so together they get 0.5 .	3.1211009533463545

So , obviously if I having a random polymerization where it is only dictated by the feed monomer composition , not by the reactivity of the two monomers , then a fifty - fifty feed composition will produce these three carbonate linkage .	3.0147659683639714

Similarly , if I have a , say 25 A ; A is to be 25 and 75 , then chances of forming A O C O O A will be 0.25 multiplied by 0.25 ; A O C O O B , 0.25 into 0.75 again ; twice because for the other way round and for B O C O O B will be 0.75 into 0.75 .	2.406993987123766

See , if for A this small ratio ; so if I found after the polymerization is made from our carbon that the ratio for these three carbonated is for fifty - fifty feed ratio , monomer ratio , then we will know that it is a random copolymer .	2.9131409082706696

So , the reactivities are not different .	5.677500561550039

Similarly , if we have a this ratio of these three carbonates , then we will know that this is a random arrangement .	5.589033913238416

And if the obtained signal ratio is different from any of the values , it will be suppose to for a statistical random copolymer , then we will know that block is there in the polymer .	3.422346929831994

So , this exactly has been shown by plotting in this .	3.760212317576477

So , if you change the feed ratio , what will be the ratio ?	4.783175283314051

This is for A A and this is for B B , this is for A A .	5.220109628677739

So , this A for carbonate or any other… polymer ; this is for B B and this is for A B A B linkages .	4.441935899792992

This is the plot of monomer mole fraction verses feed mole ratio .	3.1886230365375554

Ok . Now , let us come back to today ’ s topic of lecture about amorphous and crystalline state .	3.419498868912507

Till now what we have done ?	7.71566034694407

We have already made the polymer .	5.317771981587909

We know how to make the polymer from our understanding of polymer synthesis and then we know that how it behaves in solution .	4.770045187299563

And with that knowledge , we were able to find out the chemical composition of the polymer .	4.635362248281388

And if it is a copolymer what is the composition , what is the , what is the sequence of monomer present in the monomer in the polymer and we know what is the molecular weight of the polymer .	6.438399638240192

So , we know all the basically what are the information needed for the polymer .	4.436734677008625

We know by this time .	6.6686497363057775

So , what is what we will do this ?	7.482651443106752

Obviously , we want to use this polymer for some applications .	5.5325847999750115

And , I have discussed in the very beginning that polymers are utilized in mainly two O H bonds .	3.225819730177951

Secondly , which is almost the majority of the application of polymeric material or polymers is where the polymer is the main component .	4.304230409243329

It is almost close to hundred percent polymers and you have the additives or fillers , which basically are the property enhancer or stabilizers or color and dye .	2.9054202313979296

Those are the added components .	6.4715889527477986

So , mainly it is the polymer .	9.468732005439442

So what , how do you make those polymers like if you feel disc , if you want to make a CD or DVD out of a polymeric material ?	3.2781434807235534

We have synthesized the polymer and characterized ; now we have to give or you to make a polymer in a different shape , which is the shape of the final applications of that polymers .	4.583644061727557

So , for that we must know the behavior of a polymer in solid state .	5.06918542337858

Solid state in the sense , where the polymer is applied in room temperature , it is not viscous .	5.736711158031281

What it is not a as we will discuss that “solid state ” may not be the thermodynamically correct terminology in case of Polymer Science .	4.622564215456238

What solid by state , I mean that it is not flowing in the condition where we are using .	4.4431037446077095

So in polymers , polymers in that solid state can be mostly in two types .	3.3941142406228306

Where , they can be semi - crystalline ; Semi - crystalline , when it has this crystalline regions and which are basically ordered .	3.8563895179495904

And amorphous region , where amorphous material , where there is no order .	4.625786619255164

We all know what is a crystal ?	7.519027553842267

And we know crystalline solid , liquid and gaseous state of matters ; three state of matters .	2.681825046456847

Where in case of crystalline state , solid state , we have long - range order ; in case of liquid state we have short - range order and in gaseous state we do not have any order .	3.310390908283115

And , we have sub - temperature or sub - temperature conditions , where these two transitions takes place from gas to liquid state at volume point and from a liquid to solid state as a freezing point .	2.1295619691475887

So , you know that there are three states possible for a matter .	4.6059871353066635

In case of polymers , this solid state is not actually a proper .	3.7417741873215062

in true sense , solid states because in most cases , either it is fully amorphous , no long - range order is present and in second case they could be partly crystalline ; partly , there could be long range order exists and partly there will be no order .	2.8157861434056746

So , it is a combination of amorphous and crystalline region .	4.699070293486795

So , we call this as a semi crystalline state .	6.11497626499779

It is not practically possible to get purely hundred percent crystalline polymer , because of your size is mainly because of size or large molecular weight .	2.6169203918471213

So , we mostly delete semi - crystalline polymer , which is basically partly crystalline and partly amorphous .	4.127186155544096

And amorphous , which is hundred percent amorphous , zero percent crystalline region .	3.0619686771594115

Now , what happened if we take water and cool it down ?	3.4269425879942172

Say , for example , this one , case one ; if we take a water vapor and then the water , just consider water , liquid water and then cool it down .	3.10889192903082

The specific volume will go down .	6.131414868125969

It will happen for most of the basis .	6.433527893314199

There could be some disturbance for water , but I am talking about in general any liquid .	3.240762372178595

Just consider a general liquid ; with decrease in the temperature , the specific volume will decrease and at a particular temperature freezing point , the specific temperature will go a discontinuity and then it will form a crystalline state .	3.280865726837495

And again , the specific volume will decrease with the decrease in temperature , but in a much slower rate than it was in case of liquid state .	3.4204994287116155

See , if I have a polymer melt I have a polymer melt polymer melt , obviously there are many changes .	4.76992562943126

I am drawing few changes here with different inks .	3.7387730049470504

Trying to draw polymer chains having different with different inks .	3.556913966557239

Just imagine , these three are the different polymer chains in melt , then tangled .	4.359894215838093

They have thermal motions ; they have kinetic energy associated with them .	3.0682536313278996

Now , if you cool this or reduce the temperature of this polymer melt , obviously this viscosity goes up and the polymers start flowing less .	3.9287649923232983

Now if you further cool down , what happened ?	4.016168372091286

In case of a small molecular liquid , they would have a certain temperature in freezing point or melting point , they would have arranged or form a crystal with long range order .	2.8099298274183444

But in case of polymers , when you are cooling these trans , these polymer chains do not have enough space or they do not have enough time to sort of arrange themselves and align themselves , so that they make a crystal .	3.23982268343755

So , to have a crystal , say for example , if I want to make a crystal , either these polymer chains should arrange in order or they can , a single polymer chain can fold like this and can make a order .	3.863929618908054

So , basically if you are talking about two , three polymers , they can form like different crystalline states .	3.584527761072199

So , what I am trying to explain ?	4.8291493621869455

That when you cool a polymer melt , it is not possible for the entire polymer must , to crystallize mainly because of there is not enough space or you are not giving enough time to the polymer chains to arrange or align themselves in a crystalline manner or maybe the polymer chemical structures do not allow them to align in a regular manner .	2.702079924375431

So , if it does not crystallize at melting point and you keep on decreasing the temperature , what will happen ?	3.3984686726112643

The viscosity will further decrease .	6.492123657683259

And one point of time , the mobility , the thermal energy of this polymer chains will not be sufficient to have any mobility , any long range mobility of the polymer chain .	3.5254884123652843

So , the polymer chain will become like a glass .	6.278501018075425

So , if you cool a polymer sample , they can crystallize partly in this temperature or if they do not crystallize at all and if further reduced , then they can undergo , the viscosity can go up , they can become a rubbery material .	2.8708177607019425

And with further drop in temperature , their mobility becomes effectively very low and they become a glassy state .	2.6574862336150624

So , this temperature where you have a conversion or transformation of the rubbery state ; transition from a rubbery state to glassy state , this is not a particular temperature , but a particular range of temperature ; this is called glass transition temperature .	3.292738843414133

And the temperature at which the polymer melting happens , that is the melting temperature of a polymer .	5.193522722154683

So , a polymer can have amorphous material .	5.75934349693656

Now , we are talking about heating .	7.665520117926656

What happened in case of a polymer material ?	9.11991759159498

For a amorphous polymer , if we heat from a lower temperature region , the volume expand at the constant rate .	3.007543578918078

And at glass transition temperature , rate of expansion increases abruptly .	4.609642448001552

And as the result of this chain mobilities , a bunch of physical behavior or the mechanical , a property of this polymeric material changes , it becomes hard material , to a hard glassy materials to a soft rubbery material .	2.420584619406716

And if you continue heating , some point of time this rubbery material become like a viscous liquid .	3.0523148687102184

So , changes at T g are less drastic , since the changes are restricted to amorphous regions only , where the crystalline regions are unaffected .	2.747884664363393

So , between T g and T m the semi crystalline polymer is composed of rigid crystallites ; like rigid crystallites which are composed , which are dispersed in a rubbery amorphous matrix .	2.447410322636978

And at T m where the crystallite melts , which leads to a viscous state .	3.2457696665041444

So , if I want to define a glass transition temperature , that it is a temperature at which the glassy state is changed into the rubbery state .	3.77346136774016

What is the glassy state ?	6.669708725468831

It is basically , we know this ; the slide glass is hard rigid material , which have only a short - range vibrational and rotational motion of the atoms which is a hard , rigid and the brittle material .	2.928357557135598

And the rubbery state is basically having a long - range rotational motion of polymer segments and it is a soft and flexible .	3.478149976323235

So , at T g what are the transition takes place at in terms of molecular and if you think about polymer molecules , the intermolecular Van Der Waals forces they breakdown .	3.3875220662923153

And this is the temperature on set of large scale molecular motions .	4.335688328755158

And we know that it undergoes glass to rubbery behaviour change .	3.6613378185389642

And that is , for amorphous polymer , obviously that should be highest temperature of usage because after that , the polymer becomes so soft that it cannot be useful .	2.8766818085125077

And the nature of polymer crystalline in the semi crystal material depends on how fast your cooling , what is the condition of you that the crystallization generalization .	3.365851688016884

So , the crystallization size , the crystallites , the crystalline dimension of the shape of the crystalline regions , as well as the fraction of the inter material which are crystallize ; they all depends on several factors .	3.0891682011559825

So finally , whatever crystalline material we have , that is non - equilibrium microstructures .	3.1878549647965464

And in case of semi crystalline material , there is existence , coexistence in amorphous and crystalline region .	3.173342570530936

And this is the micro structure actually determines the material property .	4.873016428762995

We obviously can do it by cooling the molten polymer .	4.048842250167655

When we evaporate a polymer solution , then the polymer chains can align themselves up because evaporation is a slow step , slow process.. ... polymer chains in the solution have more time to align themselves .	2.921018359114544

So , they can form crystalline regions .	5.92150539142695

Annealing ; annealing is nothing but heating a polymer at particular temperature .	4.1115585977497275

And basically what we get when we heat the polymers ?	3.9686600669663856

At a certain temperature , we are providing some thermal energy .	4.289115844428967

With the help of that , the polymer chains can slowly align themselves and form crystalline regions .	4.250338804527178

And another way , we can induce crystallinity in a polymer material by drawing .	4.490148659472871

When a stretch , like stretch a amorphous polymers , then the amorphous polymer align just because it is between stretching the polymer .	2.769111031906393

We the chains can come closer and direct ; align themselves in a particular direction which basically induces crystallinity .	2.9839457471075606

So , these are the example how we can… these are the different ways we can induce polymer crystallinity .	4.198236692398358

And as this emphasizes the fact that the final crystallinity in the polymer with… extend and the nature will depend upon several processes .	3.5018174274849034

So , final state is a non - equilibrium state .	5.157388407759066

There are different models available for polymer crystallinity .	4.0888154819403795

This is fringed micelle model , which is like these crystalline domains are micelle like structures .	2.643088525833887

So , and this crystalline regions are formed by different polymer chains .	4.441998706789252

And also , one single chain can be part of different crystalline regions .	3.788264461111975

So , crystalline regions are embedded with or embedded in these amorphous regions , which are not crystalline .	3.2234983734582277

The other models it can form ; just like I was explaining it can form folded chains and align themselves to form high crystalline material .	2.591667234957194

And there are different models available like regular adjacent folds , irregular adjacent folds and nonadjacent switchbacks .	2.4656531894196636

And , other module of polymer crystallines is Spherulite ; where these polymer crystallites are arranged in this manner .	2.6048042919929757

As the Polymer Chemistry may not be very much interested in this that the morphology of the crystalline polymers , but we to understand the polymer properties and the structure properties relation , we must know the crystalline behaviour and different types of models in polymer material .	3.1076232876344063

Now , how if the crystalline polymers is different than amorphous polymer ?	4.046755757476432

As you can understand that crystalline regions , semi - crystalline polymers will have crystalline regions of high stiff regions which basically gives you higher rigidity , but lower impact strength ; obviously , you can imagine from the structure that it will give higher density .	2.7697144799671642

Crystalline polymers or semi - crystalline polymer give you a higher density to amorphous polymers .	4.386210142078728

Because of the presence of the crystalline regions , it gives resistance , higher solvent or chemical resistant .	3.6486389282644733

Obviously , this because of the presence of crystallites , catalyte and invariably we get translucent to opaque material .	3.6130744428809582

Presence of crystallites helps in reducing the permeability of different gases .	3.701666358084814

The crystalline polymeric material gives high heat capabilities because of the reinforcement made by the crystalline regions .	3.355316967041709

And some other properties like anisotropic and all good electrical properties you can get as a result of crystalline regions .	3.645728623071578

This is not all desired .	6.254188784568114

It should not have a perspective that all crystalline polymers are semi - crystalline polymers… better properties than amorphous polymers .	3.0965900446232153

They have some better properties , but in a cost of something else .	3.3774771768401215

Like it always comes , it always becomes opaque or translucent .	3.2023703230385765

If you want to have applications where you need where you need a transparent polymeric material , then it is very difficult to do with a crystalline polymers .	3.5432412199804406

You always stand up for choosing amorphous material .	3.77689340687103

So , there is always a balance between what you need for the final applications .	3.686957677278199

Now , let us talk about the thermodynamics of this glass transition temperature and the melting point in brief .	3.601085501349642

Now in Thermodynamics , we can have two types of transition ; first order phase transition and second order phase transition .	3.198274647722101

Now , from our thermo dynamical knowledge we can write these expressions .	4.486578394727266

Now , in first order transitions what happened ?	5.29040137581069

If we plot G verses any of the straight parameters like temperature , pressure , volume , then it changes continuously .	2.8158107234036853

This is a continuous change of free energy with the state parameters like pressure , temperature , volume .	2.899669137947001

Whereas if we plot any of the first derivative of the Gibbs energy function like V or H or S with any of this parameter , then we are we get a discontinuity in this plot .	3.404000279531222

So , basically first order transitions gives continuity in G verses T , P , V plot , whereas the first derivative of G is discontinuous when we plot against these state parameters .	2.188124608618397

Whereas in second order transition ; in case of second order transition both of these are continuous functions , but the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy function G is varies with these parameters discontinuously .	2.7349560532938555

For example , if I consider a H and then plot a H verses say T , we will have the discontinuity in the in this variation of a H with temperature .	2.725115348119043

So , basically what does it mean ?	4.936421121411289

It mean that the first order transitions which , in case of first order transitions like melting where G is a linear function of basically it varies with temperature , pressure and volume continuously .	3.2337351358536233

And the first derivative will vary discontinuously , whereas in case of second order transition , the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy function varies discontinuously .	2.994863609788067

Whereas in T g , the glass transition temperature which varies discontinuity with the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy function .	3.346661054634525

Let C p and so C , this is to be C p ; C p verses T would be discontinuous function because this is the second derivative of G and these are the first derivative of G .	3.2884569576608955

So it , does it mean that we know that T m from this curves we know that glass transition melting temperature is a melting is a first order transition , thermodynamic first order transition , but whether does this mean that glass transition is a second order transitions thermodynamically ?	3.0226906884414526

The answer is no because the fact that the glass transition temperature depends upon also the rate at which we cool the polymer matrix or polymer melt .	3.1547613875355305

If you cool fast , then T g will be higher ; if we give more time , the polymer chains to arrange themself and give more time , which means cool slowly , then T g will be lower ; which means is that , these curves will look like same , but this temperature glass transition temperature will vary , if we change the cooling rate or incase of reverse direction heating rate .	2.5819057694887464

So , this is not a… Hence this is not a true second order thermodynamic transition , but for a particular heating rate the phase transition between the glassy state , and the rubbery state is resembles with a second order thermodynamics transition .	2.8557876380715386

Now , what are the factors from a Polymer Chemistry point of view ?	3.6375082783169246

In , especially in Polymer Chemistry course , we must know what are the factors that responsible or that affects the value of T g .	3.7940378373828865

So , we can design the polymers of certain structure , certain chemical structure to get a desired value of T g .	3.2133337357306653

Now , the main factors : the T g depends on the free volume .	5.753415790432105

Free volume is the volume occupied by not occupied by the polymer .	4.893016204823623

If you are talking about polymer melt , it is the volume which is not occupied or the way the polymer chains .	4.827704821379968

So , if you consider just a liquid , then there will be lots of you know , then there will be lots of intermolecular spaces which are not occupied by the molecules ; that those are free volumes .	3.4220755982944455

And if you increase the temperature typically , if the free volume increases , the polymer becomes lesser than or the materials becomes less dense .	3.0955710287900224

So , free volume of a polymer material depends on molecular weight , presence of plasticizers or plasticizing side group cross linking .	3.2266775337391658

We will discuss this , effect of this little detailed with examples .	3.7205883927484256

Another very important factor which determine the value of T g is the mobility to rotate or the mobility of the polymer chains .	3.5909112708799227

If the polymer for example , if it is very stiff , the rotation between the single bond , around the single bond is restricted , then the mobility of the polymers comes down .	4.014814246617155

So if that happens , then the polymer chain have much less mobility compared to a much flexible chain .	4.330652805140266

So , basically the degrees of freedom for internal rotation or the mobility of the chain effect the value of T g .	3.5515972774026823

And this rotation or the mobility of the polymer chain depends upon the stiffness of the backbone or the flexibility of the backbone , steric effect , side group , which is basically governed by the side group present and inter molecular forces ; the more intermolecular forces , the less is the freedom to move .	2.833875678792829

So , what I will do ?	5.422443188816503

I will take these factors one by one and give examples ; few real examples to emphasize or convince you or the how this factors effects the T g of a polymer material or a polymer .	3.0207403866708185

Now , we must remember that it is very difficult to change only one of these parameters , just only one parameter ; because changing one parameter , these are all interlinked sometime .	3.4243954139743833

So , they may changing one parameter may also change the effect on the other parameter .	3.9226475888956363

So , it is very difficult always to attribute one change in value of glass transition temperature , T g for a particular reason .	3.2550398659843247

But , at least we can estimate , we can find out the direction that , if we do certain changes of a certain polymer structure of what the expected change in the glass transition should be .	3.2374746819456255

So , let us first talk about the chain backbone stiffness .	4.871699011952739

So , let us first talk about the effect of polar groups .	5.070862520003423

Consider this iso poly isoprene and poly chloroprene ; this is chloroprene and this is isoprene .	3.4822670132872284

This has the T g 73 minus 73 degree centigrade and this is minus 20 degree centigrade .	6.4556553525514495

Compare another set of polymer polystyrene four poly four vinyl chlorobenzene , the values for the T g are given by 100 degree centigrade , 110 and 142 .	3.842202338427151

This is one set ; this is second set .	3.9294963416142115

Let us compare another set ; polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride .	3.3390459551693463

This is around 10 degree ; this is only around 87 degree .	4.4192365482115346

So , for example , here the effect of this chlorine and methyl group on the rotation , basically if the steric effect caused by this two or more similar .	3.488857981175946

So , any change in these T g values are because of the most likely because of the interaction between the intermolecular forces between the two chains .	4.508227306839821

This is having more , more polar , the intermolecular forces between the polyvinyl chloride chains are much higher compared to polypropylene chains .	3.065914557828634

So , the T g goes up .	6.073503143933872

Similarly , you can get the other side of examples .	7.7456475160560085

Same here the more polar , the more intermolecular forces and more higher T g .	3.2383301090871077

So , which means if we increase the polarity of the bonds , more will be the intermolecular attraction ; T g will go up .	3.8390810400945674

Let us compare example of polydimethylsiloxane or P D M S .	2.9538481216456787

This is having T g of minus 120 , polyethylene minus 80 and say it is a much rigid backbone ; polypropylene oxide P P O , 200 degree centigrade .	3.1220527049966673

Let us compare another set of polyamides ; same class of polymers .	3.3432388910596194

Polyamide ; nylon 3 , T g is 110 to 200 degree centigrade .	5.708844341784187

Similarly we can write , we can know what is the… this is the number of… carbon atom which gives this number ; so 3 carbon atom ; nylon 3 .	4.6649408471053695

So , similarly we can write nylon 6 , nylon 11 , which gives T g of 52 degree centigrade , 42 degree centigrade and one very rigid polyamide , polybenzamide , T g is 500 degree centigrade .	3.3292892614459033

And , another set of example is the polyester .	5.7276274470724475

The T g is minus 63 degree , whereas if I replace this with a rigid phenyl backbone keeping everything else same , then the T g goes up .	2.5410939814530673

Now , look at these three set of example .	4.948843830130837

We can clearly see .	9.580368935440273

Here , we only change this ( C H 2 ) 4 backbone with a much stiffer backbone , which basically restrict the rotational freedom around this chain , which makes the polymer backbone much stiffer .	2.617627073385479

And hence , the T g goes up .	4.961476634858653

Similarly , the example here ; these two are stiff components .	4.472955464936278

So , more C H 2 groups we put in between the polymer chains , more flexible or less stiff .	3.9376581909486177

So T g comes down , whereas again if we instead of a normal alkene chain in between , if you have a rigid… groups which is basically restrict rotation around single bonds , the T g drastically goes up .	3.0186977199554224

Similarly , silicon oxygen bond is a very flexible bond .	5.76110759921392

So , T g is very low ; minus 120 degree .	7.295982944745084

There is no side group present , which basically does not restrict at all the rotation around the single bond which polyethylene chain is very flexible .	2.8251503344595683

And T g is minus 80 , whereas putting rigid group in the backbone makes the polymer very stiff , which keeps the T g very high .	3.4215827740882983

So , basically again if the backbone of the polymer chain increases , the stiffness of the backbone of the polymer chain increases or the T g goes up or the flexibility increases , the T g comes down .	3.714897344587137

Let us now discuss the effect of steric effect .	5.8907915647276505

Basically , steric effect or let me write steric effect of side groups .	3.7986404947021906

So , if you just compare a simple example of polyethylene , C H 2 C H 3 polypropylene , polystyrene and four vinyl anthrosin .	2.922713110214749

Obviously , if you look at these structures , the rotation because of the substitute present , the bulky substituent present as a carbonate term , the rotation becomes more and more with the increase in the size of this substituent .	3.3828922064023406

Now , we can always argue that with the increase in the size ; most likely when there was interaction between the chains , also increases which causes increase in intermolecular forces .	2.984306075084875

That may be also true , so that continuity in some extent of this cause of increase in T g with more bulky group .	2.7684288184272123

But , most likely the increase is in T g .	4.5762451895248795

The increase in T g , which increase in size of the side groups is mainly because of the restriction of the rotation .	4.1418468056625874

So , the polymer because of the increase in the size , the polymer chain goes , the polymer stiffness goes up and hence the T g goes up .	4.445750166485588

So , which means that if we have bulky side groups , the polymer chains becomes more stiff .	5.249118281798991

The as a result , the T g goes up .	5.912910895321923

Molecular weight of a polymer chain also contribute in the value of T g , but it effect the molecular weight actually dies down after some molecular weight .	4.023923446524259

So , basically with increase in the molecular weight , the T g goes up to certain point .	5.487766350413542

And then basically the value of T g becomes independent of molecular weight .	4.873582842375882

It can be explained for the fact that the chain ends , for the polymer chain the ends are more mobile , more flexible because in case , the one of the sides it is not tied up from both sides , whereas some , any segments in between they are tied up by both the sides .	3.0905062072467056

So , ends are more mobile and have more free volume and hence they has they have more free volume .	2.857735214919364

And if you increase the free volume , polymer has more space to basically more space to chain with contribution and it becomes more mobile and the T g goes down .	2.9424303789085435

So for a chain , the more is the contribution from ends , the more is the free volume ; hence the T g is slower .	3.866614297260353

So , for shorter molecular weight the contribution from chain , hence the significant , hence the T g is low .	3.5710200968334704

And with increasing the chain length , the molecular weight , the contribution from the ends goes down progressively .	4.025442659399819

And after a certain molecular weight , the chain , hence do not contribute too much .	3.9476898307471835

So , the value of T g becomes steady value .	4.564848422230248

Generally , we compare in for polymer application .	5.0726284767368135

We take molecules use or use polymers having molecular weight much above than these , so for practical purposes at the practical range of molecular weight , which usually used for applications of polymers .	2.728119622994231

Next , talk about the effect of plasticizing side groups .	6.890778053812631

Let us take particular example of methyl methacrylate .	4.092773549070471

So , let us talk about example of methyl methacrylate .	4.1373629177464535

If R C H 3 which is methyl methacrylate and T g is around 105 ; if we ethyl is 65 ; n - propyl 38 ; n - butyl minus 2 ; n - octyl minus 42 ; n - lauryl minus 62 degree centigrade .	2.4103469160635713

So , look if we , if you further apart from the backbone , they keep on increasing the chain length .	3.3286980461662754

What happens ?	24.472237158732387

With a further increase in the chain polymer side chain , they do not contribute too much in the restriction of the bond rotation ; whatever restriction have been imposed in the bond rotation , they have done by first few atoms .	2.8907500634069816

So , if you put further substitution , reaction do not contribute much in the terms of a restriction in bond rotation .	3.0593064559210124

But because of their mobility , the side chains , they generate lots of free volume and hence the entire polymer chain becomes more mobile .	3.4665593964949384

So , if the side chain molecular weight goes up or size goes up , the T g grows some .	4.075178907207442

This is nothing but sort of plasticizing effect .	4.534870270201395

As if these molecules are dissolved in the polymer of this .	6.220523896709922

But if we compare , like compare n - propyl substitution with isopropyl substitution , then the T g goes up little bit ; 38 to 50 degree centigrade .	2.6557527046927456

Compare n - butyl with isobutyl and tertiary butyl substitution ; this is 29 and tertiary butyl is 64 degree centigrade .	2.8704118663693032

Whereas this n - butyl is minus 2 ; isobutyl is 29 ; tertiary butyl is 64 degree centigrade .	2.888032517820171

So , look here because now this , when you have this isobutyl and tertiary butyl group , they are becoming bulky in this way and whereas n - propyl groups , they are becoming bulk or increasing size .	2.7612670464178453

So , the free volume because of this long chain is much more compared to the free volume produced by bulky groups having a spherical type shape or coil type shape .	3.3348421260379846

So , they give actually less free volume to the polymer chain and also they may contribute little bit about the restriction chain rotation .	3.1839444757080213

So , they actually increase in the polymer , increasing the restriction .	6.376042278827223

So , next talk about the plasticizing , the plasticizer .	6.087893020721651

Plasticizers are nothing but small molecules which basically dissolve in the polymer matrices and like the solvent or some added molecules .	3.708444710010804

If some residue on solvents present in the polymer matrix , then what happened ?	4.629705483215097

Because of the solvent molecules or small molecules or the free molecules , the solvent goes up .	4.394066110165327

And hence , the polymer mobility goes up and T g also goes down .	4.017572594445197

So , presence of plasticizer makes the polymer T g comes down .	3.463010983515929

There are few other factors which affect T g which does not have any generalization .	3.7997899012889773

I just quickly go through that .	6.421980159284765

For example , if I have compare two symmetric substitution like two substitutes , a F verses 1 and substitutes a F ; the unsymmetrical have the higher T g .	2.0754251587569166

This is the two example .	7.102779587308668

And now the Cis - trans isomer of diene polymer , they have different T g s .	2.67177322525171

Now , these are all specific examples .	6.636645147137385

No generalization can be possible .	7.279263120093802

So explanation , general explanation is little difficult to give .	3.7987978917889844

And if the glass transition temperature also depend on the T g , sorry , tacticity of the homopolymers , and for example if you look at the T g of syndiotactic of poly methyl methacrylate is different than isotactic , whereas copolystyrene is not different .	3.4161573408963184

So , what I will do , I will stop today and we will start in the next lecture .	3.359266506872271

Continuing with the methods for immobilization of enzymes , we shall be talking today about the entrapment methods .	3.291988568186451

So far we have discussed various methods under the category of adsorption including ionic binding and metal salt linkage , cross linking and covalent bond formation .	2.652204418832669

That means the enzyme molecules are entrapped within a definite region of a space ; it could be a lattice of a polymeric matrix or a semi permeable membrane .	3.2027961029609964

This matrix within which the enzyme is entrapped must be tight enough to prevent the release of the protein and allow the substrate or product molecule to pass through the boundaries .	3.3005033464075075

It means that when we have an enzyme which is entrapped within a gel matrix the gel should be porous enough so that within the pores it can retain the enzyme molecules which are large molecular weight in size of that of a protein but the porous structure must be such that the small molecular weight substrate or product molecules are allowed to pass through and therefore the reaction can be carried out .	3.406479267770943

On the other hand if the entrapped preparation is like a micro capsule which also consist of a semi permeable membrane boundary the permeability of the membrane must be such that the enzyme molecules are not allowed to be leaked out while the substrate and the product molecule can pass through easily .	2.766459557452813

Some of the important characteristics of these preparations is that only reactions involving relatively small substrate or product molecules can be carried out successfully using entrapped enzyme preparations .	2.8216284273970866

Because the enzyme is entrapped it does not have any interactions or modifications or involvement or coupling of the amino acid residues of the protein molecules with that of the matrix of the immobilize enzyme preparation and therefore the sole force that keeps the enzyme molecules bound to the matrix is the porous network and purely by molecular size .	3.3419928162704506

Therefore only small molecular weight substrate and products can be processed while the large molecular weight substrate or products cannot be processed using entrapped immobilized enzyme preparations .	2.8508720517966264

The major advantage of this method is that it does not require any modification or involvements of the amino acids residues of the enzyme which results in the high yield and stability because there is no modification of the enzyme structure involved in the entrapment methods .	4.11234004616598

It is purely a physical restriction constraint of the enzyme molecule within a narrow region of a space and therefore the enzyme does not undergo any deactivation and usually the yields obtained by the method are quite high .	2.7466536588645045

Second thing is that the micro environment of the enzyme can also be tailored to suite its stability .	5.279047236928597

While immobilizing the preparation , one can add substrate molecules or other stabilizing agents so that they are retained along with the enzymes and stable preparations can be obtained .	3.119558386101543

Two major types of entrapments methods that have been extensively followed are by gel entrapment .	3.1266112863599407

That means you have a polymeric gel matrix and an enzyme molecule is entrapped within the lattices or interstitial spaces of these gel just by physical confinement .	3.1346129230949327

There are varieties of methods to make the gel network .	4.321050171351168

We will discuss that and on the other hand the second method is microencapsulation where you tend to form a kind of a artificial cell with its boundary of a semi permeable membrane and the enzyme molecules are entrapped within this membrane and these micro capsules can be used as the immobilized enzyme preparations .	2.9858722376794895

Looking at the first method that is the gel entrapment it involves entrapping the enzyme within the interstitial spaces of cross linked water soluble polymeric gels .	2.9393484319301653

Look at some of the phrases which I mentioned ; cross linked water insoluble polymeric gels .	3.573127146427884

In most cases we start either with the monomer or a water soluble polymer .	4.6538287517249035

We start with a monomer unit and only those cases where the polymerization can be carried out under mild reaction conditions in the presence of enzyme .	3.9992346170768514

The monomer solution which is usually water soluble is mixed with the enzyme solution and conditions are created so that polymerization can take place under mild reaction conditions with the help of a catalyst or initiator or some other conditions and the network of polymeric gel is formed which is water insoluble and then the enzyme is entrapped within the interstitial spaces .	3.0274582023558967

Therefore it could be either by change of solvent , it could be change of by certain ions , it could be by temperature ; the usual parameters which can induce insolubility or it can affect the solubility of the polymer .	3.3421835930589614

The polymeric network can be obtained from monomers , oligomers or polymeric precursors by changing the solubility variables .	2.9534265615648576

So there are two approaches by which these preparations are made by changing the solubility variables like solvent , temperature , pH and ionic strength or the cross linking reactions .	2.7861828427329693

If it is a water soluble polymer , one can also induce cross linking by certain conditions so that it becomes water insoluble and the enzyme gets trapped into the matrix .	3.551069000858554

The purpose is if we start with water soluble polymer it will usually not have any cross linking .	3.6479945600434602

It will be water soluble with lot of hydrophilic groups and the enzyme can easily mix with the solution .	3.590028159592295

Once you induce cross linking into it by any method , it could be by a cross linking bifunctional reagent like butyraldehyde , it could be ferric chloride .	3.169379653260184

Variety of methods has been employed and after cross linking is induced the whole network becomes water insoluble and the enzyme molecules are entrapped .	2.8109315140102344

On the other hand when we are starting with a monomer unit which is water soluble , then to get water insoluble gel you include a cross linking agent .	3.118838821060277

These two parameters are in …. .. .	7.227908594444308

One is the degree of cross linking and the other is to change the solubility parameter .	4.839644880364375

The ultimate matrix must be insoluble in water and also it should be in a proper range of cross linking such that the porosity can be regulated .	3.4534694434372954

Cross linking helps in a very significant manner to control the porosity of the matrix ; higher the cross linking smaller is the porosity .	3.8095569929594957

One of the most commonly used methods is the poly acrylamide gel entrapment .	3.6469501710462797

More than 50 % of the total literature cited on entrapment methods would probably be devoted to polyacrylamide gel entrapment .	2.668527528705633

It was one of the earliest methods also because the poly acrylamide gel preparation was an existing methodology even for gel electrophoresis .	2.9072880497010183

So we will use the same method to prepare an enzyme containing gels .	3.66662990913198

The method is very simple .	6.254031512579377

We start with an acrylamide monomer which is water soluble .	4.873587078680379

To this a cross linking reagent usually N , N - methylene bisacrylamide usually often called as BIS is added and an enzyme solution is mixed with it .	2.929308794303916

The three water soluble materials are mixed to which an initiator is added .	3.0460790493106824

It could be ammonium persulphate or potassium per sulphate or riboflavin .	2.745311064491348

They are initiators ; that means it is a free radical polymerization .	5.541390169126708

So you need an initiator molecule which can initiate the free radical reaction and TEMED , N , N , N ’ , N ’ tetra methyl ethylene diamine is used as the catalyst .	3.004617574751023

The two parameters which are very important to control here is the absence of oxygen .	5.317487645285004

So it is very important that all the reagents that have been used are free of oxygen .	4.797290214774325

If you bubble nitrogen through the reagents you can get them free of oxygen .	3.4142956279348717

But even traces of oxygen can reduce degree of polymerization in the polymerization reaction .	4.442004574246744

The second parameter is that the reaction must be carried out at less then ten degree centigrade .	4.4617388552907755

The reaction temperature while it will control the reaction rate it will carry out the reaction at a slow rate and it has also been seen in the polymerization reaction that slower the rate degree of the polymerization can be taken up to a higher level .	3.807402519090305

Secondly it is also important to keep the enzyme in a good state that is not to allow inactivation of the enzyme .	4.5354745491024255

The reaction is exothermic and lot of heat is generated .	4.198298069239961

So you have to make arrangement for dissipation of heat so that the temperature can be maintained at less than ten degree centigrade and the enzyme is not deactivated .	3.4249831091113294

It ’ s a very fast reaction .	7.277373354869805

The whole reaction will be over in a couple of minutes .	4.772356952672395

In a couple of minutes you get a polymeric network of chains .	4.7576611226027765

It ’ s a three dimensional network .	6.181985022342682

These are the chains which are shown in the dotted lines and indicate the cross linkages which are vertical to the plane of the paper So the three dimensional network is formed and enzyme molecules are entrapped within the interstitial spaces which are created by the cross linkages that are maintained and you get a smooth solid block in the form of a gel .	2.531821534018649

The porosity of the gel can be maintained by the concentration of the cross linking agent that is BIS .	3.678000136091672

Temperature also can control the degree of polymerization and all the parameters can be optimized for a given condition so that the maximum yield of the enzyme activity is recovered at the end of the reaction .	4.397469710140131

You end up in a three dimensional network which is water insoluble and in the form of a block .	4.8889822113435075

Here some of the cross linkages are shown ending with the dots .	4.80892490645278

These ones are perpendicular to the plane of paper to indicate a three dimensional network and the enzyme being entrapped within the space .	3.10981234373348

The conditions of concentration of the acrylamide monomer , the concentration of the cross linking agent , that is BIS , the reaction temperature are the three major parameters which control the degree of polymerization and porosity of the gel .	3.634107555506936

After the gel is formed , the gel is mechanically ruptured into small pieces in the form of a small granules or cut into small pieces and then can be used as a packing material in the reactors .	2.9584812239225258

In addition to this another very common group of methods which has been used are the use of photocrosslinkable reagent prepolymers .	3.4996306761870377

A large number of methods are based on the use of photocrosslinkable prepolymers .	5.151444524028465

I have shown here some of the reagents like ENT which is water soluble derivative of poly ethylene glycol , ENTP is a water insoluble derivative of polypropylene glycol and ENTB is a water insoluble derivative of polybutadiene .	2.704853648488111

PBM is malic polybutadiene and PU is polyurethane and these are the precursors of certain photocrosslinkable polymers .	3.0209959356960603

These molecules can be polymerized using UV radiations in the presence of a photoinducer , a catalyst , and benzoin ethylether is used in most cases as an inducer for photocrosslinking .	3.373760607500585

These materials can be dissolved along with the enzyme and then polymerization can be started by exposing them to ultra violet light at 360nm for few minutes and then in few minutes the reaction is over and the gel preparation containing the enzyme molecule is made available .	2.8661319129043195

Another group of entrapment methods , gel entrapment method rather , is from the long chain polymers .	3.157638596799411

There are two major approaches by which these gel entrapment preparations are made from long chain pre formed polymers .	2.819983240470466

In the two earlier methods we have talked about the use of a monomer and an oligomer a prepolymer .	4.369421248336959

On the other hand here we are using a ready made polymer .	3.8088527502662033

The first method which is also a very commonly used method is ionotropic gelation in which the whole process of insolubilization of the polymer is based on ionic exchange .	4.433018282645206

The enzyme , water soluble enzyme is mixed with an aqueous solution of the appropriate polyelectrolyte .	3.5845785193209654

Most of the polymers used here are polyelectrolytes which can be mixed with the enzyme solution and a typical preparation which has been reported is sodium alginate .	3.802124666055299

It is a polysaccharide , negatively charged polyelectrolyte .	4.128307681470016

This polyelectrolyte is then mixed with the enzyme solution and this mixture is then added drop wise with addition into a solution of counter ions .	2.839332862801198

The sodium is replaced by calcium .	5.56742361040626

Calcium has been most commonly used so instead of sodium alginate you end up in calcium alginate which is water insoluble .	3.0312127255633703

While sodium alginate is water soluble polymer , it can mix with the enzyme solution and then this mixture is extruded through a fine syringe into a calcium chloride solution and agitated .	3.130445349223245

By the exchange of ions the sodium gets exchanged with the calcium , you get water insoluble beads .	2.4398741107591664

One of the major advantages of this method is that while in the case of previous methods you get the block of the gel and the gel block has to be mechanically dispersed into a particular shape for use in a reactor , here you can prepare the beads , the immobilized enzyme preparation , almost in the bead form so that that can be directly used .	3.0834637207092843

One of the disadvantages here is the stability of this material .	4.598483283338411

For example calcium alginate although insoluble in aqueous medium gets solubilised by certain ions like phosphate ions .	2.665888109560199

If your medium contains phosphate ions , calcium alginate will slowly get dislodged and you will end up in dissolution of immobilized preparation and sometimes instead of calcium , barium or aluminium is used as a counter ion .	2.4358922111474453

Such methods are very commonly used not only for enzymes but even for some of other biocatalysts like …… cells , this provides a very viable method for immobilization .	2.634323424661235

Second method is based on precipitation .	7.772849426430548

That means you change certain conditions in a way that the mixture of the enzyme and the prepolymer changes the solubility behavior and gets precipitated .	3.621102805293584

Some of the natural synthetic polymers that are very commonly used are : collagen , gelatin and agarose .	3.337233914157187

A large variety of natural polymers are used by changing one or more of the parameters in the solution .	4.08162230637264

Collagen which is a structure of protein , is found in the slaughter house waste .	4.688490005174956

Collagen can be taken mixed with the enzyme solution and you make a dispersion of the enzyme with the collagen solution .	4.807908124790404

You don ’ t really get a good solution .	4.374027978815411

Being a structural protein , you get a real dispersion of the enzyme .	4.754727653166962

This dispersion is then cast on a sheet so that you can get thin film of the enzyme entrapped in the collagen membrane .	3.6903142622927785

To provide stability to this film usually this film is subjected to crosslinking either by butyraldehyde or by ferric chloride .	2.4573961458228735

Different methods have been used ; so crosslinking becomes an important parameter to provide stability to the immobilized preparation .	3.434802747726624

Similarly in the case of gelatin , one can mix the gelatin solution with the enzyme solution and pull it .	3.273511202653936

Pulling will reduce the solubility and we will get a gel .	6.826348031798458

Collagen is not so good .	9.310879162011165

It forms the dispersion with the enzyme molecule and a collagen method is not exactly like a gel as we consider a poly acrylamide gel or an agarose gel or any starch gel .	2.856052137766544

It is a dispersion which is cast into a thin film .	3.471475501579096

Dispersion of collagen and enzyme in water is spread over a film , thin film usually .	2.8730062920783825

Preparation like this are made in the form of thin films and then to give the stability they are crosslinked and after it is crosslinked it becomes a permanent .	3.0047895923025814

You just add the cross linking agent after a film has been made .	3.8119814953297237

Yes algenic acid .	12.321257752191839

Another method , a very useful method , again for immobilizing mostly microbial cells is fiber entrapment .	2.759865443316035

The physical entrapment of an enzyme is achieved by dissolving a fiber forming polymer like cellulose triacetate which is water insoluble .	2.921644406987237

This is dissolved in a non - polar solvent like chloroform or carbon tetrachloride , methylenechloride and this organic solution of cellulose triacetate is then emulsified with the aqueous enzyme solution .	2.439445016819048

Stir the two solutions inorganic as well as the aqueous phase ; agitate it and you get a fine emulsion .	4.1286848636673215

This time emulsion is extruded through a spinneret just like you make nylon fibers and pass through a fine spinneret and the extruded fibers or the filaments are then dipped into a liquid coagulant like toluene or petroleum ether .	2.033058855984592

When these fibers are passed through toluene , they get coagulated , the polymer gets coagulated with the water droplets , the aqueous droplet of enzyme being entrapped in the fiber .	2.485999938777036

This is a spinneret .	8.476653012212532

This is put into a trough containing toluene .	3.8424839772533734

When it passes through toluene after residence time in toluene , the polymer cellulose triacetate gets coagulated ; it is no longer soluble and then the fiber that are formed contain the enzyme micro - droplets which was earlier emulsified into the solution of cellulose triacetate which are entrapped in the fibers .	2.366649306436739

Then these fibers can be used in a variety of modes in a reactor .	5.278166744169497

Even people have tried to make fabric out of immobilized cells which then can be used for variety of industrial applications .	3.606637096149345

The second group of entrapment method is on microencapsulation and in the case of micro encapsulation , as I mentioned earlier , the enzyme is enclosed within a semi permeable membrane ; polymeric membrane permeable to substrate and product .	3.065437801041279

Enzyme does not pass through but substrate or product must be able to pass through the membrane in the system .	3.5598015078327374

One of the major advantages is that it provides extremely large surface area for the enzyme substrate complex and the enzyme substrate contact within a small volume .	3.6934477829974335

But the preparations are too fragile because this semipermeable membrane is very , very thin and it provides you a very , very fragile preparation .	3.1257454473247117

Therefore its use in a number of industrial reactors is probably very difficult because it will not be able to withstand the shear and the mechanical load which an industrial reactor for chemical processing will require .	2.9202417760672366

But this method has been very extensively and very favorably used particularly for biomedical applications .	2.8551961423202767

For example the references as I have listed here by Chand and associates , which was reported in 1971 had asparagine in nylon microcapsules .	2.473547774627605

In the preparation of nylon microcapsules , an aqueous solution of the enzyme and hydrophilic monomer like hexamethylene diamine is dissolved in a buffer .	3.405009890643748

This is emulsified in a water immiscible organic solvent which is cyclohexane , chloroform mixture .	3.201613971273278

To the emulsified monomer solution , you add another hydrophobic monomer dissolved in the same solvent .	3.26938144171058

Hydrophobic monomer , in this case is sebacoyl chloride .	6.807804869278346

At the interface the two monomers gets polymerized and the reaction gives you a polymer what we know as nylon .	4.149647142354733

So the chain continues and you get nylon .	5.680756114865079

This method has been used very significantly for immobilizing an enzyme called asparaginase which is used as a therapeutic agent for persons suffering from leukemia .	3.092203536410171

One major advantage here is that the nylon molecule being non - immunogenic provides a much better material for putting into the human system .	2.8509493213582497

Carbohydrates or proteins are known to generate immunogenic reactions in the body whereas nylon is relatively inert as far as the immunogenecity is concerned and these capsules have been used for treatment of leukemia .	2.740313343528916

For most of the patients suffering from leukemia one of the problems is their lack of asparagine .	3.778378106012084

They lose the asparaginase enzyme , the enzyme which hydrolyses the asparagine in the system .	3.6445048955832284

While these methods have academic significance from the point of view of providing certain characteristics features but for industrial reactors they are not very suitable .	2.9177087992944126

I found applications in only biomedical applications .	4.180775965449961

What you have done is initially you have taken a hydrophilic monomer and the enzyme solution in a buffer , in an aqueous buffer , mixed it into an organic solvent .	3.502566904186325

So you make a fine droplet , fine emulsion .	4.834256619825125

To this emulsion we add the hydrophobic monomer dissolved in the same solvent .	3.8777916372543064

So at the interface of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomer they polymerize and the enzyme gets entrapped into and these microcapsules are very fine in size .	2.70245881748234

The size can be varied from almost about two to three microns to ten microns almost like an artificial cell , a yeast cell for example .	2.5847097517039925

Almost they will be the size of yeast cells .	9.245741795011893

We have seen so far a large variety of immobilization methods .	4.015425570367879

If one has to really study various methods I think one must compare the various methods and to evaluate various methods for a particular job then these are the parameters which are needed to be looked into .	3.060766348333879

On the right hand side I have given you the various methods that we have talked about .	4.152720778689356

On the left hand side are the parameters which are important to be compared and there is no method absolutely reported in literature which can meet all the requirements .	3.125229649879848

There is no ideal immobilization method and each method has to be weighed in terms of its applicability and the parameters that are important are : method of preparation , binding force for example I have mentioned adsorption as a weak binding force as compared to covalent binding .	2.649373926626032

If you require a very strong binding force use covalent coupling .	4.1255022965074755

Yield is a very important parameter .	11.335142054782482

Enzyme loading … .	26.35797434887253

per unit carrier how much of the enzyme can be loaded and it is something like specific activity of a soluble enzyme preparation .	4.347570095517652

That means in so much of protein what activity can be carried out ?	3.742338878072923

Similarly enzyme loading in terms of carrier loading .	7.4291972812508655

Then the choice of carrier and in the choice of carrier the regeneration of the carrier is also associated .	4.550363897020703

The cost of the carrier and the regeneration capacity are directly linked .	4.096447000291331

The stability of the preparation and protection from microbial attack .	4.503287347171153

Most of the entrapment methods have a major advantage of protection from microbial attack because they are constrained within the four walls of a structure almost like microbial cells where all the enzymes or proteins are enclosed within a cell wall in the membrane and within a living cell the enzyme remains safe from microbial attack .	2.409829649770289

Similar situations can be looked from entrapment methods and finally the over riding factor often comes as cost .	2.6130489397353283

So all the methods are mostly considered in terms of these parameters .	4.9356074784521535

When we talk of the immobilization for industrial reactors the major factor is the cost and in terms of the cost it is desirable that when we produce them on a commercial scale using microbial cells , those enzymes which are intercellular in nature they could be used almost in the form of ….. ... .	3.0253839971305028

You need not disrupt the cells and then isolate and purify the enzyme and then immobilize .	3.368399652262658

Because isolation , purification is a very cost intensive operation for intercellular enzymes .	3.887539950353336

So in many cases of intercellular enzymes efforts have been made to immobilize the whole cell itself and the immobilization of the whole cell is a desirable feature particularly in the case of intercellular enzymes .	3.489694866546744

If the enzyme , the glucose isomerase is an intercellular enzyme and if one has to really isolate , purify and then immobilize probably the process will not be viable .	3.0788959488639134

Today the process is used industrially , commercially almost in half of the world wherever sucrose is not abundantly available , as a sweetener for glucose fructose mixture because the product cost is not very high .	2.4066292392829953

Therefore the use of immobilized cells provides a very viable alternative .	4.390737454116564

The conditions that are imposed on the use of immobilized cells are that the cells should not contain the interfering enzymes catalyzing the side reactions .	2.989831077577749

That means for example if you are using glucose as a substrate for a particular reaction , then the cell should not contain the enzymes that can also act on glucose and produce the side effects .	3.4905501147121867

Glucose is a substrate .	11.999487995857095

You will all agree that it is very difficult to look at the living cell or a microbial cell which will not have more than one enzyme and which will use glucose as substrate .	4.069577989749396

In the case of glucose isomerase or the immobilized glucose isomer is the form of … .	3.6803636313292576

we take advantage of the thermal stability of the enzyme .	6.473150850698309

The enzyme glucose isomerase is a very thermo tolerant enzyme of the order that the optimum temperature of the glucose isomer ranges between 70 to 80ºc and therefore you can take the cells give a heat treatment whereby most of the other enzymes which are able to act on glucose are inactivated but glucose isomerase still remains active and use that heat treated cells for immobilization .	2.919286658306504

So the cell should not contain any interfering enzyme .	3.6194325611519345

There are many preparations like for example preparation of fumaric acid from aspartic acid where the enzymes are too specific and usually there are no other enzymes present in the cell which will be able to utilize those substrate .	3.1076037193196746

Then the substrate product should also pass through the cell membrane .	4.035553994144806

So the cell membrane should be able to transport the substrate and the product across the boundary otherwise you cannot make the reaction feasible .	3.3716148678391997

For immobilized cell although theoretically almost all methods , variety of methods starting from adsorption to entrapment have been used sparingly , the bulk of the methods that had been used rather …. .. on industrial scale are based on adsorption or entrapment .	2.4765326104469874

Most of the entrapment methods very commonly have been used to entrap the microbial cells and as you will notice that entrapment within calcium alginate beads , polyacrylamide gel and cellulose acetate fibers have been commonly used methods for immobilizing .	2.469035851582606

The method remains the same as we have talked about the enzyme molecules .	6.1936241880491725

The entrapment of cells is much more because of their larger size than the enzyme molecule .	3.931156737899993

There are four adsorption methods which are based mostly on ionic binding because most of the cells have negative charge on the surface and therefore any positively charged matrix can be used to adsorb the cells on to the surface .	3.1421332143352094

These adsorb preparations are usually in dynamic equilibrium .	4.067691493926083

That means if it is a growing cell then part of the cell will attach and some of the cells will be leaking out also .	4.058913881981097

But in the case of non - viable cells usually entrapment methods are the method of choice .	3.9048434181785545

We must here also probably make a distinction between living and non - viable cells .	2.8145513357306053

Living cells are usually used in those cases of bio - conversion processes where we require a series of enzyme reaction .	3.5781740471309154

More than one enzyme reactions is involved usually with a co factor regeneration that means a metabolic path way is involved with a metabolite to be produced or else if a single enzyme is desirable then it is always desirable to use non - viable cells .	2.6121148870624586

For living cells usually adsorption has been a method which had been very commonly used while for non - viable cells , entrapment is the method which has been most widely used .	3.043686761050871

When we talk of immobilization of microbial cells we could think of the cells which are viable , which can multiply .	3.0543204446595023

These multiplying cells or living cells are needed in those cases where the process requires a full metabolic path way which means a series of enzyme reactions which are interlinked for co - factor regeneration or for some other metabolite I mean uptake and production .	2.6238850233545525

In those cases living cells are used and usually these living cells have been immobilized by adsorption method because when they are living on the adsorption method although it is a method which regularly leaks out the cells from surface but then the new cells which are growing during growth phase they can also bind to the surface and then … .	2.6978055437150754

in a dynamic balance .	9.261733408581115

On the other hand if a single enzyme catalyzed reaction is the desired feature , then non - viable cells are desirable and they can be immobilized safely by one of the entrapment methods that we have talked about .	3.4675668943936993

Having looked into a variety of immobilization methods , we should also have a code to characterize an immobilized enzyme preparation by any method .	3.6197039450737725

Somebody has reported an immobilization method for a particular biocatalyst .	4.800317548605735

There has to be a common feature by which the immobilized preparation can be characterized so that the purpose of characterization is that the method should be reproducible by anybody .	4.03904575865697

Minimum information should be provided so that anybody who wants to reproduce the method can use it for further work .	2.4926687101668095

Some of these steps which I have listed here provide this .	4.51763854182658

These three things must be clearly outlined .	4.196335098412423

What is the reaction we are looking at ?	6.539653122753872

That means also involves which enzyme we want and what are the source of enzyme and the carrier which is required to be used for any method .	4.268429606090856

The second step is method of immobilization .	5.44249784783318

That means how do you prepare ; what are the reaction conditions ?	5.518000730701389

That means the reaction conditions and particularly more important is yield , loss of activity and the activity left in the supernatent .	3.350764305982222

So all that information must be provided in the methods of preparation .	3.598454489978029

Then the characteristics feature is physical - chemical characterization which means the biocatalyst shape , mean particle diameter or wet particle diameter .	2.6546998000462754

That means after swelling what is the swelling behavior of the particle and the compression behavior in the columns and abrasion .	3.8393213643984136

If it is to be required to be used in the …… .	6.393916538938986

reactor the minimum …. .. velocity and all those properties must be identified for a particular immobilized enzyme preparation and then we report any method .	3.6713153024412666

Finally kinetics and stability of immobilized biocatalyst a very important feature which probably dictates the choice of the immobilized enzyme preparation .	3.6743609620409554

As far as kinetics is concerned , as we have seen for the soluble enzyme , the substrate concentration versus initial reaction velocity that means the effect of substrate concentration on initial reaction velocity was the major kinetic characterization of soluble enzyme which gives you information about km , Vm and other kinetic parameters and normally by convention we represent the kinetic parameter for an immobilized enzyme or immobilized biocatalyst by k ’ m and V ’ m .	3.0442225726940935

Prime is added just to indicate that we are reporting an immobilized preparation , just as a convention .	3.380822889130086

That information must be known and the kinetic characterization will imply that the km and Vm values for an immobilized enzyme preparation might undergo change during immobilization .	3.0621479517088233

Other than the reaction kinetics there are other physical parameters which get involved particularly diffusion and partitioning , which we will discuss in detail .	3.320107186375689

Diffusional effects , then degree of conversion versus residence time at different initial substrate concentration , the reactor performance profile and finally the operational and storage stability .	3.1882939863897453

Data on all these parameters must be provided to characterize the particular immobilized enzyme preparation .	3.7747269412679256

We have so far discussed the first three parameters we will discuss this in our future discussion on the kinetics of immobilized enzyme.We stop with this .	3.4443652313543605

Welcome back to this course on Polymer Chemistry and today we will continue our discussion on Radical Chain Polymerization .	2.594373558090287

In this lecture , I planned to cover kinetic chain length and the molecular weight of the polymer produced in radical chain polymerization .	3.6457965922427067

And then I will discuss several or several different possible chain transfer reactions and their implications in terms of molecular weight and rate of polymerization .	3.640452324782148

Before I begin , just let us recap the discussion we had on radical chain polymerization in last two lectures , lecture 9 and 10 .	3.4549961256063

We begin our discussion with a general feature of chain polymerization , how chain polymerization compares with step polymerization .	3.489012617576383

And then we discussed how a monomer structures determines it is feasibility towards undergoing polymerization , polymerization reactions towards a initiator , different kind of initiator radical cationic or anionic .	2.387796590656978

And then we found out that during chain polymerization it is always head tail arrangement , head tail head tail type arrangements is always exclusively preferred .	2.925712571019483

We discussed different types of radical initiators , thermal initiators , photochemical initiators , redox initiators .	3.582661263592779

We also discussed different types of monomers or types of monomers , which can be polymerized in radical chain polymerization mechanism and which are the types of monomers , which cannot be polymerized or it will difficultly polymerized in radical chain polymerization .	4.109540100351336

And we talked about that , not all the radicals generated either by redox reaction or by thermal decomposition of any initiator species or by some other means , actually initiate a polymer chain part of which get lost due to some side reactions .	2.730409679015109

So , the fraction of the initiators produced during the decomposition of the thermal initiator or some other process , which actually initiate the radicals , we call the terms initiator efficiency .	3.055494671947711

And , you also discussed different steps involved in a radical chain polymerization and kinetics of radical chain polymerization .	3.8682563967960877

And in that way , we found the dependency of polymerization rate on initiator concentration as well as dependency of polymer rate on monomer concentration .	2.997968553921789

Now , let us begin or continue our discussion on molecular weight , molecular weight of the polymer produced in radical chain polymerization .	3.6151063573497946

Now , to start the discussion on molecular weight , we defined a term called kinetic chain length nu , which is which is the number of monomers polymerized per each radicals , that initiated the polymer chain .	3.6510142700111894

We can write number of monomer that polymerized , divided by the number of radicals that initiated polymer chain .	4.119820874971221

Considering the time , we can say that , the top one is the rate of polymerization , rate of disappearance of monomers and the denominator is rate of formation of the radicals , which is nothing but rate of initiation reaction .	4.515779754758345

So , we can write rate of polymerization divided by rate of initiation , now at steady state we knew that we know by this time , that R i is equals to the rate of termination .	3.7824395945870752

So , we can write nu as R p rate of polymerization by rate of termination , rate of polymerization given by k p M dot .	3.741745235607247

M dot is the concentration of all the radical species present , all the summation of the concentration , all the propagating radical and this is k t M dot square , or I can write simply it is .	3.8514550507953027

Now , we know from that steady state condition , where R i is R t .	3.9376531451817973

In the last lecture we found , that the value of M dot in case of a thermally induced polymerization , is given by f k d I by k t to the power half .	4.085644217098118

So , we can now write nu k p M k d k t to the power half from the last expression .	3.2328849955484467

The what is the importance of kinetic chain , why we are discussing or defining a term kinetic chain length nu , we will now know that , degrees of polymerization is directly proportional to nu .	3.375807451604341

Exactly we will know that , degree average number average degrees of polymerization is equals to b nu , where b is the number of initiator residue average number of initiator residue per polymer chain .	3.450878143793816

So , if we if kinetic chain length goes up , which means number average degrees of polymerization will go up , hence the molecular weight will also will go up .	3.9685844121752303

So , that is a importance of kinetic chain length , that if it is goes up or goes down , then accordingly the molecular weight goes up or goes down .	3.4302769625202885

Now , I hope you can you can get this , if we just look at this , that if I have a if I have a propagating radical having a active species here , if I have a if I have a radical here at the end of a propagating chain , I have another radical at the end of the propagating chain .	3.8270847843173925

This has a average number of molecules nu , this also have average number of monomer molecules nu .	4.522252245685206

Now , if this two propagating radical collide , interact and get terminated of a deformed dead polymer by this propagation reaction , then you get two polymer chain .	3.058443250270266

Two dead polymer chain , which will have again the same number of monomer molecules , which were present in the chain before the termination reactions .	4.829953180207877

Let us take a example , you know simple example and see whether we can visualize this more .	2.9617974255875885

Now , let us we start a reaction at t is equal to 0 , I have a say 1000 mole of 1000 moles of monomer M and say 10 moles of I , initiator molecules .	3.311156416721716

Now at time t , we stop the reaction and we found that , there are 400 moles of monomer still remaining .	5.09438395813788

So , how many moles of monomers has reacted to form polymers , is basically 600 moles of monomers reacted to form polymer chains .	3.198968786133777

Now , if I consider that I t , the consideration of or the number of moles of number of moles of let us do it in the next page .	3.980383563914213

At time t , we have 6 moles initiator remaining , which means four moles have been consumed .	2.8591297014147967

So , there are 8 moles of radicals produced during this time frame , during the polymerization reaction .	3.316419429406645

Now , if say 75 percent of this radical has initiated a polymer chain , so efficiency f is 75 percent that means , 6 moles of radical actually initiated polymer chain .	2.8065890601699715

So , number of , what is nu ?	5.934165550619493

Total number of monomers polymerized , which is 600 moles that is a number of monomers polymerized .	5.236619661894388

How many number of radicals has initiated polymer chains , that 6 moles so that is 100 .	4.29669270852547

So , 100 is the value of kinetic chain length that means , 100 monomers has , in a average every chain before termination on average every chain before it undergoes termination reaction , which we call kinetic chains has a number of monomer units of 100 .	2.9996247073910673

So , is clear , 100 means the number of monomers on average , which is present in a polymer chain before it undergoes termination reaction .	4.553368866045816

We call that chain as a kinetic chain , kinetic chain have 100 monomers .	3.4511293460371313

Now , what will happen this 6 moles of , there are 6 moles of chains before termination before termination or otherwise 6 moles of kinetic chains .	2.887818884977117

Now they will get terminated and form polymer molecules , dead polymer molecules .	3.800938604911959

Let us assume that , two moles of this , become dead or on the weight termination reaction by disproportionation reaction .	2.900498113924037

So , how many molecules , how many chains polymer chains , 2 moles because each kinetic chain 2 of 2 of the chain to 2 chains will come and react and form 2 dead chains .	3.06444049311328

So , 2 moles kinetic chain will produce 2 moles , now rest of the 4 moles , if I consider that they undergo coupling to get terminated , then they will also form 2 moles of polymers .	3.0466157679453496

Because , each 2 mole kinetic chain will come and interact and form one polymer so it get 4 4 moles of polymers .	2.9638451228221974

So , what is the average degrees of polymerization , number of monomers polymerized divided by number of polymer chains .	4.563225003798956

Because , this is a total number of monomers polymerized and this is the number of chains formed so that will give the number of average number of monomers present in a single chain .	5.728380547788058

So , that is 600 by 4 1.5 so that is nu is .	5.1911408986400716

So , that is 1.5 nu , which is 1.5 multiplied by 100 , 150 600 by 4 .	4.402255728988517

You can get same number , if I consider how many number of , we have in the mixture .	4.050726985858177

In the mixture , we have 2 chains or 2 moles of chains , X n bar with nu and 2 moles of chains with X n bar of 2 nu .	2.9667835924112946

So , again on average , we have 2 chains or 2 moles of chains with nu degrees of polymerization , 2 into 2 nu divided total number of chains is 4 .	3.134328979985772

So , 1.5 nu again you get this same number so fine so you will know how the average degrees of polymerization is related to the kinetic chain .	3.9730168873525957

Now , what is 1.5 , if you we can get this number , if we consider the number of , how many number of initiator residue present per chain .	4.708626399658846

Now , if I have one kinetic chain like this , the one end , this end you have a one initiator residue , which initiated the chain .	3.549949405954216

If I react with another kinetic chain , and form a dead polymer by coupling reaction , then you have a polymer chain , which have two residues .	4.97797915547841

So , a polymer formed by coupling of two kinetic chains will have two initiator residues whereas , if this undergo disproportion and form two different polymer chain , then each polymer will have one initiator residues .	2.4143877714661546

You have 6 moles of kinetic chains so initiator residues will have 6 moles , each kinetic residues have 1 moles and you have chains polymer chains , 4 moles .	2.760558993239371

So , number of initiator residues per chain , per polymer chain is 6 by 4 is 1.5 .	3.930215797334443

So , this number is nothing but the number of initiator residues per chain , which we call or term as b .	4.235505611206531

Now , we can get a more general expression of b , if we consider a more general example .	4.0396731393535985

See , if I have n is the number of kinetic chains , which means propagating radicals and of this a n , a is the fraction of this propagating radicals , undergoing termination by coupling .	3.614821202893765

So , total number of initiator residues in the polymer sample is , n is the number of kinetic chain so each kinetic chain will have one initiator residues .	4.326481501284303

So , total number of initiator residues in the sample is n and total number of chains , polymer chains , polymer means dead chains is , a is the fraction .	3.8766018088770138

So , n a is the number and if they are going termination by coupling so it is two of them produce one chain .	4.535003087685471

So , n a will produce n a by two chains and rest ( 1 minus a ) , which is undergoing termination by disproportionation , they will form one minus a by n chain .	2.470730880569324

So , if I know if I know X n and X n is given by b nu so from experiment if I know the molecular weight above sample , if I know the molecular weight and total total amount total gram , then we know number of chains as well .	3.130179011190798

And if we get the concentration of the initiator residues , then you can divide by the number of chains to get b .	5.377398089230305

So , we from that , we can know or experiment the determine b and if we know b , we can find out a or number of fractional chain , which are undergoing termination by coupling .	3.154561338239267

And 1 minus a are the number of chains , which kinetic chains , which has undergone termination reaction by the disproportionation reaction .	3.5256538406078732

Now , in this case , we go back and see how we define the average degrees of polymerization , x n in this chain polymerization is a number of monomer polymerized by the number of polymer chain .	4.220928501748325

What is the definition of X n , is the number of monomer units present average number of monomer unit present per chain , which is obviously will given by number of monomer unit consumed or polymerized divided by number of polymer chain , simple .	3.4730278568473563

Now , remember in the step polymerization case , what was a X n bar or average degrees of polymerization , again it was number of monomer molecules polymerized divided by the number of molecules present at the end of the reaction .	3.181931947200536

We have used that formula , number of molecules present at the end of the reaction that means , in the step polymerization case , we have considered every molecules present at the end of the polymerization is part of the polymer sample .	4.045028944771482

Because , there is no distinct no boundary between , you know in this case chain we have monomers and high molecular polymers , there is nothing intermediate .	3.85398665479012

So , we can easily remove the monomer molecules , which we can discuss the monomer molecules and we can only count the polymer chains .	4.528504815145637

But , in case of step of polymerization , we are talking about number of molecular present that means , each one each molecules whether it is a monomer or dimmer or trimmer , that also are in those are also included part of polymer polymer sample .	2.8124561779206974

So , when we talking about polymer distribution , it contains the monomer , dimmer , trimmer sample as well .	3.0423138878409035

So , in case , we find in a step polymerization , that our polydispersity is less than 2 , in spite of having a high molecular weight .	3.394128958815714

What could be the reason , we have found that in case of step polymerization , the polydispersity index is always two .	4.838597376540634

Theoretical polydispersity is always two , if we get a high enough molecular weight because that given by 1 plus p , p should be almost one to get a high molecular weight .	3.4958002126054755

So , ideal theoretical polydispersity index should be two but if we find some time , that even in spite of getting large molecular weight , our polydispersity index is lower .	2.6753122163269523

That could be because if we do the reaction in the solution and during the precipitation of the polymers , the monomer or the low molecular weight fractions remain in the solution .	4.488997168988121

So , what you finally measuring , what we finally measuring the polydispersity of the sample , which is the void of the monomer , dimmer , trimmer , which are suppose to be part of the polymer mixture , that is the reason we might get a narrower distribution .	3.3589185567427644

So , that is the fundamental one fundamental difference between chain polymers and step polymers , how do we calculate or how do you understand , what the average degrees of polymerization is or the average molecular weight average number average molecular weight is .	3.6599158589066354

In this case chain case , we do not consider the monomers , whether in the step polymers case , we consider every molecule present at the end of the reaction .	2.9003756275539754

So , if we got this , and you can write b R p by R t or R p by R t by b .	3.883587175556779

So , this is the average number of , we can get it from this and you know , unless the monomer is the monomer is sterically crowed .	4.860966236208697

If we are talking about a coupling reaction , then two radical chain ends has to come and collide each other .	3.2578235843486647

Now , unless the monomers is sterically crowded or they have a easily abstractable beta hydrogen , in majority cases they undergo termination by coupling reaction like styrene , acrylonitrile , methyl acrylate .	2.668581736520902

They are not very sterically hindered and either they have a beta hydrogen for elimination whereas , in case of methyl methacrylate because it has a beta hydrogen , which can be easily eliminated .	3.985680262372591

It undergoes termination reaction both by coupling as well as by disproportionation reaction , and as we increase the temperature , the fraction of termination fraction of disproportionation termination increases as we increase we increase the temperature .	3.340274977978393

So , till now , we have been considering the termination of this propagating radical by bi molecular interaction between two propagating radical , either by coupling .	3.1562976329801122

Now , there could be another type of reactions , by which propagating radical or a kinetic chain can get terminated , which is transfer reactions .	3.2574610931607517

So , now , let us discuss transfer reaction so if I have a propagating radical M n dot .	4.2634153640061205

It can react with the third molecule and form M n X plus A dot so here one kinetic chain , which was suppose to continue one chain is getting broken by reacting with X A and forming a new radical , now this new radical can initiate another chain like this .	2.3223595164228943

So , from one radical you have be discussing that , we had one kinetic chain , in this case from one radical , we have 1 dead polymer plus 1 another kinetic chain .	3.0972883621135066

So , basically for a given number of monomers polymerized , the number of chains at the end of the polymerization is no more .	4.544211559623316

As a result of this , the average number average degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight will definitely come down .	4.2274785344057

What are X A is , X A could be the initiator molecules , it could be the monomer itself to the solvent molecules , it could be the polymer itself or it could be any external agent .	4.288047117134661

External agent , which are could be added added deliberately from outside or it could be present as a impurities and we call some time call as this chain transfer agent or CTA .	3.075784047936255

So , give let us give some examples of this transfer reaction , when X A is initiator say , I have a reaction of acrylonitrile .	3.815038373683922

It can react with say , this case the benzoyl peroxide is initiator and it can check up this and from now , this can again react with the monomer and initiate another kinetic chain .	3.3258180917576166

So , this is example of , where you are getting a chain transfer by the monomer itself .	4.444151552097528

Examples , where X A is solvent , if I take carbon tetrachloride , then it can take up chloride and form CCl 3 dot .	3.469922368453523

X A being polymer , consider poly ethylene , you have another chain , it could be dead chain dead polymer .	3.432756208056779

Now , it can undergo further polymerization from here and form a chain here so it can undergo here and form a chain .	4.469614270764407

So , you may have a branching here so if transfer happen within polymer , you get branching .	2.947532072463687

Similarly , if this can back bite this can back bite and abstract 1 hydrogen from here , producing C C and a CH dot here , now this can react with monomer giving branches .	2.4841245538816175

So , in this case , if the chain transfer happen with another polymer molecule the two thing happening is , one you are getting branches and another important thing particularly for this case is that , X n bar does not change here , no change .	3.1139621999425877

You have started with 2 polymer chain when a transfer happened , you have same 1 kinetic chain and 1 polymer dead polymer chain .	2.892306571141752

In this case , you have 1 kinetic chain , intra molecular back biting you are resulting it , one kinetic chain so the number of chains in this case does not change .	3.4606190464060043

This is a special case of chain transfer , where because of chain transfer , the molecular weight does not change but it results in branching of the linear polymers .	3.7905265185908052

Examples of deliberately added chain transfer agent is like H S C 4 H 9 , if you are considering a reaction with styrene , this can initiate further chain .	3.209725253132707

So , what we just now learned we have learned what are chain what are chain transfer reaction and what are the different types of chain transfer agent could be possible , it could be initiator , it could be monomer , it could be a transfer agent , to be solvent in all this case , except the chain transfer to the polymers .	3.473840432448916

You are generating more chains at the end of the polymerization , which means that you are breaking a chain and as a result the molecular weight or the number average degrees of a polymers , polymerization is lower than , if there was no transfer reaction present .	3.6616024501036466

If I can write a general reaction like this , this is the rate constant for transfer reaction and this is rate constant for the subsequent initiation a propagation reaction with the a dot molecule .	4.653893301594111

So , we can write for monomer , we can write rate of transfer monomer given by , k transfer monomer M dot M .	3.959671138135208

For initiator , we can write similar transfer initiator , k transfer initiator m dot I similarly , we can write for solvent , CTA and so .	3.2863163805860167

So , in general , we can write rate of chain transfer is rate constant for transfer M dot X A , now there could be 4 possibilities 4 possibilities , this is the rate constant for the transfer reaction .	3.7543555616556867

Now a radical propagating radical can react with the monomer , which corresponds to k p , rate of polymerization and it can react with a transfer agent , which is your rate constant for transfer reaction .	4.3585534215782475

And when this is new radical is formed , this initiate a another new chain polymerization , with rate polymerization rate of rate constant k a .	3.0592980206258176

Now , case 1 k to k p and k transfer transfers much lower than the propagation so what happen , what is the effect on rate of polymerization .	3.6110562849700916

Rate of polymerization nothing but rate of disappearance or rate of consumption of monomers , now if this new radical formed for transfer reaction , they also consuming monomer in the same rate .	3.105486229462757

Obliviously , rate of polymers polymerization does not change so no change , what happen to molecular weight , obviously decreased .	4.144784593641276

Because , chain transfer always breaks the chain and the name we gave for this type of reaction is normal normal chain transfer .	3.519304556985179

Now , case 2 is again , k is similar to k p and k transfer is much higher than k p so R p rate of polymerization , again no change .	3.4973069256700584

Because , new radical form is also consume in monomer in same rate molecular weight because the number of transfer reactions rate constant for transfer reaction , is much higher than the chain propagation reaction .	3.5688785183996874

So , the number of chains undergoing transfer reaction is much more many more so the molecular weight drop significantly , it large decrease in the molecular weight and we call this as telomerization .	4.245963298693525

The third case is , k the new rate of polymerization with the radical form due to transfer reaction is lower than k p but rate of transferring rate constant for transfer reaction is much lower than the rate constant for the original polymerization reaction .	3.723137225235267

In this case we got , this rate is lower than chain polymerization , rate of polymerization come down .	4.404145694609864

So , as the molecular weight and we call this as retardation , whether is fourth case thus the worst case , where k is lower than k p and k transfer is higher than k p .	3.2207653387051063

In this case , because of this , rate comes down and because of this , molecular weight has large drop .	4.451242411888786

So , both large decrease in the molecular weight as well as the decrease the large decrease in the rate of polymerization and this we term as degradative chain transfer .	3.9809354856727754

So , basically under reaction , you get extremely low molecular weight polymers are oligomers and that to the rate of consumption rate of reaction of the monomers happen must lower .	3.8424455501050967

In this case , in the telomerization case , rate of polymerization is fast the monomer is reacted much at the same rate , as if there was no transfer reaction but the molecular weight drops .	3.8949539200277776

So , for a given time , you are getting illed , number of polymers you are getting more but the rate at which polymers monomers is reacting is similar as the original rate , for the molecular weight drop significantly .	3.366744808754132

So , now , write the kinetic expressions , now we are found that , this is the this is the expressions gives the average degrees of polymerization without any transfer reaction , where only the termination is due to either coupling or this propagation .	3.3840460595534387

And b is the number average number of initiated residues per polymer chain at the end of the reaction .	4.344504582867937

So , if a talk about transfer reaction , that include the other reactions , which by which termination takes place , which are other rates , that transfer by the monomer rate of transfer , by initiated rate of transfer , by solvent or rate of transfer by the C T H , chain transfer .	2.3994218280249613

Now we are not writing rate of transfer by polymers because as you seen that polymers , they do not contribute in terms of decreasing the number of molecular weight of the polymer .	4.070424878260729

So , we are not considering the rate for chain transfer in polymers case , so if I can write 1 over X bar , I can write R t by b by R p , similarly R transfer mono by R p and so on , other terms .	3.222732434465113

This is 1 over X n 0 , which means , that have number average degrees of polymerization reactions of any transfer reaction and you can write the rate expression for individual rates .	4.136173611062823

So , k transfer is given by rate constant transfer monomer , M dot M by k p M dot M plus , if I talk about the initiated then , k transfer initiated M dot I k p M dot M plus others , 1 over X n 0 n by k p plus k transfer I by k p I by M so on .	2.9060646790300466

Now , this is the rate of transfer rate constant for transfer by the original rate of propagation is , we are writing transfer coefficient or transfer coil constant .	4.377474973349377

So , this is the transfer constant for chain transfer constant for monomer , this is chain transfer constant for the initiator , similarly for solvent , we can write C S solvent by M plus C CTA , CTA by M .	3.1498850527018267

Now , this is mayo equation so any increase in the right hand side , anything which increases the value of right hand side , will decrease the molecular weight .	3.522146071110232

So , any absence of any transfer reaction , you get the highest molecular weight , which is basically the molecular weight we get in absence of transfer reactions .	5.353801302068624

Now , just look at this transfer once , typically in normal cases , the transfer to monomer and initiator are very negligible .	3.396137400972915

They did they generally do not take place and unless we had a transfer agent from outside deliberately all the impurities present , this also does not contribute too much .	2.8842802280757986

So , actually the main contribution for chain transformations chain transfer reaction is , the solvent so whether this might be significant for some particular cases , for this is very important for majority of the radical chain polymerization reactions .	3.615030461733955

So , let us discuss little more about this terms S and so basically for a given concentration monomer and solvent this is the value of C S will determine the chains transfer reactions in terms , which will determine the value of the molecular weight of the chains getting produced in this reactions .	3.6156498663391914

Now , if I go and look this M n M n dot chain one propagating radical , they can react with a monomer , which is k p and it can react with X X A it could be solvent in others , which is basically the transfer .	3.878726784587544

Now , this produces again M n bar M n 1 plus if we write , and this produce A bar plus X M n X .	2.846709687588288

Now , whether a chain transfer will happen and if it is happen how extent , it will determine by the reactivity compression between the monomer and the chain transfer agent of the solvent here .	3.6018914365519823

And also , the stability of this M n dot or A dot , if it is more stable , then it will be this reaction will be dominating over the original propagation reaction .	4.117490938870975

If the reactivity of the original radical propagating radical is very high , then it cannot distinguish that extent and other weight , even if there is a difference in the reactivity of these two molecules towards this .	4.293165856689939

If it is very reactive , then both of them will react , if it is low react less reactive , then between this two which is more reactive , that will react with this .	3.7701700759515964

So , that reaction will be prominent preferred , let us take example and see whether we can grass this .	3.371158798925709

Let us consider examples like benzene , we are talking about solvent .	4.1932327736824995

Let us consider X A as solvent so benzene cyclohexane , toluene , Methyl benzene , isopropyl benzene and tertiary butyl benzene .	2.4098349479934225

Now , it just react with M n dot and undergo a transfer reaction obviously , this is a hydrogen , which will abstract , Slide this is the hydrogen it will abstract from here .	3.66642979529822

And between this case , this is the hydrogen is more recently abstractable and in this case , it is this hydrogen is abstractable and this case , this hydrogen is abstract able and this case , there is no hydrogen here so this hydrogen , which is more abstractable .	3.813665632803522

So , what is the resulting radicals form in this case , this radical , this radical dot now , from your basic knowledge of organic chemistry , you know which what is the order of stability of this radical .	3.637678215188556

Now , the most stable radical is , it will participate in the transfer reaction in more extent , the lower is the if it is lower , then it will participate in the transfer reaction in lower extent .	3.6599290558203124

So , what is the value if I .	5.9908279048215185

So , what we will do in the next lecture , let us start from this page and look at the value of this C S transfer constant and is know , the higher the value of C S , the more the solvent participate in the transfer reaction so lower would be the molecular weight of the resulting polymer .	3.690559510535613

So , let us stop for this class this lecture now , and we will start from this page in the next lecture immediately .	3.3898773044292425

You are familiar with number of biomolecules like carbohydrates , lipids , proteins .	3.499727127079438

This enzyme falls into the category of proteins and the course will cover various aspects of enzymes , particularly in relation to their application as a biocatalyst in the process industries .	2.695377594176739

I think one of the very basic issues which come to mind is that why do we study enzymes as a separate class ?	3.299797070044026

In addition to your study of various biomolecules in other courses like Biochemistry , we have separate course on enzymes and some of these aspects I will be dealing in today ’ s lecture , which will basically be of introductive nature and also give you the scope of this course .	2.4429088405723705

The first issue as to why we study enzymes opens up many features of enzyme molecules and the first and probably the most important is their role in a living cell or their role in the realm of biotechnology as a whole .	2.9578697572459682

If you look at the basic definition or a very broad operational definition of biotechnology it deals with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services .	2.4132616528073827

Here I like you to mark the term biological agents and these biological agents cover microbial cells , cellular organelles , enzymes , may be other parts of the cells like membranes in a variety of biological material that can be used as a catalyst in process industries .	2.605565885304087

That is the upcoming feature of biotechnology and among these groups of biocatalyst enzymes play a very significant role .	2.765677763301952

If you go a little deeper into the various activities of a living cell besides looking at the industrial application , a living cell is a very complex entity .	3.5156084820981492

It carries out all functions of any chemical process plant that you have known or you can conceive .	3.6035741456609154

Most complex chemical processing plant say for example petrochemical complex where the petroleum is fractionated into various products and I like to give you a very simplified analogy of a living cell to that of a chemical process plant .	3.051409383496065

The cell does a variety of functions that is crushing and grinding , transport of materials , power generation , control of information , transmission of information and then release of finish products to the user client .	2.144941908632731

All these functions are also basically carried out by a living cell .	3.9469756072544504

Now the key issue is that all these functions in the living cell , may it be a microbial cell , may it be a plant cell or it might be an animal cell , they are mediated by the catalyst known as enzymes .	2.4314009546793205

Therefore the enzymes play a very central role in the function of living cells or in other words you can say that they are one of the most important executives in a living cell .	3.6796793362975913

Even disturbance in one of the enzyme catalysed reactions can lead to some abnormality in the cell function .	4.286758199635717

We are familiar with many of the diseases which are seen when one of the enzymes stops functioning .	4.574464037753754

Similarly in case of a living cell if the enzyme system fails many of the processes can be disturbed ultimately leading to the life cycle of the cell itself .	3.712884435375671

It is such an important component it becomes important to understand how they perform those reactions and how they manage the integrity of whole cell .	2.4912100348612762

There is a perfect control , fine tuning of the enzyme activities as per the desired requirements and we also know that the cells are energetical , in terms of material consumption are very efficient systems and wastage is minimum .	3.0297520900951147

The energy is generated to the required level ; materials are stored in case they are not needed .	3.4945678759394077

All those functions are a key part of the living cell and all these functions are attributed to the function of enzymes and that is where we get to understand enzymes in a more detail fashion .	3.881413986636885

Also we must appreciate that the cells , making these functions possible , carry out a large variety of reactions .	3.6854418342768134

They can range from hydrolysis to polymerization .	4.6784907374779845

We are all familiar of how the different components or molecules or intermediates in a living cell are synthesized .	2.8216630748729328

They all take place through a series of chemical reactions .	4.204153999621568

These reactions could be hydrolysis could be polymerization , could be epoxidation , could be reduction and so on .	2.6175794534704004

A whole lot of chemical reactions do take place in a living cell .	3.4878604864457876

The same scenario is that even a chemical process industry depends on a whole lot of chemical reactions which are catalyzed either spontaneously or with the use of catalyst .	2.872336316474014

The analogy lies that the reactions that are catalyzed by the enzymes in a living cell if they are carried out in an industrial atmosphere with perfect energetically economical situation , environmentally friendly conditions we have a good friend in enzymes and that is again another basis of use of enzymes in the process industries and also the possibility of studying them in such a great detail .	2.953070478067086

If you look at some of the aspect of enzymes and the process via catalyst , a very broad picture which refers to the role of enzymes as the bio catalyst , we must be aware that all these enzymes functions at the ambient conditions at the conditions at which living cells are known to live .	2.8487293891350656

There might be some exceptions .	7.333140695886992

The organisms that are found under very extreme conditions are exceptions but most of the organisms that live under ambient conditions produce or they provide us enzymes which can function under mild reaction conditions .	2.4200242771523293

That is the basis of their energetic efficiency .	5.750874362026937

That means the energy requirement of those reactions they catalyze could be very meager .	3.1408031554530838

They have high turn over number .	5.821053210189758

When we discuss the reaction mechanism we will see that they are very efficient catalyst and when I say very efficient catalyst our counter part to compare is the chemical catalyst .	3.789376934705903

There are a large number of reactions which can be catalyzed both by enzymes as well as by chemical catalyst and the subtle mechanisms that are involved in the enzymatic catalysis make them very efficient catalyst meaning a high turn over number or a significant reduction in the energy of activation of reaction .	3.15490727520508

The very characteristic feature of enzyme is their specificity .	5.337901158023111

It is advantageous in the sense that specificity will bring in lack of any byproducts because it will not act on any of the other substrate molecule which are present as additions or contaminant in the …… stream and you will only be reacting the desired substrate and converting it to product .	2.7135152001467757

On the other hand the disadvantage is from industrial point of view .	3.018393376906169

You cannot produce them in very large quantity because you require small quantities of catalyst for specific reactions .	3.0525579033621257

For example vanadium pentoxide or colloidal platinum can act as oxidation catalyst for n number of reactions or Raney nickel for hydrogenation .	2.600618069974189

Whatever has to be hydrogenated it can be used .	8.149773163270426

But the same scenario doesn ’ t happen .	4.348294945711582

You need a very specific enzyme and that brings in some sort of disadvantage as far as their role as industrial catalyst is concerned .	3.0549464190514186

Two of the definitely undesirable features of an enzyme as catalyst is they are relatively fragile in nature and with very mild deviations from their normal operating conditions they can be deactivated .	2.7392066348935673

The whole function is dependent upon a very subtle conformation .	3.8064922712281546

This conformation is result of not only covalent interactions but of a large number of non covalent interactions which can be disturbed very easily and that is why the deactivation of enzymes can occur and deactivation from industrial point of view is some kind of a loss .	3.079236782957878

The other factor is cost which is again an undesirable feature which probably applies to any commodity we want to use for industrial purposes .	2.9994750514476096

We will always like to choose a commodity which is less expensive and does the job and because the enzymes are produced in small amounts by the living cell and the only source of enzyme to us are living cells and they are synthesized in very small quantities .	3.0072470048755715

So obviously their cost per unit quantity is comparably very high and coupled with their stability it becomes an expensive proposition .	2.598456787497248

But we are also aware of the some of recent developments in biotechnology , molecular biology and other sciences which involve isolation , purification , as well as stabilization .	2.6471565371656123

The costs have been brought down , the concentration of the enzyme protein which can be synthesized has gone up and this situation is changing .	4.22817311429769

Another very significant equation as far as enzymes as processed via catalysts are concerned is between availability and applications .	2.732806919971806

We saw that they carry out lot a large number of reactions .	4.331593233894093

But although in a living cell various enzymes , which carry out these reactions are available their availability in large quantities for commercial applications are limited .	2.8215047582968182

As matter of fact only those enzymes which are required in bulk , when I say bulk I am referring to at least , if not tons , quintals many of them in tons really , they cannot be produced on a mass scale and their availability for commercial applications is limited .	2.493228354734476

There are certain classical examples of amylases , glucoisomerase , cellulase , lipase , proteases , which are the enzymes that are produced in bulk and are available in large quantity .	3.0351614696633518

The other part is because of their bulk production the cost has also come down and become reasonable for commercial applications .	3.241220060602214

The issue of availability is very intrinsically linked with the applications of enzymes .	3.5088887159030255

Unless applications emerge one will not like to produce them in large quantities .	3.727199070530963

The paradox remains .	12.07256330986834

The applications do not emerge till they are available in large quantity .	3.293835481843404

There are a large number of examples which will illustrate my point .	3.8242717581366814

Take for example a candidate like lipase - the enzyme that hydrolyses lipids into the consequent fatty acids and glycerol .	2.5783868186131773

Obviously the enzyme is not available in the quantities that many of the other enzymes , like amylases and proteases , are available .	4.039292462144428

But there is a potential that it can be produced provided the applications emerge so that the scale of operations which is required for bulk operation can be easily maintained and so the reversible interaction between availability and application is a very intrinsic feature and probably will illustrate the story of many of the enzymes which have become commercially viable today .	3.0790932085604372

As far as availability is concerned there are two major factors .	4.102960760792543

One is that we have to synthesize them .	7.786350946341461

Theoretically one can produce enzymes from any living source microbial , plant or animals but the trend in the reason past has been that the microorganism has been the preferred choice for variety of reasons .	2.265712609816486

Some of you may be familiar with them and most important one is diversity .	3.4402968550412387

Secondly you can choose micro organism which will be able to act on a particular substrate , synthesize required enzyme .	3.98702742478886

On the other hand you also have a very clear understanding of the genetic machinery of the cell , the microbial cell that controls the enzyme synthesis , which you will manipulate leading to hyper production of the enzyme .	2.6840376939672055

Their bulk productions , their bulk growth is very simple .	3.6031503746473894

The parameters , the equipment are all standardized thanks to many other products which are produced microbially that gives an edge for microbial biosynthesis of enzymes .	2.351475579160563

The other important part is isolation , purification and stability .	3.7192843137487026

In isolation and purification one of the very characteristic features is that most of the enzymes are purified by a series of steps .	4.022460450471756

An electrophoretically homogeneous protein means it is a perfectly pure enzyme .	4.859528706488911

For most of the industrial applications except for some of the medical or diagnostic applications you will not require a highly purified enzyme .	3.4705920132248904

For bulk industrial processing we have to stop at purity level somewhere in between .	3.6247831357279736

Compared to this crude enzyme where this specific activity is very low to a level where the contaminating enzyme that can disturb the process are revoked .	2.7223584863738153

But note that all the contaminants are revoked which may not be required because any order of purification will mean additional cost , enhancement in the value of the product .	3.143072154382765

As far as the applications are concerned a lot of engineering inputs are required particularly for the extended use of the catalyst and we don ’ t want to use it just once .	3.430912342896904

As a matter of fact I think one can take a clue again here from a living cell .	3.210209585926913

The cell maintains a very perfect economy in terms of its energy as well as materials to synthesize proteins .	3.579890597439063

It doesn ’ t use the proteins only once .	3.9873484896861084

It uses in a cycle and over a period of time .	3.2265269837368815

There is always a maintenance part where it has to maintain the protein synthesis but it is being used repeatedly and in many of the organs of the cell , the enzymes are supported on certain organelles so that they behave almost in a fashion of insolublised enzymes .	3.0306695722973713

On the basis of the same concept one can immobilize the enzymes on a support , insoluble support what we call as immobilize enzyme and use them for processes that can be used in continuous mode like any other chemical process , the term very commonly used in the chemical industry is heterogeneous catalysis .	3.028203782094127

Then a very important aspect is bulk environment design .	4.821224586484287

This today is probably not a very perfect statement because a number of enzymes have been shown to function even in a non aqueous environment or in other words more accurately micro aqueous environment where you require a very small concentration of water , rest of the bulk environment will be replaced by an organic solvent and that can give us a whole new range of chemical reactions which can be carried out using the enzymes and biocatalyst particularly a transition from hydrolysis to synthesis and many of these reactions have become commercially viable today .	2.7777705459170505

Ultimately for any process application of the enzymes you need to engineer the systems even after you have done immobilization , even after you have studied the optimum reaction parameter , the whole systems has to be engineered .	2.992615090893245

I mean to say that you have to develop particular hardware reactor , an enzyme reactor in which the whole reactions can be carried out with maximum productivity because ultimately the whole concept or the whole interest between will be on the productivity and which can be tailored by doing the proper process engineering .	3.0999997537155664

Then you may need to monitor certain parameters , the instrumentation control , down stream processing of the product , all has to be integrated so as to have a complete application route .	3.1046109552139836

In summary the broad objective of this course as I mentioned so far will be to study various scientific , technological and engineering aspects associated with the application of enzymes as a bio catalyst in process industry .	2.9013711715412396

This in brief terms can be the broad definition of or broad objective of this course .	2.7714680669368676

I like you to be very critical about the scientific , technological and engineering aspects .	3.345732016545813

Almost an analogy with the biotechnology in general even the enzyme technology also has a very multidisciplinary nature .	3.0993658330122504

It is not that one discipline for example understanding only biochemistry can lead to understanding of the applications of enzymes in the process industries .	3.2185879013079646

A whole range of basic and engineering sciences are required to be understood .	4.321188683559473

For example if you start let us say a basic science like chemistry .	4.151443715337879

Many aspects of chemistry have to be understood in relation to enzymes or in other words you can add the term biochemistry .	3.740452343580429

The functional aspect of the enzymes like the kind of chemical reactions they catalyze , the thermodynamic limits , the equilibrium convergence , the free energy change , whether the reaction is feasible , the coupling of reactions so that they become feasible in terms of free energy change and all those aspects of the enzymes protein will come under realm of bio chemistry .	3.3698658531417465

A very important role is played by physics .	4.9792764843419945

Today a large variety of developments that have taken place in the area of biotechnology in general and enzymes in particular can be attributed to the use of a number of physical techniques which have made us to understand a variety of systems and develop and improve upon them for various applications and physics becomes a very important component to understand the enzyme role .	2.7730585606765756

You are familiar that the result of these applications and developments is the science of biophysics as you know it today .	3.1612573840410256

After chemistry and physics I think the major scientific component will be biology .	3.149924399330214

For any enzyme to be produced in large quantity you need to identify a biological system which can produce the enzyme .	3.3114965127903204

It can be microorganism , it can be a plant or it can be animal .	5.549637338392911

The bulk of the applications or in the bulk of the cases of enzymes we will look at microbial systems .	5.107784529190707

That is the component which biology will make us understand .	3.3202192782237088

We will have to understand its morphology , its physiology so as to be able to design an appropriate enzyme production system .	3.404834309211801

The role of protein biosynthesis were their organism which will regulate the synthesis of enzymes .	2.8705316002948744

The regulatory mechanisms involved in the bio synthesis of those enzyme proteins will also be understood through biology .	3.6098282097686276

In the recent years an added dimension is molecular biology where we tend to understand the structure function relationship of various biological molecules at a molecular level .	2.486510871415269

How nucleic acids take part in information transformation from one cell to next generation , what are the mechanism of cell - cell signaling , communication between different cells or how does the protein molecules behave as a defense molecules ?	2.595906214212495

A very important scientific development has been in the computational science .	3.4034256851068876

Most of the industrial applications will require the application of computational science in those systems .	3.5187451576998754

Today even design of an enzyme protein , modifications for tailoring it to give some desirable property is a job which can be taken up only with the help of computational science .	3.021666489245993

Experimental sciences will take years together to come out with those conclusions which can be brought in by many of the computational programs .	3.3149973724259367

You will need lot of data available to you before you can apply them but once the data are available one can easily compute and predict many of the behavior which otherwise would have taken a very long time .	2.4117845217869514

For example site directed mutagenesis is what happens if an amino acid is removed and another amino acid is inserted in the polymeric chain that is in the protein chain .	3.4024647884899237

Its structural behavior can be very easily understood with the computer graphics which otherwise doing experimentally probably is a Herculean task .	2.5263553790025832

These are some of the basic sciences which are important .	4.981169298348536

On the other hand we have a whole range of engineering sciences which are important as far as enzyme technology is concerned .	3.2371903249452743

You need to design enzyme reactors which can take care of transfer of materials ; transport of energy , transport of momentum and all transport processes can be taken care .	2.7454581127268325

You need instrumentation for monitoring and control of the reactor , you need the concept of electronics particularly in some applications like biosensors , enzyme will require transducers and the ultimate is biochips .	2.482696754125471

We are far from the reality but still as the concept it has probably attracted the attention of many scientists .	2.283666559695782

That means can be used in the protein molecule or enzyme molecules as biochips in the computers .	4.2549965007000115

The whole computation becomes based on biological molecules .	3.6932050467107476

So a large number of engineering operations including mass transfer , heat transfer , material balance , energy balance , product separation , kinetics , thermodynamics is also involved in understanding of enzyme science and therefore one of the characteristic feature is that the whole enzyme science interfaces with a large number of basic engineering sciences and it is this interface which makes it so attractive to study , exciting to study and important to study .	2.6562040742489836

Today it has become impossible probably for a bio technologist to leave aside an enzyme molecule , understanding of enzyme molecule in detail before he can call himself to be a professional in the area .	2.6933667188860495

Another important aspect which I think I will like to touch upon in today ’ s lecture will be on enzyme classification .	3.0120506322387373

Now you will be surprised to know that so far globally about three thousand enzymes have been isolated , characterized and reported in literature .	2.760977374533529

It ’ s not a very large number compared to the feasibility of combinations that are feasible .	4.462243604110301

If we look at enzymes as a polymer consisting of nineteen different amino acids with an average length , let us say 150 or 200 amino acids linked together .	3.1129059534558126

With nineteen different amino acids probably the possibility of , variety of , diversity of proteins that are feasible is enormous almost approaching infinity .	2.7978374343335464

We have been able to isolate and characterize only about three thousand .	3.2597859494337493

In fact this job was done way back in early seventies by international union of pure and applied chemistry , what you know as IUPAC .	2.3390035601108288

They gave a classification system which is acceptable globally today and it classifies all the enzymes into six major classes ’ : oxidoreductases , transferases , hydrolases , lyases , isomerases and ligases .	2.2583391339677363

The whole range of chemical reactions or bio chemical reactions that take place in a living cell are mediated by these different classes .	3.4487177790420573

We must know that some of the reactions are not independent .	7.299548907435278

They are coupled there by producing effect which could be a polymerization reaction .	3.8974818116543175

Directly a polymerization doesn ’ t take place as it is .	4.358666095893245

It is mediated by series of transferases and then ultimately the transferases and ligases .	3.039275269326543

Ultimately you end up with the polymer of different monomers .	6.836408908209048

But basic enzymes can be classified and each of this class is also characterized in sub classes .	3.481439154541251

Sub classes refer to the type of substrate or the type of the product that is produced by those enzymes .	4.437327623339851

So basically the whole range of each of the class here oxidoreductases a bulk of the oxidases , reductases and the hydrolases fall under this category .	2.777166190534485

Transferases involve group transfer reactions where one of the functional group with a substrate molecule is phosphorylated .	4.255110888381094

Usually they are bisubstrate reactions involving two substrates .	4.2988484932352895

In hydrolases by and large the most commonly employed industrial catalyst is used mainly because of simplicity .	3.881771594560671

Because the co - substrate is water which is present in large quantity and one can use them for hydrolytic reactions .	4.23934320381006

By changing the bulk environment hydrolysis can be tailored to be used for synthetic reactions as well .	3.673960880978681

In lyases an additive enzyme which catalyses the elimination reactions that result in the double bond formation is used .	3.056911879994695

Isomerases are another important catalyst of industrial enzymes which isomerises one molecule into other isomerable molecule .	2.504847960052213

One of the most significant enzymes under this class is isomerization of glucose to fructose .	2.8947117732978085

Ligases join two molecules at the expense of energy source .	4.196067635486902

In most biochemical reactions ATP is the energy currency which is consumed and regenerated through catabolic processes and such reactions are classified under ligases .	2.379242694051819

This is the classification based on the IUPAC nomenclature more from the scientific point of view .	3.495855091258921

But from the industrial point of view or from the application point of view another important type of classification which is made is in terms of three classes what we know as bulk , diagnostic and therapeutic .	2.929531657695705

This classification is based on the cost of the enzymes .	8.262913219846249

In fact the cost of the enzyme is directly linked with the concentrations in the starting material .	4.616515876246101

It could be a fermentation broth in most cases .	5.1873650430071105

In the fermentation broth if the concentration of the product or the desired enzymes is very low the cost is very high and second factor of cost is the application and the degree of purity you need for that particular application .	3.8250249849895734

The bulk enzymes as you can see here they fall in this category .	4.07665355245029

The concentration in the starting material is of the order of about one kg per meter cube which is significant enough to recover and you don ’ t require for the most cases a very high degree of purity and therefore their cost is also reasonably low say for example about thousand US dollars per kg .	2.668298218599811

The next category is diagnostic .	6.137426296357286

It includes also analytical enzymes .	5.871896874896363

This is the concentration in grams per meter cube level which is much lower .	4.023024114397305

Degree of purification required is also larger because you will not like any protein contaminant present in the sample and their cost is therefore significantly high of the order of about 106 US dollars per kg .	2.8878318781237797

You should not get threatened by the amount of cost of 106dollars .	4.474225768496211

The quantity required is also in micrograms .	6.479065129894721

They are not in kilograms like other molecules .	4.55393173814491

So they are affordable .	7.7214760732651735

The third and probably most expensive classes are therapeutic enzymes which are exclusively required for medical applications almost like life saving drugs .	2.506629252115346

Their cost is immaterial and you don ’ t make choice on the basis of cost .	3.594000111789902

But if effectiveness is the same the cost is the principle determining factor .	3.9943972671145

In the case of therapeutic products , the choice is not on the basis of cost but on the basis of its need if it is a life saving drug .	3.320948788825444

Many of the therapeutic enzymes particularly the recombinant proteins that are available from the enzymes like streptokinase and urokinase are blood clot dissolving enzymes .	2.568376435882257

Similarly a number of other such therapeutic proteins or enzymes are available like asparaginase , for patients suffering from leukemia , which is again life saving .	2.861453023608258

The cost is also of a very high order but the quantity required is of less than micro gram quantities but in a very highly purified state .	3.306611889009724

The last phase of today ’ s lecture will cover on course outline and references and the course will broadly cover these aspects .	2.3182767572104375

I have given you some idea about the introductory remarks on the enzyme as process biocatalyst .	4.312343453062517

We will go into little more details on the chemical nature of enzymes that means enzymes or proteins .	3.0416326904662303

We will go into functional nature of enzymes , enzymes as the catalyst and what makes them such an efficient catalyst ?	3.0293006327079293

The factors which are responsible for their deactivation , the approaches that are available for stabilizing the enzymes , the role of active sites or ligand binding sites on the enzymes will be dealt in functional nature .	2.952247394656469

Then we will go on to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions because reaction kinetics will play a very important role in the choice of enzyme reactors , to understand reaction rates and the role of associated physico - chemical interactions that will take place once you immobilize the enzyme or use them in bulk environment other than water .	3.146500336271944

One of the most significant tools which have made many of the enzyme reactions commercially viable is immobilization of enzymes .	3.5888853864787214

A large number of techniques are used and we will discuss them in detail .	4.874288505929173

The use of enzyme reactors , the types of reactors that are possible to be used with the mobilize enzyme , with soluble enzyme , their characteristic features , comparison between their performances , how to choose the enzyme reactors , then mass transfer and immobilize enzyme reactors .	2.796763272433565

Immobilization of enzyme will have some additional physico chemical features like diffusion and partitioning .	3.3657933532249533

When they are placed in a reactor how do they influence the performance of the system ?	4.226313152775459

Immobilize cells very often in the enzymes are intercellular .	5.278028017080883

It has been felt that for many applications their isolation and purification is not required .	2.866288355527171

You can immobilize the whole cell as long as you do not inactivate other contaminating enzymes in the cell which will interfere in the process .	3.587573439515615

In the bio process design , some of the basic design principles for the enzyme catalyzed processes .	4.19138667141752

A few case studies I like to illustrate some of the earlier issues with respective to specific cases and ultimately I think I like to take up enzyme based sensors .	2.8680135584190976

The enzyme sensors have become an important activity where immobilization enzymes are used .	2.906798083608118

Both immobilized enzymes and immobilized cells are used .	5.729081392464342

They have become very important tool both in diagnostics as well as monitoring of information from reactions .	3.3694645779417134

This will be our course outline .	5.128739319372237

Today , we will continue the discussion we had on step growth polymerization .	4.263638208670541

Before we start the topics of the 7 th lecture , let us recap what we have studied in the last lecture .	3.3983544435136466

They are sometime , as I mentioned in last lecture , that you might require to control , restrict the molecular weight of the polymer you are making .	4.18263717070866

And we discussed the two methods , one being that you use a slightly stoichiometry , one of the monomer in little excess .	3.889639729426638

And the second was that you can add a mono - functional monomer in slight amount by , then by doing this you can control the molecular weight .	3.8846674010082345

You also studied the molecular weight distribution and we found that , we found that in , in case of number fraction of the different molecular weight chains , the lower molecular weight chains , the the chains , which are having lower molecular weights , they represent in maximum number .	3.7741127174082822

Now , if you talk about weight fraction , then the weight fraction of different chain length molecular weight was maximum for a given molecular weight .	3.2287678807332485

We did a calculation to find out , that M W and corresponding PDI , poly dispersity index , which is M w by M n and which we found , that it is PDI equals to 1 plus p .	3.2024213650909963

That means , for most of the polymerization , step polymerization , when you are making high enough molecular weight as we know by this time , that p should be very close to 1 , that means , for any given high molecular weight step polymer the polydispersity is expected to be very close to 2 .	3.743131024067524

But I said , that in practice , in industry , when one makes a step polymer , seldom the distribution , the PDI value comes to around 2 , always it is found to be slightly above 2 , say between 2 to 2.5 and so on .	2.554644146097313

I said the reason as well , that because there are possibilities of size reaction and one such size reaction being cyclization , there is invariably formation of some small molecular weight cyclic molecules and as a result , when you have the small molecular weight cyclic formation , both the M w and M n comes down .	3.0001903825511587

But as we know , that small molecular weight effects M n more , that means , the percentage of drop in M n is more than percentage domain M n and M w .	3.727795379306715

As a result , M w by M n goes up .	3.4436781377650716

We also discussed at the end different ways of a molecule , whether it is a monomer or a oligomer , can undergo cyclization and we will continue that discussion today .	3.8833820535236887

And I talked about two options in a monomer , they can intramolecularly cyclize or in oligomer , they can , if their reactive functional group , they can cyclize as well .	2.323497762315012

Now , there is a third , third option where a growing chain can polycyclize , let us look at that option as well .	2.977547331909346

Say , you have an oligomer or a polymer chain of hydroxy - carboxylic acid , which is polyester .	4.014181470760074

Now , this can undergo intermolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction , which we called back biting , is basically the one end of the polymer chain is biting back in the main chain of the polymer forming a cyclic molecule and another molecule .	3.758910765512128

So , this is another way we can cyclic and form and this is the process is called backbiting , from the end of the polymer chain to the back bone of the existing polymer chain .	3.8172670026250333

So , that is backbiting by substitution nucleophilic reaction .	3.720748598185183

Now , as I said that the extent of cyclization in comparison to linear polymerization depends upon both , thermodynamic factor and as well as kinetic factor .	3.4142603337567268

So , it depends upon both .	8.985330620105268

Now , we started discussing about the thermodynamic factor .	4.6010746925074555

Thermodynamic factor is nothing but the stability of the forming cyclic rings .	4.570568313673316

For example , we know from our organic chemistry knowledge , that general order , general order of stability of different , of different ring structure follows in the following order , that a ring containing three or four atom in a ring is least stable or lowest , lowest compared to a 5 - membered or 7 to 13 - membered ring , which is even lower stable than 6 - membered or a 14 - membered ring and higher and that we know from our organic chemistry knowledge .	2.2502687100911802

That is because we have , in a small ring we have more ring strain and torsional in a big chain you have a torsional strain as well .	3.0259927051151334

So , obviously , formation of 6 - membered or 4 - membered or higher membered ring will be always preferred thermodynamically compared to a ring size having 3 - membered or 4 - membered in it .	2.668510888866206

So , which means , that in thermodynamics , factors will favor formation of a 6 - membered or 4 - membered or higher membered ring in case of cyclic formation .	3.085457555778607

Now , does it mean , that always you have formation of cyclic , for example , 14 and higher members ?	3.240092378154962

Now , as you can imagine , that if you have a polymer chain or oligomer chain having 14 or higher carbon atom or other atoms in , in the , in the backbone , now this is , this trend is valid for , not only for rings having only carbon atom in the ring , but it also valid for the rings where you have heteroatom , like say for example , ethers or esters or amides as well .	3.159945207849092

This is true for almost every possible ring .	4.5493940304382745

Now , I was talking about , that if you have a larger ring , larger linear molecules , say having 14 or higher number of atoms in the , in the ring , in the linear molecules , then they have so many conformation , this , as the more or the higher is the number of atoms or longer is the chain , you have more number of conformation of that molecule possible .	3.1435281020872066

So , in terms of kinetic factor the higher the chain length , the lower is the possibility of formation of ring .	4.790358563474487

Now , if you talk about the rate of polymerization , which will help us in designing reaction conditions , which will minimize the cyclic formation , let us look at the rate of ring formation or cyclization and , and the linear polymerization .	3.7774959771756573

Now , as we can imagine or understand by now , that ring formation is a mono , unimolecular process , whether linear polymerization is a bimolecular process ?	2.7474976929825146

So , I can write the rate of cyclization versus rate of linear polymerization is k c rate constant for cyclization and because it is a unimolecular intramolecular reaction , so we have this .	3.781245859906574

And rate of k , polymer , polymerization and because it is a bimolecular reaction , so we have M square , which gives us k c by k p 1 by M .	3.7694243719964615

Now , as long , as long as M is less than 1 , molar cyclization will be preferred .	4.852548614605773

If M is higher than 1 molar , then linear polymerization will be preferred that you can see from this expression .	4.798666455393576

Let us , only from the concentration of the monomer you can find out , that if it is below 1 , then rate of this , rate of cyclization will be higher and if it is above 1 , this will be a fraction .	5.111318586832511

So , the linear formation will be rate of polymerization will be higher .	5.1075367006997086

So , it is always advisable , it is always advisable , that to minimize the cyclization , we always use the maximum possible concentration of the monomers and the base can , we can do if you do a bulk polymerization , that means , which we are doing the reaction with the monomers and , and the catalyst , if required .	3.671492971461519

So , so that is the maximum possible concentration you can have in , in to minimize the cyclization .	5.408777686466413

As , as a reaction progresses or the conversion goes up , now as we know , that k p is independent of , independent of conversion or the reaction , time of reaction and which comes from the fact of the assumption of equal reactivity of the functional group and we have seen in earlier lectures , that experimentally , that is also true , that rate is independent , rate independent on the conversion .	3.1502890870705644

So , k p is constant throughout this process .	5.41799851737324

So , now what happens , what happen to k c , rate constant for cyclization ?	3.9197882111931586

Now , as we have seen just now from the last page , that if you grow the chain , as the reaction progresses , that more and more conversion happens , the chain grows .	3.692128361413836

Now , as the chain grows , the possibility , the kinetic feasibility of the two functional groups present at the end coming and reacting to form ring , ring , comes down , which means , that k c comes down as a reaction progresses because the kinetic feasibility , that the longer the chain , that chances , that two end will come and react each other forming intra - molecular reaction , forming a ring , is always lower .	2.7114980716711234

So , as the reaction progresses , as p progresses , k c comes down .	3.4404988454951484

So , then the rate of cyclization also should increase in that process .	4.742584989276805

So , if the k c come down with concentration , with conversion , the cyclization should come down , whereas this is acting in opposite direction .	2.610057465756126

As the concentration of monomers comes down , the rate of cyclization will go up .	5.986357897200689

Now , it , it has been generally found fortunately , that this effect is less compared to this , which means , for general step polymers when you go for higher and higher conversion , the rate of cyclization comes down because the k c , the value of k c comes down because of kinetic feasibility .	3.1109659965789827

So , that is , that is good .	6.149827223231373

So , as we , in most cases the cyclization tendency comes down as we make higher and higher molecular weight .	3.477757736567927

Now , what is the , what is the problem if I have some , few cyclic molecules in , in the polymer at the end of the polymerization ?	4.518850507324405

First of all , we have seen , that presence of this small molecular cyclics will increase the polydispersity index , which means , the distribution of the polymers chains and which effect property in , in several cases , not coming to specific examples , but it , it , it does effect the polymer property in , in several cases .	3.015067188183538

And also , if this cyclics are present in the polymer mixture , they are sometimes very detrimental in the polymer property .	4.621519670824519

Because during the polymer processing , when you take this polymer and process mix with something compound and then take that compound at granules to make some final product by say , molding process , being low molecular weight this cyclic molecules tend to come up to the surface .	2.4937577902948544

They , they preferred , they are , they prefer to be in surface .	4.109119894093106

So , during the molding process , they actually migrate to the surface and they prefer to be in the surface , which actually is very detrimental from the products properly point of view .	2.9655393706829525

So , in most cases it is preferred , it is done , that at the end of the reaction some additional steps are done to strip off the cyclic molecules , small cyclic molecules from the final product , so that when you take that polymer , which is in the , at the end of the reaction , which you are taking forward for molding process , which will be , have least amount of cyclic , cyclic molecule present .	3.1321156901623213

So , now we , this reaction step , reaction can process , you know , undergo in thermodynamic control way or a kinetic control way .	2.5813814346170254

What is thermodynamic control ?	7.860843674680898

Now , in this case , the linear and cyclic molecules , they are , during the entire reaction they are in equilibrium , whereas in kinetic control process they are not in equilibrium .	3.367169018623987

The reaction proceeds without establishing a equilibrium between the cyclic and linear species here .	3.0438715849966296

Whereas , in terminal control polymerization , there is equilibrium , between cyclic molecules and linear molecules there is a equilibrium .	3.71224298253578

So , entire , during the entire process , polymerization process , this equilibrium exist .	3.658291040069949

Now , this one example we can give , the normal , excuse me , normal hydroxyl acid , you know , normal ester formation , polyester formation from diacid plus diol to give polyester plus H 2 O .	2.4739057444132384

Now , as you can see , the H 2 O can take part as long as H 2 O present in medium , they can take part and hydrolyze the cyclic molecules and so that they can , cyclic molecules open up and undergo further linear polymerization or take part in further linear polymerization , and new cyclic small molecular formation take place and so on .	2.8033671541043264

So , in this case the reaction proceeds maintaining equilibrium between cyclic and linear polymerization .	3.241374669216436

In case of kinetic control , as I said , that it does not maintain the equilibrium .	4.487700931886674

For example , if you have a diacyl chloride plus diol , which forms polyester plus HCl .	3.178169238529592

Now , HCl does not take part in reaction with the polyester , whether it is cyclic or linear polyester , which means , that in this case there is no equilibrium present between the cyclic and the linear polymer molecule .	3.56619789973576

So , what is the effect of formation of cyclics in the molecular weight or the degree of polymerization of the final polymers , which can be arrived from Carother ’ s equation and without going into derivation we can write , that X n is 1 by 1 minus P , where x is a constant , depends on concentration of the reactants and a is rate of linear polymerization by rate of cyclization .	3.673826674796539

Now , this two term , this , this expression is not very useful because the values for x and a are not available for most cases .	4.062215435264093

So , so this is , this is good to know the expression , but this is not very useful because we are , we do not know the values of x and a all the time and as a goes lower , that if more cyclization happen , X n comes down compared to if there were no cyclization , which in this case X n was 1 by 1 minus P .	3.4574640613769385

In case of absence of any cyclization , just pure linear , linear chain formation we have seen the Carother ’ s , Carother ’ s equation from earlier lectures , that X n is 1 , 1 over 1 minus P .	2.8495696732602007

So , because of cyclization x n comes down .	4.0187287782758965

So , more and more cyclization happen , the degrees of polymerization also come down .	4.730891467161387

As we realized in the beginning of this lecture as well , that as the more cyclic molecules , small molecules form , it affects both , the degrees of polymerization number , average degrees of polymerization and the weight average degrees of polymerization , but it affects more the number average degrees polymers compared to weight average degrees of polymerization .	2.893487469630603

So , you get the PDI higher than 2 .	5.661702554348962

Now , at a is very high , is very high , if , if a is very high , that means , almost absence of cyclization , then X n would be 1 minus 1 minus p , which is basically giving us back the the original Carothers equation for linear polymerization , linear step polymerization .	2.930943510798706

Now , this molecule can again and do a nucleophilic substitution reaction and they can exchange the parts in two different chains , but in this case there is no change in number of functional group , functional groups .	3.417981887006308

So , so no change in number of molecules , either as a result no change in X n bar , no change in molecular weight as well .	4.822178020626637

So , this statistically does not have any significance in terms of final polymer product , in terms of their molecular weight or molecular distribution .	4.182410433249133

If you are starting with two different oligomers and you are starting the reaction from there , at the end of the polymerization you will find that this chains are reshuffled and they have a uniform composition across .	3.0400715799027105

But when you are starting with the monomers , it does not matter , you will finally going to get the same polymers , whether there is or there is not any reshuffling exchange reaction between the two growing chain .	3.732062476939311

This is just for your knowledge .	5.932007936428947

Now , let us go to next topic which is branching and cross - linking .	3.3761444266912037

Let us say , I have a molecule A and B functional group and I have a molecule like this , which have three A functional group and how they will react .	4.128550867414115

Obviously , A can only react with B .	6.551133004333553

similarly , this side , it will react with B , other side will be A .	4.2904728071398335

And similarly so here also it will react with B A B A , something like that .	3.7480692352761005

Now , you can see this , in this case you always have A group at the end .	5.173909169052497

Now , this is the branch , this is the main linear , linear chain and this is the branch and number of branch , obviously , will be depend upon the , the moles of this , this group .	4.2888766595348145

Now , we are writing this is A f , where f is 3 here .	3.844071839395401

So , f is 3 here .	8.042543037108185

You know , growing chain , cannot react with this only react with the monomer .	4.502166542470978

So , if I , will this branch react with any other chain growing chain ?	2.9422086453339444

No , if I have to , if this branch has to react with any other chain , any other polymer chain , then it has to find B group , which it can react , but there is not any polymer chain having free B group at the end , which means , that it cannot undergo reaction with another chain , which means , in this case there would not be any cross - linking between two polymer chain .	3.4196474744995227

Cross - linking is when you have a branch or you have a connection between two chains .	5.435008243056323

If I had a chain here , then this is the cross - linking , it would have been cross - linking .	4.510070585536491

So , let us take another example .	6.591448311591614

How it will react ?	11.922533026852532

This one , A A plus B B B f and where f is 3 or higher .	3.274751478198561

Obviously , this reaction will be A A B B B A .	5.153628209124483

Suppose , this B comes here and you have B B .	5.399204769216384

Suppose we are talking about f is 3 , this will react with A A .	5.042842389293163

Again , B B , this will react with A A and B B and so on .	4.393869230346845

Now , in this case you have A B or if you have here A that means , in the polymers you can have the two functional groups at the end .	4.702752086342264

So , if I have some polymer chain , which branch having A A at the end , now what will happen ?	3.7525834522737345

This two can react and form a connection between two linear chains .	4.241654918654213

Now , this is what cross linking is all about .	5.016786146287163

In earlier case , there was no cross - linking possible between two linear chains , but in this case , because they are functional group , free functional group present , both types , it can undergo a cross - linking reaction .	3.058783880845829

What are the other types it can undergo ?	6.712844028101189

If I have , say like , A A plus B f type , it can undergo cross - linking , you can visualize , yourself plus A f plus few B B molecule , then also it can cross link , from cross link , or you can have , if you have A f plus B f molecule , this , all this can form cross - links , cross linking .	2.580035537744536

So , you understand , if I have a poly - functional group , which have functionality more than 2 , 3 or more , then there is a depending upon which reaction system , which are , we are talking about , if there is possibility that it form , it may form cross link .	3.149991024060691

Now , what is a molecular weight distribution ?	7.161190839727315

In this case , I go back this and write the molecular weight distribution again without going into the derivation where X w y X n is given by 1 plus f r p .	3.2480304795805566

You know all the term here , f r p plus 1 minus r p square and at r is equal to 1 , p is 1 .	3.0219967890836603

This X w X n , which is the polydispersity index will land up 1 plus 1 f .	4.52462944495069

So , that is your molecular weight distribution .	6.738254036524042

If f is 1 , molecular weight distribution would be , say , if I take this molecule , just one , one of functional group and obviously , it will be , we discussed that earlier , it will be like a linear polymerization with presence of small amount of monofunctional group .	3.5138244041786284

If A , A f is 2 , physical A and A , it will be , it will be much narrow distribution .	4.1886800045715935

If f is 1 , then it will be , if the distribution is like this , if the distribution is like this , for f is 1 , if I increase f , it will be narrower .	3.7049693374939725

If f is 3 , it will become even narrower .	5.897646735133897

So , this f is 1 , f is 2 , f is 3 .	4.544231393758444

So , when you have more and more branching in this case , the chains are the dispersion the , the polymer chains are having lower and lower poly dispersity .	4.574848621554893

So , basically in this case , low molecular weight chain are not present in that amount and that number if there was no this multifunctional poly - functional group .	3.3230120925764903

Now , what will be the poly number of , average number of molecular weight in the second case , this one ?	5.331031530416494

Let us go and try to derive that .	4.232822716971952

Now , for simplicity , let us start with , I have a system where A is to be , to functional group , that is the simplest thing we have been discussing , they are in equal number , so 1 is to 1 .	3.61132176380927

So , and also we define a term f average , which is the average number of functional groups present per molecule , per molecule , which will be given by N i f i total n i , if n i is the , n i is number of molecules having f i functional , fi functional groups .	3.221067392795875

So , that is , that we are defining this term and we are assuming for simplicity , that , this is the condition we are having .	4.806258253749915

Now , let us consider that N 0 is the number of molecules at t is equal to 0 .	3.421396939326405

At the beginning , N 0 is number of molecules .	5.941235002931581

So , what is the number of functional group ?	6.145227644332907

N 0 multiplied by f average because f average is number of functional groups present per molecule on average .	3.672986632575323

So , that is the number of functional group present at t is equal to 0 .	4.256678310964785

Also , let N is the number of molecule present , molecules present , at the end of the reaction what will be X n ?	4.212471605149267

As you know earlier , that is N 0 by N .	4.433738524081073

Now , we know that N is the number of molecules present .	5.275661715042665

Now , after end of reaction and N 0 was the number of molecules present at the beginning , so how many number of molecules reacted ?	4.4095793568331

How many molecules reacted ?	8.64680233304441

N 0 was number of molecules in the beginning and N is the number of molecules now .	6.242442610544615

So , number of molecules reacted , so number of molecules reacted is N 0 minus N .	5.098418792286273

So , number of functional group reacted , now when one molecule disappears how many number of function group is reacting ?	3.275631989350682

Two functional groups , so number of functional group reacted , groups reacted is twice N 0 by N .	4.016838496110256

So , what is a conversion ?	7.246311509904376

As we talked about , we can rearrange this also to get X n is 2 by 2 minus f average into P .	3.474819330408171

So , in this case , this is X n , this is your P , this is conversion .	3.945347506748565

From this expression we can know , that if f average is higher , more than 2 , then for given P value , given conversion we will get a higher molecular weight , higher degrees of polymerization in comparison to linear polymer .	3.441412324402704

For linear polymer what was there for linear X n was , 1 by 1 minus P .	2.7405962234859063

If you will recollect , see , for a given P , f average is more than 2 , then this number will be higher compared to the X n obtained in linear polymer .	3.3799816946749073

If you talk about P , what happens , that what happen when X n is infinity , when X n can become infinity ?	2.921192315849889

If the reaction , if the molecules in all the chains , now tied up in all the chains , if i have say something like this , polymer chains are growing .	4.083288618664657

Now , I have cross link here , here and there somewhere , somewhere like this , something like this , what is a molecular weight of this polymer ?	3.8022312342344913

These are all , all chains are connected , there is no individual molecular weight if the , all at the point when are complete network formation , that is , when the molecular weight becoming 20 , and that is a point you can visibly see the gel formation .	2.946410429740469

Gel formation means , which is not soluble in the medium , which is insoluble in any solvent , all in bulk as well .	3.681950686112614

So , that when the molecular weight becomes infinity , X n becomes infinity , that means , basically , you have the entire molecular polymers unfrosting to each other .	3.221779199920388

Then the first sign of gel formation happen and we call that as a gel polymer .	3.5098640962339682

So , when molecular weight becomes infinity for the first time at what conversion , that conversion is turned as the gel point .	2.674943466418027

So , what is a gel point ?	7.051872782520452

When X n is infinity , so P c , P critical , which , that , which conversion the , the conversion at which there is a first time of gel formation or the network formation , we call that as gel point and which gives you by , 2 by f average .	2.9232359835955894

We know , that for linear polymerization the infinite molecular happen only when everything is reactive , the , all the monomers are reactive forming a single chain .	2.9038636257150605

It is basically give you an infinitly molecular… So , that happens when P is 1 , but if f average is more than 2 , then at a lower value you can make a gel point and a gel .	2.8826605203093596

Now , from a practical point of you , maybe , I will come in the next lecture , that what is the utility of these branches , branch formation or a cross link formation .	3.4959380586483113

Now , what is , what is the problem in if we have cross link formation or if there could be , in some cases there could be some advantage , some property advantage if we have lightly cross link network present in your polymer system , that I will discuss in the next lecture and with giving you some examples of where this deliberately , this uncross - linking is done to utilize that polymer for a special property .	2.8706358307131032

Now , we almost completed our discussion on the mechanism aspect of the theoretical basis of step polymerization .	3.436227461609323

Now , onwards what we , I am going to discuss is , what is the procession , what are the process condition to make the high molecular rate successful step polymerization .	4.143902012809762

And in next lecture what I am planning is to give the process of synthesizing different step polymers , like polyesters , polycarbonate , and it give you the chemistry of what is the reaction is carried out in real sense , in practical sense , to make this step polymer .	3.5356246586733624

So , next lecture I will complete that discussion on step polymerization .	4.290777947536918

Now , let us begin with , let us see what is a process ?	4.543813352800356

What are the process conditions required for a successful step polymerization ?	4.173977968390366

We have seen , that during are discussions we have covered everything now .	3.725260064125502

We have mentioned everything , now I am just summarizing one after one point , so that I will give you complete picture , what are the parameters , what are the conditions you must have in place , so that we make a successful higher molecular weight step polymer .	3.464587049576579

Let us go and see point by point and the slide first , that reaction rates , you know , reaction rates are generally slow for this poly , step polymers in typically rate constant are of the order of 10 to the power 3 liter mole inverse second inverse , which is very low .	2.244647702165292

So , it cannot be done at room temperature .	6.03341842413911

So , high temperature is required at typically 150 degree to say , 250 degree centigrade is the temperature , is typically applied or this temperature where the polymerization is carried out .	3.5326455896523647

So , high temperature is required to , to facilitate , to make the reaction faster .	4.061021073990856

And you also know from our kinetics , we the kinetics .	4.678483620581569

Remember , that the molecular weight was proportional to , related to the initial monomer concentration N 0 .	5.293046367705848

We can recollect there , which means , that this always preferred to a step polymerization with high monomer concentration , which means , that if you are doing it in a solution , then you do it in a higher concentration and if it is possible to do in a bulk where we have only the monomers and the catalyst , that is the preferred situation .	4.498902752778478

Next , we know , that to make a high molecular weight , P should be close to 1 , the conversion , the conversion and from kinetics discussion we have seen , that to have P close to 1 , very high number , we have to continue the reaction for a longer time .	3.4441915033359973

There is no other , there is no , no other alternate rules by which we can achieve P very high , close to 1 without , you know , keeping the reaction for a longer time ; there is no other rules .	2.986403352009559

We have to keep the reaction , or continue the reaction for a longer time to have the P value close to 1 , which means , that if you have some monomer or the resulting polymer or oligomer are not thermally stable .	3.742306423063809

Then , it is a problem , that those might degrade and generate some impurities in the polymer , which can generate color or which can degrade the polymer in later stage and , and it will not give you , not give you the properties , which you are looking for from that polymers .	3.6215993512750515

So , it is , it is always preferred , that thermally stable polymers , the thermally stable polymers should be utilized in the polymerization .	3.4400893996020856

And if you know also , that if it is in high temperature and if there is a presence of oxygen , then thermo duration is a , is a very feasible way of degrading any organic molecules .	3.5332734065415736

So , it is always preferred , that reaction if possible , should be done in an inert atmosphere , like nitrogen atmosphere , argon atmosphere , so that you are taking away the possibility or minimize , or minimizing the possibility of oxidative , thermo - oxidative degradation of the monomer or the resulting oligomer or polymer molecules .	2.6758442652505052

Next point is , you know , stoichiometric ratio r should be close to 1 .	3.3294904729107504

We have seen that when r is not close to 1 , the molecular rate becomes slower .	4.895100736900319

Now , to have r is close to 1 , you first have to know the purity of the monomer and if there is an impurity , you do not know what you are putting in the reaction .	4.1358105600713

So , it is always advisable , it is always preferred and always industrial , it is always done to have monomer , which are extremely pure , very pure , so that you know what you are putting if you are adding two monomers .	3.196715481685105

Assuming , that they are close to 1is to one or whatever target molecular rate you are looking for , that has to be the same what you are giving .	4.7112652759415745

That means , the monomers has to be very pure and you know , if required , you can change the ratio r slightly .	3.575557667395235

Put one of them in excess , so that the molecular weight is controlled if you have some molecular weight in your target and that can also be done by adding small molecules , small amount of monofunctional molecules .	4.473453146681787

You have also seen , that equilibrium are very , equilibrium is , equilibrium consideration are also very important , prime important .	2.686644678456014

We , we have seen , that in the most cases , this poly are step polymers , are equilibrium reaction .	4.740900239088687

So , to have the product formation you have to take out the small molecular rate , condense it out of the system .	4.467174295708603

You have to write that out by applying a low pressure , that will affect in vacuum and high temperature and so that your reaction proceed towards the product side , towards the polymers side .	2.6982236230201555

You have also seen , that it is always preferred , that you have a higher k value , higher equilibrium constant .	4.204937438273488

Now , what happens if you have higher k ?	7.6285246441770145

Then for , for given polymer , for targeting same polymer molecular weight it can actually live with the small amount of , mono , more amount of condensate in the system if you have comparing into reaction having one , having higher equilibrium constant .	3.0608242804222554

So , it is always preferred , that you take out as much as condensate as possible by your system , by your technique and also , you also design the monomers , so that reactivity is higher and so the equilibrium constant is higher .	2.997323951235986

Next point is , no or minimum side reaction .	4.256583095310936

We know , that this side reactions cyclic formation , if cyclic formation takes place too much time , they will come out of the reaction and your goes up .	3.998336791677457

If your side reaction is forming some molecules , which act as a chain stopper , which is like act as end of mono - functional group , if your side reactions are producing some molecules , which are mono - functional , which act as chains stopper , then it will harm your building up the molecular .	2.758346330764073

It will stop the molecule there itself .	4.9258366800685085

And as we have seen , that to reduce the cyclic formation , cyclic molecules formation , it is preferred , that we do the reaction in high concentration of monomer .	3.448124054199079

We have seen just now , that in earlier today , that it is always preferred to have a monomer present in high concentration , so that we can reduce the cyclic formation .	4.077919717754058

We have also seen that is important , that we have the functional groups present in the .	6.193562341072927

During the reaction if some molecules oligomer are forming , which are say , precipitate out of the solution , if you are doing the reaction in a solution , if the oligomer precipitate out , then the functional groups are not available to reaction .	3.5558141911261645

Now , the two other things are thermal management because polymerization reactions are exothermic .	3.1250687204028744

And next point is managing the high viscosity .	4.2662960651884125

As we progress , the molecular rate goes up and again , fortunately , the molecular rate goes up to high , very high level at the end of the polymerization and on the P is very high .	3.9292623531088124

So , except the , when except the situation is , P is very high , the viscosity of medium remains manageable and at the high viscosity in , at the high conversion in a time frame the polymer goes up and viscosity also goes up .	3.2042119284791224

So , we need to have very good mechanism , so that the , the can be exposed to the vacuum you are applying , so that you can push the reaction towards the product side .	3.1814126395787996

Now , let us , you , you follow all the , let us , you follow all the , all this , everything , all this points , which we covered in , in last 5 , 10 minutes , you , you follow exactly all the things according to my direction or according to direction given in a book and end of the reaction , you find , that there is no molecular builder , it just forms oligomer .	2.3381849885122583

So , you , you think , that whatever I am just talking is , is not correct or whatever is written in the book is not correct , you might think that way , but it is not you have to think little higher .	3.0192479197664794

Then where this , your experience comes , your experience of polymers synthesis terms , what we will do ?	2.743050583154364

We will start from that point that even if you follow the requirement of successful step polymerization , here could be some other reasons , which you need to , you know , be careful , so that you have a successful buildup of high molecular weight in a step polymers polymerization process .	3.43644484466163

So , we will visit , we just this we will just begin with that in the next lecture and complete at the module on step growth polymerization by looking at the synthetic procedure of the several step polymers .	3.0624142059406108

So far we have been talking about the status of enzyme technology as is being practiced in the industries as for the application of enzymes are concerned in different sectors of their application .	2.86539259531239

The issues that I will be talking today are ones which are still posing challenge and are restricted to laboratory investigations so far and it is likely that some of them in a very short time will come out as industrial processing concepts .	3.210454302086109

First issue that I want to draw your attention is the bio processing with co - factor linked enzymes .	3.0674234808801657

As I mentioned earlier that a large number of enzymes that are known are mediated through co - enzymes or co - factors as you know and most of the applications that we talked earlier , they related to only hydrolytic enzymes which do not require co - factors with the sole exception of glucose isomerase which is an isomerase and it also does not require co - factor .	2.8799176940905054

The large number of cofactor linked enzymes therefore opens a big challenge to the industry or to the scientist who are concerned with the diversification of application of enzymes .	2.717135197536442

The basic motivation or rational for the use of co - factor linked enzymes comes from the function of living cell in which a number of co - factor linked enzymes are operational in various metabolic path ways which are used by cells for carrying out their various catabolic as well as anabolic reactions .	2.8422300468196875

The basic concept in a living cell , when it comes to cofactor linked enzymes , relates to cycling of the cofactor between two enzyme catalyzed reactions .	2.628355460416899

The two enzyme catalyzed reactions are coupled in a cell in such a way that the cofactor which is used in one direction is recycled back through another reaction with which it is linked and the total equilibrium is in favor of the desired intermediate the direct part to be synthesized by the cell .	2.639169274929387

As far as their industrial application is concerned the issue is restricted to mainly three issues : one is that the coenzyme and the enzyme must be retained in the reactor .	3.233970292051624

We have seen in our earlier deliberations where we have talked about immobilized enzymes that the enzyme can be retained in the reactor and used over a long period of time .	3.220720249469774

A similar concept has to be developed for co - enzyme retention in the reactor .	4.054821977407337

Although it is little more difficult in the sense that while enzymes provide you a large molecular size as well as a number of functional groups on the molecule which can be used for coupling to matrix where the required enzyme is a small molecular weight compound not such a large molecule and also the number of functional groups available on the molecule are very restricted .	3.366229508934589

So exactly the same concept may not be applied , but still one needs to retain the co - enzyme so that it is not consumed during the reaction .	3.567832205965414

The basic concept to retain the enzyme as listed here is the use of the water soluble polymer bound coenzyme .	3.9198456987319665

For retention of the coenzyme we use instead of a small molecular weight coenzyme , a water soluble polymer bound coenzyme .	3.2525930942494723

Because of binding purposes we add another functional group which can be used for coupling to a water soluble polymer which may not be present on the original coenzyme as it is and therefore you need an analogue .	3.6420590490671594

When I say analogue I am referring to some chemical and structural modifications but the role of coenzyme is retained by the molecule .	2.773097883008979

The second issue is regeneration of the coenzyme .	4.647926108011494

The regeneration of the co - enzyme like in a living cell can be carried out by coupling to enzyme catalyzed reaction , as you see here .	4.253884685103187

In a membrane reactor in which a reaction has to be carried out , I illustrate a general redox reaction , AH plus B going to A plus BH .	3.1753971650537944

If this co - enzyme is NAD , this has to be coupled to a polymer so that the coenzyme is not lost during use .	4.142899181788957

Another important feature is that the product needs to be separated to drive the coupled reaction and the separation of product is mediated by use of membrane reactor in which the high molecular weight enzyme as well as the coenzyme , which is now made to be high molecular weight , is retained in the reactor and thereby the product can be separated from the reaction mixture and the reaction can be driven in the desired direction .	3.6780262962476584

I will illustrate the point with one of the examples .	5.780534510847932

There is lot of chemistry involved because different people have proposed different kind of chemical reactions .	2.824950419446859

I am not interested to give you detailed chemistry .	5.302919186468348

Just to explain the concept for example you take polyacrylamide , which is a water soluble polymer .	4.545062925376882

This is derivatised by hydrogen hydrate to polyacrylamide hydrazide and this polyacrylamide hydrazide then is coupled to a co - enzyme NAD which is derivatised in the form of carboxymethyl NAD .	2.440535779205033

So therefore a carboxymethyl group is generated here and carboxymethyl NAD is then activated by carbodiimide , the reaction which you are familiar , with the carboxylic group containing enzymes by activation by carbodiimide and therefore you get an activated co - enzyme molecule .	2.6045400302704813

A carboxymethyl which is NAD analogue is activated using carbodiimide under acidic conditions to give you an activated NAD .	2.850967486435709

This activated NAD is coupled with the polyacrlyamide hydrazide and this on coupling gives you a water soluble large molecular weight coenzyme analogue which is functionally compatible with the dehydrogenase which you want to use and similar systems can be designed for use .	2.6058159959592624

This describes a typical laboratory setup in which a stirred cell type of ultra filtration system has been used .	2.9207745585746725

A is the feed reservoir ; it is passed through a valve which can direct the reaction vessel either to the reservoir or to the cylinder for pressure .	2.5328376874081218

It can have both the directions and the reaction can be carried out high pressure and the reactor contains the polymer bound co - enzyme , the substrate and the two enzymes .	3.464646122632368

Two of the reactions which have been carried in such a reactor is one is continuous oxidation of ethanol using permeabilized yeast cells .	3.7188818562593573

That means it has lost its permeability barriers for substrate and product exchange .	3.4748532917207977

In fact it has shown to give some kind of enzymatic activity which can be called as NADH oxidase ; it oxidizes the reduced NAD into oxygen like an oxidase activity and it generates hydrogen peroxide and this hydrogen peroxide to break down requires peroxidase or else it will inactivate the original enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase .	2.236120911353071

In the same reactor system if you use ethanol , polyacrylamide hydrazide coupled NAD and peroxidase you can get a net conversion oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and the profiles shown here give you the kind of reaction progress .	2.9693835792846315

This is reaction progress in hours .	5.0286825547836145

In the first profile there is no peroxidase added which means as soon as the reaction starts the hydrogen peroxide produced inactivates the alcohol dehydrogenase and no further reaction takes place .	2.9604635803248986

Only when you add hydrogen peroxide , here hydrogen peroxide or peroxidase has been added , you get the reaction going on to a sizable extent until the time again because of some reasons either the enzyme has leaked out and the alcohol concentration again builds up and there is no reduction .	2.8111922615871743

In third case the system was improved by treatment of the alcohol dehydrogenase containing cells by glutaraldehyde which is aimed to fix the alcohol dehydrogenase on to some cellular organelles and there by making it almost in the form of an immobilized enzyme so that it doesn ’ t leak out and you can see the clear advantage that the reaction is extended over a large period of time comparatively but again still it goes and although this system can be demonstrated for eight hours or ten hours but still there are some problems which are still so far not understood as to what happens in the case of cofactors cycling .	2.4964938301622155

The concentration of NAD here is very , very small and therefore the cycling is taking place ; there is no doubt .	4.463394044857604

But because you are ultimately here reducing the concentration let us say from hundred milli molar to an extent of about seventy milli molar which means thirty milli molar concentration has been reduced which means that in a NAD concentration of let us say ten milli molar , seven hundred cycles have taken place .	2.439156504408137

A similar profile is observed in the case of conversion of pyruvate to alanine using same polyacrylamide hydrazide coupled NAD and formate dehydrogenase and alanine dehydrogenase .	2.603296294599656

As I mentioned the use of format dehydrogenase has an advantages that the reaction products are carbon dioxide and water which can be easily stripped off but you have to provide formate as a substrate along with it and the circles indicate no glutaraldehyde treatment and the triangles is with glutaraldehyde which very clearly indicates that the down fall is prevented and the enzyme is available over a longer period of time and reaction continues .	2.5704554647675337

But the data beyond sixteen hours have not been shown here but within a couple of hours definitely not more than twenty four hours it is able to say and the reactor performance drops down .	2.605616783198533

The second issue was to recall bio processing of unnatural substrate .	2.949715169582406

Here we had highlighted that there are a number of enzyme reactions which although give you lot of benefits , very favorable concepts , in terms of their specificity , in terms of the desired nature of the product they produce in the right stereoisomeric form but still the problem is also in relation to the never specificity gives you a much more problem .	3.230364322120563

If you look at the two reactions that I referred to earlier that is conversion of fumaric acid to malic acids and also maleic acid to aspartic acid .	2.5101943951783316

Malic acid is directly used in most of the beverages as the acidulant and aspartic acid , the bulk use is in synthesis of aspartane but the quantity required is not very large .	2.857921292507949

On the other hand look at similar reactions which are of commercial value and in large quantity .	2.9401714405161776

They are just representative reactions ; there are many more reactions which come under this category .	3.0376747297413833

You see lactic acid to acrylic acid .	4.54127317409905

Removal of water molecule from lactic acid is reverse of what fumarase does and this reaction is of immense value and if it can be carried out it can serve a great purpose .	2.9832150363741605

Similarly extraction of water from ethanol to give ethylene or dehydration of ethanol .	2.8703904677890963

Then again extraction of water from 1,3 - butanediol to produce 1,3 - butadiene which is a substrate or monomer for synthetic rubber .	3.3491315368584047

All the three substrates which are listed here are bulk fermentation products .	3.756588402130722

If they can transform enzymatically using an enzyme something similar to that of fumerase or a modified fumerase probably one can have very significant impact on the enzyme technology .	2.713472320036743

Such efforts are drawing attention of people so that we can design enzymes reactions to meet the requirements .	3.0570868017056387

In general although the enzymes catalyse very desirable chemical transformations like fumaric acid to malic acid or maleic acid to aspartic acid but often they convert only substrate that have limited commercial interest .	1.9421798404108364

In fact if these enzymes can be used for those conversions which have very varied and very large commercial interest the impact will be much greater and one can be really fascinated with the industrial application of enzymes .	2.6754176191024897

Other feature was people tend to accept the enzyme names very literally and in absolute sense .	2.4343116427092886

When we name glucose oxidase we interpret that glucose is a substrate with oxygen as the ultimate lactone acceptor for oxidation of glucose .	2.3836372491795284

Similarly galactose oxidase also is in the same concept but in practice these enzymes are not so highly specific .	4.049246525583087

They have very narrow specificity and we need to broaden their specificity .	4.3839045087463555

On the other hand we have certain enzymes which are broadly specific which are not very narrowly specific but we are not able to use them for variety of reactions .	3.457537339325426

Glucose will get oxidized and the corresponding electron acceptor will get reduced and one can carry out a number of organic chemical transformations .	3.5089585434752255

Galactose oxidase is another enzyme which is known to catalyse the classical reaction of galactose to the corresponding aldehyde by oxygen .	2.9249461553313854

But this galactose oxidase is a very broad …… applicable enzyme and it really acts on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols to give rise to corresponding aldehydes and these aldehydes , the conversion of alcohol to aldehydes oxidation reactions , are of great significance in perfumery and cosmetic industry and a number of reactions can be catalyzed .	2.4496347090888393

One thing you must be sure is that the rates on different substrates might be different .	4.44196488672833

Today with an understanding of the site directed mutagenesis , it is possible to change the substrate specificity and also improve the catalytic functional rates .	3.100637734313152

So the message is that in addition to the natural reactions catalyzed by enzymes there is always a range of non - natural reactions that are of commercial interest .	3.107016432157298

The challenge is to unfold and link these non - natural reactions for the enzyme available in bulk quantities .	3.145815192946299

Another feature is first we must pay attention to those enzymes which are already available in bulk quantities .	3.0643863267865346

Because one would like to look at a particular bio transformation but if the enzyme is not available in bulk quantity at a low cost the application may be inhibitory ; may not be feasible .	3.568069464326697

So best is to initially look at those enzymes which are available in large quantities and one can only diversify their application to a large range of non - natural reactions which are of commercial value and this will require very clear understanding of their reaction mechanism because presently those reactions are being carried out by chemical transformations and making use of the reaction mechanism one can probably think of certain unconventional reactions .	2.6828738566435493

The third interesting area which I wanted to talk was bio - organic synthesis using enzymes in micro - aqueous medium .	2.3878600328871062

Normally we understand that enzymes are operable in aqueous medium and the basic reason is that a large number of non - covalent interactions that we are familiar with enzyme structure are through interaction of the enzyme protein with the water molecule and water is a requisite specie in the case of maintenance of a confirmation of an enzyme molecule and to carry out the chemical or bio chemical reactions .	3.3191768128316332

Such a perception in the earlier days was based on a very limited understanding of the enzyme structure and function and the limited understanding was that people had looked at the stability of the enzyme in water miscible solvents say for example acetone which is still used for precipitation of enzyme proteins ; it makes aggregates and precipitates ; dioxanes which are water miscible solvents and beyond certain concentration of these solvents in the bulk medium inactivates the enzyme .	2.5863574886144036

Now people understood that enzymes cannot be used in the non - polar environment which ultimately proved wrong in atleast for the last twenty years and people have looked at a number of water immiscible solvents which are known to keep enzyme in a very stable confirmation along with the maintenance of enzyme confirmation because the quantity of water required for interaction with the enzyme protein is a very small bound water molecule around the external surface of the molecule which is retained and which is not very easy to be removed by normal dehydration methods .	3.196898019698412

Unless you subject it to chemical treatments you cannot really remove it by conventional drying methods the bound water present in the enzyme molecule .	3.0900045406737804

In the recent years number of applications have already emerged but on a limited scale and probably the scope it offers is much , much larger than it is being practiced today .	2.4510993684637943

Some of the advantages of organic media for bio - catalysis are : one is many of the reactions which require non - polar substrates lipids mainly are very difficult to carry out in aqueous medium because they are not soluble or the concentration that will be soluble will be very small .	3.2992708038294936

So if you want to carry out those reactions in high concentration you need a non - polar bulk medium and the substrate can be dissolved and then they can be used for enzymatic catalysis .	3.593110725961759

Another major advantage is the hydrolysis can catalyse synthetic reactions .	3.746957094545296

That means in the absence of water for hydrolysis which require water as a second substrate or for hydrolysis reaction water is the reactant .	2.751325390725624

If the water is stripped off or is not present then the reaction can go in the reverse direction and instead of hydrolysis , synthesis can be used and in fact it is in this area a very significant application have emerged where the ester synthesis has been carried out even commercially in fact for some of the very high value products .	3.0329792379877594

Particularly , more importantly for resolution of racemic mixtures which we know that the enzymes are able to recognize one of the isomers the resolution can be carried out in the case of chemically synthesized racemic mixture .	3.555641828972029

Then many of these can be used for modification of enzyme specificity as far as the reaction is concerned in the organic medium .	4.669934040123059

It has been also seen that when you subject enzyme molecule into anhydrous organic solvent the enzyme becomes very rigid .	3.198195913484226

If you put an enzyme molecule into aqueous media , in buffer the molecule in highly mobile .	3.133510590168362

It interacts with the water molecule freely and it is very mobile but when you put in organic non - polar medium its mobility is drastically reduced .	3.365112881281203

In fact one of the major Scientist working in this area he has called these as rocks in the organic solvent .	2.7982436116758644

The molecule becomes so rigid that the structure is very rigid and deactivation is impossible .	2.9223883845649268

The molecule becomes rigid ; it doesn ’ t deactivate it retains its activity and that is one of the advantage and during this rigidification lot of modification in the substrate specificity also occurs and this has been noted in many cases and coincidentally bulk of the studies in use of enzymes in the non - polar medium has been in the area of hydrolases mainly lipase and proteases .	2.7557421436715455

They are the two classes of enzymes lipases and proteases which have been extensively studied for variety of reactions .	3.440416916245781

I will illustrate with some of the examples .	6.60964837451736

Then reduction of side reactions catalyzed by water .	5.5357656066720855

When water is not present any reaction catalyzed by water is inhibited .	3.5212521970520787

Then higher stability both thermal stability and no problems with microbial contamination because the solvent itself will act as a preservative and not allow any microbial contamination to take place and the enzyme can be stored over a long period of time .	2.426521384439032

Even operational stability is improved ; as I mentioned that the confirmation becomes very rigid .	3.9207967068111986

It ’ s not possible to alter it during reaction and the mobility is lost .	3.6644028894542977

Another major important factor is better integration with the chemical steps in synthetic sequence where you want to use enzyme as a part of a sequence of reactions in an organic chemical synthesis where the substrate is coming already dissolved in organic solvent you can always integrate enzymatic reaction in the sequence of steps .	2.9647510827602184

Some of the alternative ways in which enzymes can be used in the organic solvent are shown here .	3.823211876107933

If you look at the first one , the ‘ A ’ , it is a homogeneous system containing individual enzyme molecules , water and water miscible organic solvent .	3.168565897589727

Typical example is acetone , water mixture .	5.046548673974453

You take ethanol water mixture put the enzyme carry out the reactions .	3.697505916800257

Such a system practically is not very , very attractive because as I mentioned they tend to inactivate the enzyme because water miscible solvents often tend to extract the bound water layer of the enzyme and thereby the confirmation is disturbed .	3.015700180586091

The second is the use of enzyme in two phase systems ; an organic and water two phase systems where the enzyme is present in the aqueous phase , the substrate is present in the non - aqueous phase ; make an emulsion by agitation or use of surfactant , bring the enzyme and the substrate in close proximity and then carry out the reaction .	3.1367739706824973

In the third configuration .	8.221740064354051

‘ C ’ , the enzyme is immobilized on water containing porous particles surrounded by organic solvents .	3.4173939055929163

That means you use a hydrophilic support and the hydrophilic support will contain the enzyme particle immobilized along with some water molecules dispersed around it and the whole particle is then immersed as shown in a magnified way here .	2.5427107030197496

The enzyme particles which are hydrophilic contain the water molecules around the enzyme and they are suspended in the bulk organic medium .	4.2009897752665015

The shaded portion indicates the organic medium and the blank spaces are indicated by water medium and the enzyme particles are marked E .	3.3570074397518086

The fourth configuration is the immobilization of the enzyme particle on a hydrophobic matrix .	4.94179607762327

There is no water present in the proximity of the enzyme molecule and the hydrophobic matrix and the enzyme is immobilized in a hydrophobic patch and it is suspended then in the organic solvent .	3.9094437463861746

The fifth one is solid enzyme particles suspended directly .	3.4730069650290964

You take enzyme particle , dry it and suspend into solvent and because they are not soluble they will tend to form lumps , aggregates that is what these aggregates are shown and they can be used to carry out the reaction .	2.966515957574577

Then the sixth one is you make reverse micelle by use of surfactant .	3.3753365649008673

You take enzyme in the micro emulsion form and inside the reverse micelle you have the enzyme entrapped in the water cells .	3.7394405228465004

That means the enzyme experiences an atmosphere which is hydrophilic in nature but the whole reverse micelle is surrounded by the organic solvent .	2.4167764221046575

This is the enzyme entrapped in the reverse micelle .	6.456765056695745

Reverse micelle is just like water in oil emulsion where by you have enzyme entrapped .	3.146750754038303

Within the reverse micelle the amphipathic molecules make a structure where by all the hydrophobic tails extrude outwards towards the bulk organic solvent and the polar heads are all made into a small network within which the enzyme particle is trapped and some water is also entrapped within the cell and therefore the enzyme remains stable almost as if it is experiencing an aqueous phase .	2.579094678799571

But the whole particle , as a micelle particle is immersed in the organic phase .	3.662926810751503

Then you have the last configuration in which enzyme is modified by chemical modification so as to be made soluble in the non - aqueous phase .	3.6559634968063683

One of the well known reported methods is modification of enzyme by coupling to polythene glycol .	2.9016553140523893

If you couple polythene glycol , the whole enzyme molecule becomes soluble in non - aqueous phase and then it can be put into an organic medium and then it behaves almost like a soluble enzyme but in non - aqueous phase .	3.5614195796220907

But again doing covalent modification of this enzyme , you loose lot of activity and there might be some change in the conformation so as to alter substrate specificity in the process .	2.868727130261011

If you look at the structural understanding of the enzyme what happens when we immobilize either on hydrophilic or hydrophobic matrix ?	3.405812098380819

Most of the enzymes in organic phase are used in immobilized form .	5.027300444730507

If you look here this is a free soluble enzyme .	5.7546735991655

As I mentioned earlier the enzyme molecule is surrounded by water layer and this water layer is essential for the enzyme conformation and activity .	3.326192918424014

When the bulk solvent is water and the continuous phase is water there is no disturbance on this surrounding layer and the enzyme remains stable for a reasonable period of time .	2.9382942042852815

When you immobilize the enzyme on to a solid matrix , let us say a polymeric matrix , it could be hydrophilic or hydrophobic matrix you generate an interphase with the bulk medium and the polymeric matrix is surrounding the water layer which is maintained during the reaction .	2.643200047510618

No . Bulk here is organic solvent and here it was water .	4.1533826078626745

In the third case it is a reverse micelle .	6.9182280447762725

Here also you have an interphace which consist of hydrophobic tails .	4.147820373551347

Although this provides a very neat system for carrying out enzymatic reaction in organic phase , the only problem is the recovery of the product , after the reaction is over , from the system .	3.2846560944814374

Recovery of product means you need to disrupt the micelle , reform the micelle so the reaction cannot be really carried out in a continuous mode and that causes severe problem , operational problem .	2.7810795810905162

But otherwise as a system if you look at this provides you an ideal system because it gives you very large interphase ; it gives you a hydrophobic interface which can remain stable in the …… .	3.2153872066384266

The important parameters for the enzyme reactions in organic solvents are the source and presentation of the enzyme .	4.104535568413974

As I mentioned the variety of forms in which the enzyme can exist either as a free enzyme , immobilized enzyme , soluble conjugate , that is …… enzymes or in microemulsion form either of the way ; that is one parameter and one need to look at the kind of form of the enzyme that gives the best results .	3.1713516403005406

Then the choice of solvent is another feature .	5.034677620467488

It has been noted in most cases that the solvents which are relatively more non - polar are better suited for carrying out enzymatic reaction mainly because of their lack of interaction with the water layer on the enzyme molecule .	3.1614962997758465

In fact people have defined as far as the choice of solvent is concerned a parameter what they call as log P where P is the partitioning coefficient of the solvent between a particular solvent and octenol .	2.830905447321456

Octanol is considered to be the extreme non - polar medium and the partitioning coefficient of that solvent between water and octenol is the P value and higher the log P value means it is more non - polar and higher the log P value the better it is a suited solvent for enzyme catalyst .	3.069212630041609

They do not interact with the essential water layer on the enzyme molecule because of their non - polar nature and therefore the enzyme structure is maintained .	3.678045848330253

A very important factor is amount of water present .	4.61209627153984

Almost all the reactions when we want to carry out in organic solvent we also need a very small quantity of water which plays a key role in the catalytic function of the enzyme .	4.087532812668125

It is a question of debate whether this amount of water required is to maintain the essential water layer in equilibrium or there are some other catalytic functions which require water molecules by the enzyme because so far if you look into reaction mechanisms of enzymes excepting for maintaining the enzymes structure , water has not been seen to play any role .	2.3601272908910125

But once if we say that you have a very high log P value of the solvent which has no miscibility with the water it will not disturb the essential water layer but still a small quantity of water is required in the organic solvents to maintain the catalytic function and there are number of approaches which has been made to provide that small quantity of water and also to strip the water produced in the reaction .	3.4264550046857667

When you talk of hydrolysis being used in the reverse direction for synthetic purposes water will be produced and this water needs to be essentially removed .	2.8790250658321237

On the other hand there is an optimum water concentration which is required but when water is produced water has to be removed rather being added .	3.19015066519183

Then pH is another feature .	6.80623069586005

When you carry out the enzyme reaction in an organic solvent the role of pH becomes limited in the sense that as we saw earlier in the effect of pH in enzyme kinetics , the major role was ionization of the amino acid residues in the enzyme protein .	3.7884143039160425

A non - polar solvent will not really allow ionization to take place and therefore pH theoretically must not play any role .	2.8779163284898797

But the role of pH in the case of enzyme reaction in organic solvents has a different connotation and the connotation is that it has been reported by some workers that enzymes unlike many other small molecular weight chemical compounds possess a memory with respect to certain physical features say for example pH .	3.256083520592843

For dispersing the enzyme into an organic solvent you are starting from enzyme which is already dispersed in some aqueous medium and whatever pH was of that medium , the enzyme retains that pH in the memory and the functional aspect of the enzyme when it is transferred to non - polar medium remains at the same pH .	3.073170236136267

So you can make different enzyme preparations starting from initial pH in the water medium which have different functional capabilities and by changing the enzyme memory with respect to pH .	2.9960892920562308

Similarly temperature and nature of substrate also are important parameters and they have the similar features as we saw in the case of water in aqueous medium .	3.509214197167301

Just to illustrate one of the reaction system which we did some work here in IIT itself and the enzyme reactors systems were developed here and used for a number of reactions which I have skipped .	3.7035362112678354

In fact for calibration of the humidifiers we use saturated salt solution and each salt , when you make a saturated salt solution has definite relative humidity and those salts are circulated so as to maintain a constant water activity in the reactor and even control water activity .	2.5063962950933347

That means this saturated salt solution if more water is produced will take up water and when water will get depleted it will act almost like a water buffer just like a buffer for acids and bases , this acts like a buffer and one can control water activity in organic reaction system and carry out the reaction at a constant water activity .	2.385403195482677

Proteases for peptide synthesis , oxidases for variety of reactions for example cholesterol to cholestenone , butanol to butanaldehyde , p - phenylphenol to phenol - formaldehyde resins , p - cresol to o - quinone and ethanol to hydrogen peroxide .	1.9889030969981358

Even transferase have been used in organic medium for sucrose to levan , a polymer and glucose to fructose isomerisation has been shown to shift the equilibrium constant from fifty percent equimolar in the favor of fructose while when we use in the non - aqueous phase .	2.573661209074383

Last feature is synthetic enzymes in molecular imprinting .	4.061267356748249

We know that the enzymatic catalytic function has two key roles : one is binding of the substrate and then certain catalytic function .	3.342513447906083

So what we need in the case of synthetic enzyme is that we must have kind of a large molecule with a cavity so that a substrate of definite size can fit into it and mimic a binding process .	3.175689678854727

The other is in the proximity of the cavity there must be some functional groups which can do catalyses and we know that the enzymes also follow the same kind of reaction mechanisms as chemical catalysts do or acid base catalysis , covalent catalysis , or proximity effects ; all those there are experienced in the enzymatic reactions and the similar concepts are being used to synthesize large molecules to mimic the catalytic functions .	2.6858052989183863

In fact one of the most successful attempts has been to use cyclodextrins .	3.606893317600157

The cyclodextrins are cyclic molecules with six , seven and eight glucose moieties coupled together in a starch .	2.6185907958427355

That means a - 1 , 4 - glucoside linkage .	5.713994996395287

If you degrade starch you will get dextrins and these dextrins if they are cyclic molecules we call them cyclodextrin and the alpha , beta , gamma cyclodextrins are six , seven and eight glucose molecules linked in the cyclic form .	2.4117048938333676

The peculiar feature of this is that the cyclic molecules make a cavity of definite size in which you can retain the definite molecules and this cyclodextrins are being used to attach by covalent coupling some of the chemical groups which can catalyse the reaction .	3.2449839716665663

If you look at the cavity of cyclodextrin it is almost like a paper and cylinder and on the surface they attach a number of functional groups , the same functional groups which are known to be possessed by and this is for example chymotrypsin analogue .	3.052624423697801

They have tried to mimic the activity of chymotrypsin ; they have named it also benzyme and some of the functional groups are covalently coupled which are functional in the case of catalysis and such a complex is called a synthetic enzyme .	2.986990097232357

Many such molecules are likely to come out .	5.742956125667288

But so far not many synthetic enzymes are available which can carry out diverse function as the normal natural catalyst do .	2.7765415007570877

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

In today ’ s lecture , we will continue our discussion which we started on determination of polymer molecular weight .	3.250536134866624

And today basically , we will continue our discussion ; we had started on gel permeation chromatography or size exclusion chromatography and then briefly discussed mass spectroscopy of polymers in particularly MALDI TOF MS .	2.8800833336733693

Now , this is the last slide we had stopped in last lecture .	4.507619680760787

Now , this is the typical GPC trace where in the y axis you have detector response and in x axis typically you have elution time , and which can easily become what is in to elution volume .	2.726384581500986

Now , from this raw data we must transform this data as a weight fraction molecular weight distribution which is a plot of weight fraction versus molecular weight .	2.9127352680424154

The requirement for this type of transformation is this , because we know the definition of M n is given by where w is the weight fraction of a polymer chain having molar mass of M i and we can express this in terms of an integral form like this .	3.8902111677969833

So , basically we need to plot this weight fraction distribution against molecular weight to integrate this which will give us M n .	3.66437883505671

Similarly , M w weight average molecular weight can be obtained from the formula .	4.827661556125859

So , basically this is example of M n and M w expressed in integral form ; this shows why we require the raw data to be transformed in this type of weight fraction molecular distribution with plot of weight fraction versus molecular weight .	2.50022508988966

Now , to do that , let us first look at the principle of the separation in gel permeation chromatography .	4.4652988900548305

Remember , we have discussed in the last lecture that you have in gel permeation chromatography the polymers are passed through a columns containing beads which have definite pores .	3.7637200637278956

Now , what happens ?	10.490465922679894

How the separation happens ?	8.347109406560012

The flow rate we typically work the GPC ’ s work like in the range of 1 ml per minute .	3.0917008561711525

It is has been that the elution volume does not depend up on the flow rate which means that the polymer samples are not carried away or dragged away by this solvent molecules ; the polymer molecules basically equilibrate between the pores inside and outside , and the higher molecular bonds are resides most of the times outside the pores whereas the smaller molecular what are more size polymer molecules they partition more inside the pore volume ; thus taking longer time to elute .	2.524138476416232

If we express this mathematically little bit and see what is happening .	3.9472333780347353

See if we consider the elution volume V e for a particular polymer sample as V 0 plus K s c into V i where V 0 is the volume outside the pores whereas , V i is the total volume inside the pores ; and K is K s c is the equilibrium constant which basically is given by the concentration of the polymer sample inside divided by concentration sample outside the pores .	3.4443513414958975

So , for very large size polymer chains which has a larger size does not penetrate in the pore size .	3.623524381824093

So , K s c is 0 .	8.037568648274345

So , V e is given by the outside volume and if the polymer is low , the size is very small then almost exclusively they will enter the pores and K s c will be 1 which gives us V e is V 0 plus V i .	3.308551604002331

Now , as we know that in gel permeation chromatography there is no interaction between the polymer molecules and the pores or the column there is no interaction between them .	4.395112166161802

So , the value of del H for pore penetration must be 0 .	4.126955952233719

Hence K s c would be given by e to the power del S 0 p p by R .	4.653563179462442

Now , for a flexible chain it can be statistically shown as this entropy for pore penetration given by this expression where A s is surface area of the pores per unit volume and L dash is the mean molecular projection which is basically given in to diameter for spherical polymer chain which is basically related to size of the polymer .	2.8791735328385473

Now , as you can think that when a polymer molecule goes inside the pores the conformational entropy of the polymer chain get reduced , because the sum of the conformations which requires the central mass to be very closer to the rigid walls of this pores are forbidden which means the conformational entropy of the polymer molecules reduced or get decreased when a polymer molecule goes inside the pores .	2.7600650987414785

And this reduction of entropy becomes more permanent if you have a large size polymer or if you have a small size pore .	4.045124922779687

So , this entropy of pore penetration is always negative and it becomes more negative if the polymer size grows or the pore size becomes smaller ; and that is expressed by this expression where if the pore size becomes smaller A s goes up ; hence the entropy becomes more negative ; similarly , if the polymers size goes up this becomes higher and this entropy becomes lower .	2.839050545447869

So , if you look at this expression here and we know K s c is this and ESR is this .	3.647183391698733

So , we can simply write from these two , V is V 0 plus V i e to the power minus A s L dash by 2 .	2.83623655269669

So , this is the expression we can write and which shows that V e decreases as decreases with log of polymer size ; log of L hence polymer size .	2.843977703771344

So , this expression tells us that V e decreases linearly with the polymer size goes up V will go down .	3.2620002278607974

So , if we plot log of size against V e you can expect that to be a linear graph .	3.5247290530261157

Now , from Mark Houink and Sakurada equation we know that intrinsic viscosity given by K M to the power a where K and a are constant for a particular polymer solvent temperature combination .	3.210691245319965

So , I can write log eta M is log K plus 1 plus a log M .	3.0524615314610726

Now , remember from our discussion in solution behavior of polymer molecules a polymer size which is basically hydrodynamic volume V h proportional to eta M .	3.681470460491086

We have seen this relations before ; hence we can expect from this and this relation , and whatever we have seen here that log has if the K and a remains constant , log M should linearly decrease with elution volume or V e .	2.5411597018229304

So , we expect that instead of log size if we plot molecular weight we can get linear relationship between V e where elution with the size log M goes up , V e decreases .	3.0535325142181646

Now , this two regions are the exclusion limit and they are the cut off for the two regions where the size goes up beyond this molecular weight then none of the polymer chains can go in .	3.6335058138316563

So , they will have elution volume of V 0 and if polymer size becomes lower and lower , and becomes such a low that all of them can penetrate equally in the pores then all will come at the same time , and this become V 0 plus V i .	2.6244369289474054

So , this is the linear region where the polymers get separated .	4.294372444721585

So , basically from this discussion we can understand that a plot of log M versus elution volume should give a linear relationship and V e should decrease with increase in the log M .	3.0352076223137106

This is what is found in practice when you inject different molecular weight or sample in the GPC column we do actually see that the elution volumes becomes decreases linearly with log M .	2.8514552453566786

And this has been taken advantage to make a calibration curve where known standard very mono dispersed polymers sample which are very low poly dispersity like in this case four samples are shown here .	3.084127086931394

So , they are injected and their elution volumes are recorded and likewise calibration curve is constructed by injecting many mono dispersed polymer sample .	2.140081138776553

So , from this calibration curve we can easily convert this elution volume to log molecular weight data .	3.502436937023257

So , this is the way calibration is done for a GPC ; several mono dispersed polymer sample with known molecular weight are injected in the column and their elution volumes are plotted against log of molecular weight , and such as linear plot is constructed .	2.488823811544457

So , we can remember what the purpose we were trying to convert this raw data to distribution plotting weight fraction versus molecular weight .	2.3733687597740833

Now , from the calibration curve we can convert the elution volume to the molecular weight .	4.018742752777298

Now , what about the detected signal ?	5.013386022927599

Now , for example , if we take a RI detector then this output of this detection signal is proportional to the concentration .	3.4053112986782836

Typically , we use concentration detector .	6.699487300425602

The output will be similar for a given concentration of different molecular weight .	4.144287824583207

So , if we assume that the output does not depend on the concentration , not on the polymer molecular weight ; this is the detector signal and this is the elution volume V e .	4.384777153604121

So , we can simply write the weight fraction d w of the polymer which eluted between V e and V e plus d V e ; we can consider the sample this slice which is very infinitesimal slice .	2.8724087776214233

So , that weight fraction which eluted the polymer between this V e and V e plus d V e .	2.3568447391253438

So , this is again let me repeat this d w is the weight fraction of the polymer chains which eluted between V e and V e plus d V e .	2.8271747713179294

So , this is the weight fraction between the polymer which eluted and they can be written like this where a is the area under this curve ; and if we do interrogation and followed by normalization we can get this weight fraction molecular weight distribution in the form .	4.140390934416583

So , this is mathematically we can do and this wet fraction distribution can be expressed by this formula where this is the detector signal at V e , and this is molecular weight which we got from the calibration curve for this particular V e , and S V e is the magnitude of the slope for this log M versus elution curve plot for that particular point V e .	3.0472068991885184

So , these are the formulas for M w and M n , we have seen in the beginning of this lecture .	3.6346241706616533

So , now , we know what is w M ?	5.722190856273743

How the weight fraction distribution varies with molecular weight ?	4.6577044918551245

So , once we know that with the help of the software this things can be easily calculated .	4.373174489817431

So , we know that from the raw data of GPC trace we can get the number of distribution and weight average molecular weight , and weight molecular rate , and we can also get the other M z , and from the values of K and we can get K v also .	4.136229108181431

So , let us go back and talk more about the calibration .	3.746934491031706

Remember , we did calibration in we have taken mono dispersed standard ; standard means half molecular weight and standards , and then injected , and according to their elution volume , and then for the calibration cut we have plotted log M versus V e elution volume .	2.218715166341677

There are few advantages like this is a simple setup , only one detector is required whether it is a refractive index detector or only one concentration detector and we can do this calibration without knowing exact concentration ; concentration can be variable little bit without no problem and this calibration is very precise and repeatable .	2.7104143689806337

However , there are many disadvantages for this conventional calibration .	4.659758416710455

For example , if we go back and look at this formula remember , we said that as long as this K and a are constant we can write log m instead of log size to construct this calibration curve .	3.113160778445933

So , if the value of K and a changes , and that will change for a different polymer even if we keep the solvent same and temperature same ; if we change the polymers the value of K and a will change ; value of K and hence the intrinsic viscosity will change .	3.200145518695537

So , we will get different curve for a different polymer .	5.326702839057707

So , these calibration curve between log m log of molecular weight and this elution volume is applicable only for a particular polymer whose K and a are constant .	3.279481369544753

Whenever we change K and a for a different polymer ; obviously , we get a new set of calibration .	3.812895798337958

So , this calibration can be obtained used to get a true molecular for weight of polymer .	4.037029146898262

So , this calibration can be used to get true molecular .	4.932900107892549

So , the polymer which are same type used and calibration .	4.170905855147446

So , for example , calibration is done for polystyrene then using this calibration curve we can determine the molecular weight of polystyrene sample only , because the K and a value will remain same for polystyrene only .	2.949933824772165

Instead of polystyrene , if we change it to polycarbonate then K and a value will change .	3.3506091148620243

So , we cannot use this calibration curve , but most of the times we may we use one set of calibration curve for lot of other polymers which gives us error may be 0 to 30 percent error in terms of the molecular weight .	3.016740721673274

Hence , this calibration is mostly done with a mono dispersed synthesized with a precise mono dispersed molecular weight like living anionic polymerization .	2.507094487956562

Typically , this polystyrene , polymethylmethaacrolate they are used as standards for organic solvents , organic soluble polymers and the molecular weights for other polymers are reported agility to polystyrene or polymethylmethaacrolate and for aqua soluble or water soluble polymers ; the standards typically used are say polyethylene oxides which also can be synthesized at very narrow or mono dispersed standards .	2.422055315585051

So , typically the water soluble monomers are reported relative to polyethylene oxides standards .	3.0837265316018256

Second disadvantage is that if the polymers are different in branching like different shapes like branching or other structural modification we cannot also get that difference captured in the calibration .	2.817626777448863

Let us go back and explain with those graphs like if you have repolymers as I explaining for a given molecular weight their sizes could be different depending up on the value of K and a intrinsic viscosity , and they can form a different calibration curve .	3.2375422627772803

So , if you use a calibration curve which is constructed for polymer A and use the same calibration curve for polymer B then these error will be erratic ; that is what we are explaining till now .	2.987978971438984

This is the real example where several polymers are plotted and you can see this each polymer has a different caliber has a unique size to weight relationship .	2.917585439933062

So , if we use one calibration for the other sample there will be error .	4.20817580705946

This is what we are talking about the molecular shapes .	6.207709802287988

Now , for a given molecular rate , if you consider one molecular weight here and keep the molecular weight , and change the shapes like from raw to coil to sphere ; obviously , this sphere will have lowest size then coil then rod .	2.7056544247579066

So , obviously , the elution volume will defer according to size .	3.882355958798304

For a given molecular weight , the shape of the polymer changes like from rod to sphere to coil then the molecular size changes and the elution volume is related molecular size not molecular weight ; hence , the elution volume also changes .	2.8967530387024745

So , this calibration if it is done for linear polymer we cannot use that for other shaped polymer like branched polymer which will have different shape .	3.5943353880115123

So , there are two advantages we must remember using this calibration once that this is always reported with some non - standards gather always some error and if the calibration cub is done with linear polymers if we find or determine molecular weights of other shapes using that calibration cub there will be also error .	2.592463916526738

So , what is done ?	7.699514387078442

To avoid this remember , we talked about again that V h polymer size is proportional to intrinsic viscosity multiplied by molecular weight .	3.2468290361427985

So , if you can find out intrinsic viscosity is a polymer then plot of log eta M , because this gives the polymer size and this elution volume .	3.794774724339973

So , now this is independent of which polymer you are using as long as we are using log of eta multiplied by molecular weight that gives the size of the polymer whether it is a different shape polymer or different type polymer .	3.8530969867577407

So , you get a universal calibration curve .	5.621990909333234

So , if you can construct with one of the polymers say polystyrene then the molecular weight of the other polymer can be also determined using this calibration curve ; as long as we know the intrinsic viscosity for the polymers we are using and the elution volume from our GPC curve .	3.958300108731179

So , as long as we know the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer sample we are using and the elution volume of the sample ; using this universal calibration curve we can get the molecular weight which is fairly accurate .	4.344315992749908

Now , there are other detectors which can be used now a days modern GPC equipment used like viscometer which can detect the intrinsic viscosity on line in a real time and light scattering detector which can determine the weight average molecular weight online , which basically gives us the scope to find out this molecular weight distribution in actual sense .	2.897536284596474

For example , if we have GPC with RI plus light scattering detector , the light scattering gives us the limiting excess Rayleigh ratio delta R theta is equal to 0 and if you are working a very dilute solution we can consider concentration c is equal to 0 .	3.173196471611022

So , from this two , we can get as the samples elute ; we can get the molecular weight data in real time and from RI detection detector we can get the wet fraction automatically .	3.4370557313802643

So , we do not need a calibration curve if we have an absolute molecular weight detector like the light scattering detector .	4.239234592268099

So , that we can get a molecular distribution ; similarly , if we have RI plus viscosity then viscosity real time gives the eta value and then we can use the inverse of calibration curve to find out this molecular weight distribution .	3.4489780785436626

So , GPC with Tripple detector RI plus viscosity plus LS light scattering , we get molecular weight no standard require you can get absolute molecular weight .	2.5828906852006566

And we also get information about say shapes of the polymer branching etcetera also can be obtained from these detectors .	3.8246317049275254

These are the modern detectors available in the market .	4.078870422018094

Before that let us go through few practical points and for example , for organic solvent the beads are typically used as cross linked polystyrene or surface - treated silica gel and for aqueous medium porous beads of cross linked water soluble polymers are used .	2.6567543725351226

The peak resolution is proportional to 1 over d square .	4.296445217079757

So , basically the bead size grows up the resolution becomes inferior .	3.063034606489423

So , it is always preferable to get a smaller width size ; for example , nowadays it is 5 micrometer or 10 micrometer at largest we use in actually to get a better resolution .	2.6324198720055487

The resolution also depends on the length of the column , but not as much as the size diameter of the beads ; it is depends on length l to the power half .	3.3902296473383915

So , if you increase the length of the column the resolution goes up .	3.9218738607798955

So , preferably we use longer column ; typically in normal sense , we actually use few column in series and some cases to make the process faster ; we mix bed type columns are used where you have the columns are made with different pore size and you can use two such or three such mix bed columns in series or a single different pore size columns also in series .	2.4202064342222442

Obviously , as you have seen this temperature plays a more important .	4.676556668168339

So , it is preferable that the column is kept in a constant temperature ; obviously , the sample loading is small from a very dilute solution ; specially , when you are using detectors like light scattering and viscosity there we are assumption the solution is very dilute .	2.61531986315783

So , that we can consider the specific viscosity divide by c as an intrinsic viscosity and the molecular obtained by light scattering ; there will be less error .	3.833086924087893

High temperature GPC ’ s are required for crystalline polymer ; crystalline polymers are not typically soluble in room temperature .	3.4334993924792907

So , they are dissolved at a high temperature and the column and the escaped at a higher temperature , and the separation is performed at that higher temperature .	3.824924508848184

So , we typically use this term high temperature GPC for that ; and very high molecular weight polymers typically more than 6 ; Dalton they are sometimes 6 gram per mole type polymers might get the inside the column , because generation of high shear .	2.3902835888498135

So , we should be careful in using very high molecular weight in determining very high molecular weight in GPC .	4.231327314981705

And if you have computed system like copolymers blend , we require more than one detector to fully characterize to fully determine molecular weight of those .	3.151600176627186

Let us move to the next topic ; this is the molecular mass spectroscopy of polymers .	4.428377111081251

Now , we know that in mass spectroscopy which basically involve the study of mass of an ions and created by ionization of fragmentation , and then determine the electrically at the gas phase .	2.326505393677992

For example , a molecule is vaporized and then ionized , and then these ions are taken to the detector , and the molecular weight is obtained .	3.391407095676901

Now , while vaporization the molecules may also get , because it is a high temperature to process the molecules can get degraded also .	3.270309760209052

But for small molecules which have all the molecules have same molecular weight fragmentation does not matter , because the highest molecular ion will represents the molecular or will give the molecular weight for the small molecule or the molecules ; but in case of polymer , one polymer sample consist of many chains of different lengths or different molecular weight .	3.176679407995387

So , that it becomes complicated .	7.9857125585946775

So , if you are considering polymer sample this fragmentation of the polymer chain during the vaporization will give you lot of error and that is not acceptable .	3.9959323193455547

So , we must have some mechanism whereby which the polymers can be vaporized without having any degradation or fragmentation of polymer chain .	3.0039270303956163

So , what is the modification done to get the mass spectroscopy polymers ; one soft ionization mechanism is used where will come in a minute using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization or MALDI by which the polymers are vaporized with the help of a matrix without degradation and we also use the second technique called time of flight mass spectroscopy ; and in combination of these two techniques we get MALDI TOF MS matrix assisted laser desorption ionization , time of flight mass spectroscopy which is nowadays very important or very common for polymer samples .	2.3343629709713487

So , we will discuss a little bit of MALDI TOF now .	4.890669051310508

Let us discuss the MALDI matrix assisted laser desorption ionization .	3.393994420399631

In this case a dilute solution of polymer sample is mixed with a concentrated matrix solution and the matrix typically of organic acids .	3.217135758450621

So , basically we make a dilute solution of polymer and they mix with a very concentrated solution of the matrix which are typically organic acids , and a small alicut from this mixture is taken , and applied to the mass spectroscopy plate , and it solidifies as the solvent vaporizes .	2.9087181447163784

So , the small alicut is taken from the mixture and applied to MALDI plate and it solidifies as the solvent evaporates .	2.6403965414111057

The plate is placed in a source of mass spectrometer and a short pulse of high energy if this is a must sample plate , and this is your sample along with the matrix ; and a short pulse of high energy laser is irradiates the target , vaporizing the matrix when a high energy lasers irradiates with the polymer sample along with the matrix gets vaporized and in the vapor phase the polymer actually desorbs from the matrix , and if the polymer is ionized already a charged polymer is fine ; if it is not charged , it is a neutral polymer then we have to add some salt to cationise this polymers .	2.8903520395738003

So , that they can move towards the detector .	5.0727497988885455

So , the neutral polymers are ionized or cationized by protons or metal cations like sodium , Na plus , K plus or say silver plus .	2.2134747566095876

So , this the name as the name suggest we take assistance of a matrix to vaporize by help of a laser radiation and in the vaporized states the polymers gets dissolved from the matrix and then get ionized .	2.602876690687094

So , this name MALDI comes from there .	4.4132936697364205

So , in MALDI , choosing of matrix is very critical and it needs to optimize for every polymer samples .	2.50762748704311

It must form uniform solutions with the polymers and the added salt ; it must strongly absorb the laser wavelength .	2.869476852322985

So , that the vaporization be taken place and it should give rapid vaporization .	3.2261121077418884

The salt you know we said that neutral polymers need that distance from the salt to become cationize and for example , this polyesters , polyamides , polyether ’ s whereas , hetero atom ; salts like sodium , potassium , lithium ’ s are used , because these cations are alkyl metal cations can attach with this hetero atom and cationize this polymer .	2.0971444049015084

The polymers having unsaturations , the silver cation can be used ; it can actually complex with the pi bond ; for example , polystyrene , polybutadiene this polymer cation can be used .	2.872362931983902

For oliphinic polymers like polyethylene , polypropylene , it is very difficult to find a cation which might complex with these oliphinic polymers ; it is very difficult to cationize and then analyze this polymers by MALDI ; and water soluble polymers already which does not soluble in a solvent is also very difficult .	2.8982640077598703

The solvents must be chosen in such that if you evaporate quickly to give a uniform mixture of the polymer matrix and the salt should quickly evaporate and give the salt .	3.161394613277442

Let us talk about the mass analyzation time of flight mass analyzer which is basically the source for the mass spectrum source where the matrix is vaporized and polymers are ionized , and then they are taken to the detector , and in this case the time of flight mass analyzer ; the every cation they actually travel same path all the molecular ions travel same path to a detector and the detector measure the time which the ions take to reach the detector ; the heavier ions would take more time to reach the detector where lighter ions ; obviously , will take a lower time move faster to the detector .	2.358282211054412

So , this is example of one MALDI from PMMA polymethylmethaacrolate and you can see these are the peaks from different polymer chains .	3.514055023874757

So , here you can exactly get the difference in the signals with a molecular weight of the repeating unit .	3.8846398410595477

And from this distribution the different molecular weight like number average molecular weight , weight average molecular weight and other molecules can be directly obtained .	3.922771760237624

So , this is absolute technique .	5.91334034886749

So , no calibration is required .	6.5401140414981755

Now , quickly go through advantage of MALDI TOF , it is small amount of sample is required ; very sub milligram sample is required and the analysis happens fast within very few minutes compared to the other techniques ; it is very efficient .	2.9100795741183005

It does not depend whether the polymer structure is a linear structure ; for example , for gel permeation chromatography , we typically use the principles and postulates of the Gaussian flexible polymer chain , but in this case we do not need any polymers having any shapes or any structures can be determined ; and the MALDI TOF very efficiently for low molecular regions very GPC does not work , and other information besides molecular weight averages and the poly disperisty index , the repeat unit mass , the end group mass this are also can be received .	2.372115393889974

So , just all this benefits , but the only disadvantage is that the price of MALDI TOF is very high .	3.312066800936081

So , it is not very convenient to use the MLADI TOF in every lab .	3.538816473676894

So , with this we stop the discussion of determination of molecular weight and we move to the next topic in next lecture .	3.75923153792193

Today we shall consider various reactor configurations for carrying out enzyme catalyzed reactions You will appreciate from the previous discussion that among the various applications of enzymes and particularly the immobilized enzyme , their utilization for carrying out various chemical transformations is perhaps one of the most important sectors of industrial processing .	2.7538372656830385

This field of application is also more important from the point of view that it has an economical implication particularly because that you have some other alternatives available particularly in the form of chemical transformations with which the enzymatic transformation have to compete and therefore the system has to be optimized up to the complete plant design .	2.8807433734069092

While the major feature of the whole process will include the immobilized enzyme preparation itself but over and above you also need some kind of a hardware , an equipment in which the immobilized enzyme or for that matter even soluble enzyme can play around and catalyze the reaction .	3.014253931081552

The proper design , proper choice of configuration of these enzyme reactors is therefore very important keeping in view the whole process of economics and which plays in addition to the catalytic function of the enzyme the whole operation will be controlled economically by even the choice of the reactor .	2.8096481612466526

A number of reactor systems are available .	5.641541466881052

They can be classified in a very general way on the basis of their mode of charging and discharging of the substrate and product stream .	4.034419160219392

In laboratory experimentation , take a simple stirred vessel in which you take a beaker .	4.727058536615742

You put it on a magnetic stirrer or you can also insert a mechanical stirrer if you want and then you can add the enzyme particles into it and the substrate can be fed to it .	3.6422829748471384

You can control the pH and temperature of the reaction and you can carry out the reaction in the laboratory .	5.9224146755330445

Here the mode of charging and discharging of substrate is once .	3.6400884334815347

You initially feed the enzyme as well as the substrate and at the end of the reaction take out the final product and enzyme is mixed with it if it is soluble enzyme ; if it is an immobilized enzyme preparation , you can filter it or centrifuge it to recover back .	3.8504934681531067

So that is one of the probably simplest configurations that are possible to carry out an enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.4593385156309964

The two factors on which the classification of enzyme reactors can be based are on the mode of charging and discharging of substrate and product stream and also physical configuration .	2.7926924304096605

What is the shape of the reactor ?	7.051320166367357

For example it is a column ; it is a stirred vessel or it could be an ultra filtration cell or what ever kind of configuration is available that also can be used and keeping in view a very broad classification can be given on the basis of batch reactors and continuous reactors and the kind of reactor system that I described a little earlier for experimental purposes fall under batch category .	3.0280735689955827

That means the batch reactors are very suitable for small scale experimental studies mainly because that they are simple in construction and operation and they don ’ t need any supporting structure unlike in the case of continuous reactors where you need to feed the substrate stream continuously so you need a pump .	2.667210238391238

Similarly at the outlet you also need a pump to withdraw the product stream whereas in the case of batch reactors you just initially charge the reactors and continue under reaction conditions ; then discharge the reactor and at the end of it do cleaning operation .	2.7332448129687963

So no supporting structures are required and therefore they are very simple and they find a very common application in the small scale experimental studies .	3.2854422106287755

In the case of soluble enzymes , the enzyme cannot be separated .	3.7980402205269956

So therefore most of the enzyme reactions that require crude enzyme preparations where no degree of purifications is needed particularly in cases for food or beverage productions , the soluble enzymes are added and they carry out reactions and they go along with the product stream and the enzyme is not required to be separated .	3.122141667561069

However if we use immobilized enzyme preparation , the separation of the enzyme is feasible by filtration or centrifugation and you can reuse it .	4.43446054082428

In fact even batch reactors are used in commercial preparations extensively mainly because of their simplicity and ease of fabrication and operational convenience for many reactions .	2.8170091285337886

One typical example is the hydrolysis of penicillin to 6 - amino penicillinic acid , 6 - APA , which is an intermediate for ampicillin .	3.3615709164436245

This is usually done in a repeated batch reactor using immobilized enzyme and the immobilized enzyme is retained in the reactor either by providing a mask for filtering the enzyme to be retained in the reactor or it can be strained after the product stream has been recovered .	3.218516536316978

Batch reactors also have an important feature for use with the soluble enzymes where most of the continuous enzyme systems are not very suitable .	3.6169903124675717

There are options where even soluble enzymes can be used in a continuous reactor but for practically most applications the use of soluble enzyme is usually with the batch reactors .	3.2684111026824034

The third feature in favor of the batch reactor is the use of insoluble substrates .	3.7490011271958665

While in the case of continuous reactors the use of insoluble substrate particularly using immobilized enzyme preparations is not feasible particularly in terms of reactions being carried out by solid contact which is difficult , for most of the enzyme catalyzed reactions which involve insoluble substrates the batch reaction systems are very ideally suited .	3.0998752890063783

To illustrate with example the insoluble substrates are like hydrolysis of cellulose .	3.6071013412821946

Cellulosic materials are insoluble and the enzyme has to be reacted with this insoluble substrate to hydrolyze into glucose .	4.110996408991961

Very often for small scale operations you can have this stirred tank with jacket for temperature control .	3.2125365335980876

On the large scale you can also have coils inserted into the reactor whereby temperature control can be monitored and another advantage is even you can have devices for addition of acids or alkali if pH control is the requirement of the reaction .	2.768628777078013

In the example I cited a little ago on the hydrolysis of penicillin to 6 - APA because of simultaneous acid production you need to control the pH otherwise the enzyme gets inactivated and a very precise control of pH is needed and therefore addition of the alkali simultaneously is a must and which can be carried out very easily in a stirred batch reactor and with a control system you can control the pH .	2.6563234842436896

The extent of reaction can also be monitored by the quantity of alkali consumed because stoichiometrically the quantity of acid produced is same as the extent of conversion of penicillin to 6 - APA .	3.510174326064977

The other modified form is a packed bed reactor particularly when we are talking of immobilized enzymes and the enzyme now in the form of either spherical particles , globules , chips , membranes then can be packed into a column and make a packed bed and the reactor can be operated in a batch mode in the total recycle .	3.3023980265365727

In the second case of recycle reactor , if the product outlet is closed and the total enzyme is then recycled back into the feed , the whole operation can be carried out over a period of time which is a batch reaction time .	2.927493066010041

The only constrain or the assumption here to be considered from the quantitative point of view as the batch reactor or as a perfect mixed batch reactor will be that the cycle time of the substrate must be very , very small compared to the total batch time .	3.3549143112710054

For a perfect total recycled reactor to be considered as a batch reactor operation the requirement should be that the total recycled time must be very small or negligible compared to the total batch cycle ; that is the recycling has to be very fast .	3.283145522711401

In the case of batch reaction at any given time all the enzyme must be in contact with the total substrate feed .	3.772989603013686

So to achieve that the recycle time must be very small or the recycling has to be very fast and therefore these two kinds of reactor systems are very commonly used as batch reactor .	3.2349302713955574

The second category and probably which is of most significance to us as in the case of immobilized enzyme systems are continuous flow reactors because the major purpose of the immobilizing enzymes is to use them in continuous modes or repeated mode .	2.523876400219975

You can use the batch reactors also in case of repeated mode .	5.437373497494474

But more conveniently they can be used in the form of the immobilized enzymes in continuous reactors .	5.458619631494946

Three major classes of continuous reactors are listed here .	4.451627806255079

You have continuous stirred tank reactor and the classical feature of a continuous stirred tank reactor is it is a type of a stirred reactor in which you give a continuous supply of substrates in the form of feed and the same volume at the same rate the product stream is taken out while retaining the immobilized enzyme preparation in the reactor stream .	3.60701560462616

The major characteristic feature of the continuous stirred tank reactor often denoted as CSTR is that the contents of the reactor are perfectly mixed or the system is totally homogeneous .	3.2663081182393543

That means the concentration of any particular species in the reaction system is uniform through out the content of the reactor and this concentration is same as that in the outlet stream .	4.311640739739632

These characteristics makes a very unique situation and whenever contents in the reactor are at the same composition as in the product stream it implies that the concentration of the substrates in the reactor is at a level which is present in the outlet stream .	4.040015768813509

For example if you want to carry out a conversion of let us say a 95 % leaving back 5 % of the substrate that means the concentration of the substrate in the reactor will be only 5 % of that of the feed inlet .	4.524446825291986

So the effective concentration of the substrate at which the reaction is taking place is much smaller than the substrate inlet stream concentration and therefore such reactions will be ideally suited for the enzyme catalyzed reactions which are strongly substrate inhibited because the effective substrate concentration in the reactor will be much lesser than the actual substrate concentration in the feed stream .	3.7040258819691765

So the inhibitory effect will be totally masked .	4.575257328405485

On the other hand if the reaction is inhibited by the product then such reactors are not very suitable because the content in the reactor will also have a very high product concentration at any given time .	3.6298505589101318

So therefore the reaction will always continue in a product inhibited design .	4.322794195336582

So the reaction rate can be very slow .	7.175111691033405

So therefore the reactors in the form of continuous stirred tank reactors are ideally suited for substrate inhibited reactions rather than product inhibited reactions .	3.0179136583181942

So that is one feature .	6.548770840622391

The second category is plug flow reactors .	4.801374201683548

Plug flow reactors or in a much boarder sense you can say packed bed reactors are probably one of the most commonly used types of reactors in the immobilized enzyme applications mainly because of the nature of the catalyst .	4.065455001805154

Because it is used in the form of either particles or films it can be easily packed in the system and can provide a very high catalyst density , enzyme density in the reactor system .	3.8406444548807452

Higher the catalyst density the over all reaction rate can also be very high because the enzyme concentration per unit volume will be much higher compared to a CSTR .	4.328317214560084

But the basic characteristics of plug flow reactor is that the substrate inlet stream moves do they flat concentration profile or velocity profile along the length of a reactor ?	3.2712900741214885

Consider an enzyme reactor .	9.843845035304783

This is an enzyme reactor , a plug flow reactor and then consider the central axis , the velocity profile of the feed .	3.3908988876109

This is s ; this is the product stream .	9.29404482377677

The concentration profile of the feed at any given cross section of the reactor is flat .	4.4613220468427945

That means there are no actual dispersions and so the velocity profile of the feed stream throughout the length of the reactor is flat or in other words the feed inlet , the feed stream moves almost like a plug and therefore the name what we talk about as a plug flow reactor .	3.1359565683093034

But in the case of large reactors there are lot of deviations from the plug flow behavior which we will consider .	3.6949876102415

They can be accounted in while we consider the reactor performance .	3.991785518835991

The third category of the continuous reactors are fluidized bed reactors .	3.6593542732505866

They are somewhere between the continuous stirred tank reactors and the plug flow reactors and if you put the substrate feed at a speed high enough to lift the bed or fluidize the bed but not allow the catalyst particle to go out of the reactor , unlike in the case of a packed bed there is a static bed of the immobilized enzyme particles and the linear velocity of the feed is not large enough so that the bed can be disturbed .	3.110549382123949

This will be a function of the particle shape and size .	6.737996003785345

Particle shape and size will control the voidage in the packed bed but when you move ahead from the plug flow behavior and continue to increase feed velocity stream to a level that the bed is packed , bed is disturbed .	2.5443872103963883

It gets fluidized ; the particles are fluidized in the reactor system almost like as shown here in the reactor but not to the extent that the catalyst particles are driven out of the reactor system .	3.5523373892532155

We call it fluidized bed ; fluidized bed immobilization reactor .	3.4229795275190473

Such reactors in terms of fluid dynamics probably provide a performance somewhere in between the CSTR and PFR but are ideally suited for the reactions which have a requirement of good heat and mass transfer because in many of the situations like in packed bed the heat and mass transfer may be very difficult and particularly in case of reactions which are exothermic in nature there might be lot of local heat hot spots which can inactivate the enzyme .	2.7818962527800557

Fortunately in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions , the reactions are not highly exothermic .	5.493425238983958

They are usually isothermal and therefore the problem of heat transfer is not so severe .	3.9249300389616963

But even a smaller level of heat generated can be taken care very easily in case of fluidized bed reactors .	3.801016773662782

Alternatively if your substrate is highly viscous or let us say colloidal in nature , in those cases also a fluidized bed reactor can provide you a much better system for carrying out immobilized enzyme reactions in a continuous mode .	3.1046611598448517

In fact fluidized bed reactor itself is a hybrid between the two major classes .	4.323387153739855

But even under CSTR a modification which has been proposed is in the form of CSTR coupled with the ultra filtration cell .	3.6675029105199233

Particularly in case where you want to carry out reactions using insoluble substrates or soluble enzymes and want to use a continuous reactor .	3.679893658073856

For a soluble enzyme you cannot use a plug flow reactor .	4.696315759365454

So CSTR coupled with an ultra filtration reactor can be easily used for carrying out a reaction with the soluble enzyme or with insoluble substrates .	3.936781002594535

In the case of soluble enzyme the use of plug flow reactor will drive away the enzyme simultaneously and you cannot use it continuously .	3.2540183648031236

In the case of a CSTR , you can use a soluble enzyme or along with a soluble or insoluble substrate by carrying out in a CSTR and coupling the CSTR with the ultra filtration module .	3.3119790643998583

That is the reactor output instead of going directly to the product stream passes through ultra filtration unit in which the product stream is filtered out and can be taken out of the product stream while the retentate which contains mainly the enzyme is recycled back into the reactor .	3.4029364950174243

In this case here we do the same thing ; a part of the output stream which is the filtrate from the ultra filtration unit is taken out to the product stream and the retentate of the ultra filtration unit is cycled back into the reactor and it can be operated in a continuous shift .	3.746909983102247

So overall performance wise in terms of the reactor performance it can be considered almost similar to that of a CSTR .	5.738040623510301

There are two major modifications which has been proposed in the case of plug flow reactors .	4.438680723503386

While the conventional systems as we have seen use the packed bed and feed the substrate in either at the top of the column or at the bottom of the column either of the combination is feasible but they may also have some operational problems .	3.2519487461789383

Of the two major modifications of that which have been proposed and have been used in the enzyme catalyzed reaction , one is a hollow fiber reactor .	3.9839706569545874

In the case of hollow fiber the system is something like in a shell and tube reactor ; shell and tube heat exchanger type of situation where you have very fine capillary type of fibers which are semi permeable in which the enzyme can be entrapped .	2.682726910170509

The enzyme feed is put in , in the hollow fibers and the main feed substrate is passed through the cell side and because of the semi permeability of the hollow fiber membranes the substrate and the enzyme can come in contact .	3.255012605513696

That means the substrate can go into the vicinity of the enzyme and product can go out and ultimately the product stream can be taken out but the enzyme cannot go out of the ultra filtration tubes and such a reaction system has an advantage that you can use such a system as a continuous plug flow reactors even using the soluble enzymes .	3.719414878114574

While a packed bed system cannot be used in the soluble enzyme but a hollow fiber reactor can be used in soluble enzyme and particularly where contacting an enzyme and the substrate is a problem such reactors have been used and in terms of flow behavior , because of these hollow fibers being of the capillary size , very fine capillaries and a bundle is made so they almost provide a reactor performance in line with the plug flow barrier No .	2.9064083893333788

In the hollow fiber tubes , capillary tubes is the enzymes contained and in space provided between the tubes and the cell the substrate feed is fed into it .	2.375683597777456

You are referring to this one .	5.317589711191562

This is only a cross section of the system .	4.104513227434397

In fact all the tubes at the top are joined in a section so that they come out in the same section .	3.3222224517536243

This is only a cross section shown here in the expanded form .	3.6711308942183223

The circles which you are seeing here they are blown up here in this form and they indicate one hollow fiber .	3.121051197756564

The whole reactor consists of a bundle of hollow fibers almost about eighty or hundred hollow fibers can be constituted in about one square inch of that order hollow fiber .	1.9697827365956022

But there are systems reported in which they are on the tube walls .	3.5991087713802137

The enzyme can be immobilized but alternatively in the general fashion it can also be in the form of soluble enzyme .	4.217412381468429

When you say when you are immobilizing on the walls of the tube then they don ’ t operate really on the hollow fiber reactor .	2.7766819800212037

Then it is almost like a packed bed reactor in which the tube side is used as the matrix and it is almost like a packed bed reactor .	4.381481263120464

It doesn ’ t matter whether you pack it in a horizontal fashion or a vertical fashion the tubes are used as the immobilized matrix whereas I am talking about that the enzyme which is used in the soluble mode .	3.336601563747346

It is retained in the semi permeable hollow fiber tubes so that it is not able to go out almost similar to microencapsulation where the enzyme is contained in the forms of tubes .	3.277004938608579

The other noble modification of the plug flow system is a spiral membrane bound module .	3.5771274591787563

It is a very specific configuration which has been reported and has been used industrially and this system has been used extensively for immobilized enzyme preparations which are in the form of thin films .	3.8295911230979813

The typical application which reversed is where the enzyme is immobilized on the collagen matrix in the form of thin films and you get a very long roll .	3.6557417106261707

It can even also be used along with , like your fiber entrapped enzymes , if the fibers are woven in the form of a cloth or thing like that so that you get a very large surface area in the form of a film , long film .	2.893864515136071

What is done is that this thin film of the enzyme containing enzyme is bound spirally on to central core .	3.578516351352203

You take a central core on which spirally the enzyme sheet is wrapped around the core and in between to provide strength there is a matrix or there is a kind of a porous sheet which can keep the two enzyme sheets separated .	2.8747044214497164

It serves two purposes ; one is that it provides strength to the enzyme sheet .	4.547010650702459

The other is it also doesn ’ t allow the enzymes system to get clogged and that can be packed into a column into a tube and such a system also can provide a very high enzyme loading because the surface area available on the thin film is very , very large and therefore it can provide a very high enzyme loading and also the system performs almost like a plug flow reactor .	2.7296806927450326

Only thing is instead of packing the column with the particulate material what you are doing is the film is being wrapped along a core spaced by another sheet and then the whole core is inserted into a column .	2.588583452330614

So you can feed the substrate either from the top or the bottom and take out another stream .	2.907231125282088

It is almost like a plug flow reactor .	4.858437823593159

I must say that this is not the comprehensive list of the type of the reactors that has been reported .	4.518527306091917

Very large variations of reactor designs have been reported .	4.170922969384307

Even for example in the case of a CSTR people have immobilized the enzyme on to the base of the …… and carryout the reaction .	3.5320222519711133

So a variety of configurations had been used but some of them are purely of catalytic interest also .	3.514708645886958

But by and large from the fluid dynamics and reactor performance point of view they have to be classified on one of those standard operational modes .	3.0538967205694267

To sum up the type of reactors that are available the combined continuous stirred flow reactors with the ultra filtration system is useful with the soluble enzyme or along with the immobilized enzyme particularly by an insoluble substrates are required to be handled or colloidal substrates are required to be handled .	3.0087920897495772

Because in the handling of colloidal substrates , you often find difficulty with the flux flow reactors .	2.441798016173188

So the combined CSTR coupled with the ultra filtration reactor can be easily used .	3.966021793717332

Such reactors had been very poor in terms of long term operations mainly because of the adsorption of the enzyme on to the membrane surface .	4.089135103497856

So most of the membranes provide a good adsorption surface and the enzymes get adsorbed on to that and the reactor performance is … .	3.7981838811316675

All the defects or all the limitations of an ultra filtration system will also be associated here .	3.506182024507477

The reaction system will have to face all the problems like concentration polarization of an ultra filtration system and unless those are taken care the reaction performance will be adversely affected .	2.5850592125042784

One is that the system undergoes a very fast rate of deactivation mainly because you have to transfer the whole material along with the substrate into the ultrafiltration module and recycle back the retentate and so during that transfer there is a significant loss occurring .	3.214687943317269

In most of these one of the reasons of activation is also … .	5.2590150772266435

inactivation and in case of even CSTR many of the enzymes or the carrier particles that are … .	5.60264376942593

sensitive or carriers which can go undergo lot of attrition during use the CSTR becomes a sort of a disadvantageous system because if the carrier particles get disintegrated during use it will involve the loss of enzyme .	2.5415781207456263

In the case of CSTR , the most favorable point is that for reactions which are substrate inhibited , CSTR is a desirable feature .	3.0684562294519573

In the case of a plug flow reactor you have a recycle system so that have an external loop in which the pH monitoring and control is exercised or otherwise in the ideal plug flow behavior the pH control is difficult .	2.9223166889503487

But the CSTR provides an ideal tool and in many cases of immobilized enzyme reactions pH control is a requisite .	3.4842977699609414

Then in the case of CSTR even colloidal or insoluble substrates can be processed which is not feasible in the case of plug flow behavior and then easy replacement of catalyst .	3.561555052880676

We have talked about higher yields for reaction undergoing substrate inhibition .	3.319313573444573

Then in the case of plug flow reactors often it has been noted that the conversion efficiencies are much higher compared to CSTR and the major reason for that are two .	3.294247460666946

We will see the quantitative analysis of the reactor performance in both the cases .	5.2513390019201704

But one of the major reason is that most of the enzyme reactions are inhibited if not very excessively but mildly by product concentration .	3.622085004092603

So the plug flow maximizes or minimizes the product concentration at any given point .	3.786916954349814

The maximum product concentration is only at the outlet stream but across the reactor length the product concentration is much lesser than the outlet stream as the opposite happens in the case of a CSTR .	3.4455976373586332

So the reactor performance is much better usually in the case of PFR .	5.532578079468585

The second reason is that the enzyme loading per unit volume is much higher in the PFR compared to the CSTR .	5.468502998093309

In the CSTR , the concentration of the enzyme which you can …. .. usually is not very high when compared to the PFR .	5.677586224344791

The other category of enzyme reactor , fluidized bed reactor , as I mentioned earlier are much better suited for heat and mass transfer characteristics and freedom from plugging .	2.8143535541753146

Very often if colloidal substrates are to be used a plug flow reactors faces problem in terms of plugging or choking of the column .	3.737750475218967

Insoluble substrates can be used .	9.865296616222658

One of the disadvantage is the power requirement for fluidizing the beds because you need to feed the substrate at the very high linear velocities which requires a much higher power consumption and the scale up of the fluidized bed reactors has also been very largely empirical .	2.558916453619825

The scale up systems is more empirical compared to CSTR and PFR which are considered to be idealized reactor systems because in terms of fluid flow behavior they represent the two extremes .	2.8104814358456314

In one there is no actual dispersion ; in the other case there is complete back mixing .	4.584261420631671

So therefore their modeling or their arriving of electrode performance is much certain , much more defined and therefore the scale up can be easily carried out whereas in the case of fluidized bed reactor a scale up is more empirical .	2.757695969152844

There will not be much pressure drop because just like in the case of a packed bed reactor the particles are all compact .	3.6407990649052007

So when you feed a substrate the pressure drop will be very large if the particle size is very fine .	3.760147497901858

In the case of a fluidized bed reactor the voidage is very high .	3.6737680606157945

The voidage is almost approximating to that of CSTR ; not the same but it is approaching to that and therefore there is no pressure drop and the system has a very large voidage ; the voidage increases .	3.5126066114058214

Before we go into the reactor performance of different types of reactor for the immobilized enzyme systems , we cannot normally consider all the parameters like non - ideal fluid dynamics , the mass transfer constraints and along with the biochemical reaction we cannot really combine at one stage .	3.2670097432876735

We can take up those issues one by one and to begin with we can only consider an idealized enzyme reactor system .	2.939796034920501

We would like to make certain assumptions before we go into the reactor performance and the assumptions are that first thing we are assuming that the reactor undergoes an isothermal operation .	3.328006110383481

That means ?	22.89119573583991

H value of the reaction is not very high so that there is no temperature gradient in the reaction ; the first assumption .	7.1517971264578994

Second is uniform enzyme distribution .	7.087894455470074

In practice there are reports that even in an immobilized enzyme preparation itself there are no uniform enzyme distribution practically .	3.5283855176826027

But for theoretical purposes , we assume that the enzyme is distributed uniformly in the reactor whether it is a plug flow reactor or is a batch reactor or a CSTR .	4.316702878693634

The third condition is we are assuming either a plug flow behavior for packed bed or a completely back mix behavior for CSTR in terms of fluid dynamics .	3.2941222461128534

We are not considering anywhere that means even fluidized bed is not considered as an idealized reactor system .	2.741754984637045

So we are considering the two extreme conditions either a plug flow behavior or a completely back mix system .	3.618759119876098

Then we are also ignoring external film or internal pore diffusion limitations if any .	3.281261612425789

We are considering that there are no diffusional limitations .	6.034750140599439

That means the rate of reaction is much slower than the rate of diffusion .	5.3474175188891735

The rate of diffusion is fast enough .	6.2199365087014264

Then the last assumption is that there is no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase .	3.39844046155615

If the system follows such we can evaluate or conduct a reactor performance on the basis of biochemical reaction , their reaction kinetics and to do so the major reactor design parameters which have to be considered are listed here .	2.7293098798511073

The first one is “tau ” which is the reactor space time in terms of V / Q .	5.585718328605601

Here V is the reactor volume and Q is the flow rate in the case of a continuous reactor .	4.723039647320653

“tau ” in the case of the batch reactor is the batch reaction time .	4.730163426321615

Then you have initial substrate concentration ; another parameter which we have to define in any problem of a immobilized enzyme or soluble enzyme reactor we first define the S0 , the batch time or the reactor space time in continuous reactors .	2.9427421600089567

Then the total enzyme concentration in the system .	7.014045573990832

When I say E0 , I think it will be desirable to also have the magnitude of kd , the deactivation constant .	3.802627002947035

Particularly it will be more important when we are talking of continuous operation where the reactor operation time is large enough the deactivation constant will also play a key role .	3.603063847372748

Then the temperature of operation because deactivation also will depend on the operational temperature .	4.115233355390778

I would like to mention here that most continuous enzyme reactors are usually operated little below their optimum temperatures just to increase or reduce the kd values and increase the operational half life .	2.3942158598073466

Then pH ; pH here is not only monitoring but more important is the control of pH .	3.371026184862711

How are you exercising control of pH ?	4.712624606528799

Then fraction of conversion in the reactor which can be defined as ( S0 - S ) / S0 .	7.400205232441401

That means the concentration difference ; substrate concentration between the inlet and the outlet stream , the ratio of the two .	3.436245958183833

Then the reactor productivity is another parameter which is important .	5.065427399086057

X.S0 / tau .	24.223511781564266

If we consider S0 as the concentration term so that it becomes per unit volume also .	4.535778114720235

Then the reactor capacity ; although under given set of conditions you may get certain kind of productivity for a reactor capacity will be given by the Vm .	2.7349110532751286

k2.E0.V.e * .	8.765536755133343

Here even in case of tau also we can multiply by voidage if you want to consider a broader picture of a packed bed reactor because this V , reactor volume is not the packed bed volume it is the volume of the fluid in the reactor .	3.4801307155448558

So the total bed multiplied by the voidage will give a fluid volume in the reactor .	3.6401706685539876

In the case of CSTR voidage can be considered almost equal to one whether the volume occupied by the carrier is very , very small compared to the total reactor volume .	3.496449731220995

Then reaction capacity can be given by k2.E0 which is Vm multiplied by the reactor volume and the voidage and then finally the important parameter is enzyme kinetics itself because the reactor performance will depend upon the reaction kinetics which controls the reaction .	3.402183635875455

Mind that we are not considering under idealized reactor conditions .	5.426625273979436

Anything like diffusional limitations , partitioning effects and non - ideal fluid flow behaviour which we will consider subsequently one by one to arrive at the final reactor performance .	3.2563980548936295

Pr is reactor productivity and Cr is the reactor capacity .	4.30119636168306

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture number 22 , we are going to continue our first half our discussion on chain copolymerization .	2.6218921961075567

We will cover the remaining parts of the chain copolymerization discussion we are having .	3.8225933313213623

And then take from there I will start a new topic or new synthetic procedure namely ring opening polymerization .	2.6991605333731696

Now , if you look at the slides we had during last 2 lectures the in our discussion on chain copolymerization , we basically covered these topics different types of copolymers , importance of copolymerization , and copolymer composition .	2.642612436371179

Then microstructures , alternate random blocky structure , how the reactivity difference between the monomers actually give this type of copolymer microstructure .	3.3651884449351206

And we have talked about copolymerization composition drift with time and then we talked about how the monomer reactivity ’ s and different types of chain initiation , you know types of chain initiation , actually determine these values of the reactivity ratios .	3.689022340439214

In today ' s lecture we will just cover this treat of care we will talk about Q e scheme and then briefly about ionic copolymerization how that is different from radical copolymerization .	2.743228144407324

And just a brief idea about the type of application this copolymers goes .	4.606621829650334

Now , in the last lecture we talked about different factors contributing to the reactivities of this the monomers and in turn the reactivity ratio the value of the reactivity ratio of these monomers .	4.222053174772624

We talked about the resonance stabilization of the substituted group , we talked about the electron charge density , electronic charge density , we talked about the steric effect and so on .	3.2600852289061932

Now , all these factors actually contribute to the reactivity of the monomer in such a way that it is very difficult to distinguish , the contribution from each of these factors in the reactivity of the monomers .	4.013975690604789

Hence it is very difficult to get a quantitative idea or is very difficult to predict the reactivity ratios of the monomers from a given structure .	4.2821043468741244

Nonetheless one semi empirical method proposed by Price and Alphre is often used very commonly to sort of get the reactivity ratios of different monomers , and a ranking between different monomers in terms of their reactivities .	2.744796559358732

And that is a semi empirical approach and this is the Q e ' s Q e scheme we are talking about .	4.113209263217467

And this is we talking a continue our discussion on radical copolymerization so it is applicable for radical copolymerization .	3.7787439238301395

And this scheme is based on the assumption that the rate constant , rate constant of reaction between a propagating radical P this is a propagating radical P with a monomer , monomer m .	4.308890205494478

Now this rate constant can write k P m this is rate constant for reaction between a propagating polymer radical P and a monomer m is given by these expression , where this 2 terms are the reactivity measure of the reactivity of the polymer like radical .	3.451615486848599

And this is the measure of reactivity of the monomer and this two term e p and e m they are the measure of the electronic charges , electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer respectively .	3.5562760221842526

So , if I write from this the expression for r 1 which is given by k 1e 1 by k 1 2 I should write .	3.955344817533882

Now , this both cases the polymer radical is the same so this will get cancelled .	4.700182323378462

So , this cancel out so we get these were this is a the measure of reactivity of monomer 1 and this is the measure of reactivity of monomer 2 .	4.163144145931346

This is the charges electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer .	3.4101628977168277

Now , another assumption is made in this approach is that e p 1 is same as e m 1 and we can and we write this as e 1 .	3.613358608637561

Assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical , which has at the end in monomer 1 structure and the electrostatic charge on monomer is same .	3.867569901438913

And which will I think as e 1 so similarly , we can write e p 2 e m 2 as e 2 .	3.151435002883519

So , again the assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical and the monomer are same , if the monomer residual end of the polymer radical is same as the monomer we are talking about .	4.016558153919705

So , if I can write , similarly for r 2 Q now because Q is always talking about related to monomer .	2.781000241213436

So , we can ignore or remove this term monomer m we can just write Q 1 and Q 2 .	3.1601617198317613

So , now we can write Q 1 and Q 2 and we have seen r 1 Q 1 by Q 2 exponential minus e 1 minus e 2 essentially these 2 relates the reactivity ratios of the monomers to the electrostatic charge on the monomer .	3.1514009032208223

We do not have any charm which is related to the polymer radicals , these are all the terms are related to the monomer .	4.32452925236891

So , basically this relates to the reactivity ’ s of the two monomers and the electrostatic charge on the two monomers .	4.774293470370536

Now , if we multiply these two we get this value for r 1 , r 2 which is basically the measure of we have seen earlier is a measure of alternating tendency .	3.7247690945523138

If it is close to 0 then they the will monomer will produce the alternating microstructure , if they are close to 1 then the 2 monomers will produce a random copolymer .	3.121826163564321

And if they are equals both are equals to 1 then obviously r 1 r 2 will be equal to 1 then that will be exactly random copolymers .	3.4055911958354597

So , r 1 , r 2 will be given by if we can multiply these two given by exponential minus e 1 minus e 2 square .	3.5632722573589413

Now , this expression is in sink with our understanding till now .	3.4953097476013233

Now , if e 1 is a very close to e 2 , that means the electronic charges of the double bond in the monomers are very close , then obviously this will become close to 1 and we get a random copolymers , random copolymers .	4.127909842745676

Now , if the double bond for the two monomer has different electrostatic charge , if they are then they are what will happen r 1 and r 2 would be close to 0 .	3.565428889765112

That means they are reactivity they will produce a more copolymer , which is more closer in alternate , alternate copolymer than a random copolymer .	2.8965632047343157

If e 1 minus e 2 goes up then it will be in an extreme because e 1 and e 2 will get a r 1 , r 2 close to 1 which will give ideal copolymerization as we expect .	3.44322918586793

And if they are think if this goes down so they are there equal and then we get these if they are different then r 1 r 2 will be closer to 0 , producing a alternate copolymer which is in sink with our understanding , whatever we have discussed till now .	3.310691771006414

Now , how do you get this values for Q and e now arbitrarily it has been assigned styrene .	3.461132411398481

And you and rest of the monomers are compared with the value of styrene , what you individual monomers or copolymerized with styrene and from the experimental values of r 1 and r 2 , you can use these expressions where if you consider 1 as styrene .	3.5011166953208446

And then you know Q 1 you know u 1 , hence you will from these to expression and you also know r 1 from experiment r 1 r 2 from experiment .	2.66611810910515

So , from using these to expression you will be able to find out the values for Q 2 and e 2 .	4.493223462211131

So , monomers are copolymerize with styrene and you get the experimental values of r 1 r 2 and from known values of styrene having Q is 1 and e is minus 0.8 , you can get the unknown values for the second monomer .	3.322978028047533

And once you get the individual values for different monomers , they are those values of Q and e are further defined by copolymerizing monomers other than styrene .	2.925629055945425

Basically first copolymers as we styrene , get the experimental values of r 1 and r 2 get from the expression you get Q and e for the unknown monomers .	3.032148680928088

Now , obvious this is Q is measure of reactivity as we have seen and e is measure of electrostatic charge .	3.283764426853935

So , if Q goes up the reactivity will go up and e goes down the value of e goes down because it is a measure of electron density , electrostatic charge .	4.014572793979059

So , basically electron density on the double bond if there ' s a electron donating group then the electronic density or the electrostatic charge will go up , then Q value will be going up .	2.9525192605911132

And if this electron withdrawing group which basically reduces the electron density on the double bond .	3.32477550502941

And hence the electrostatic charge it will be more of a lower number .	5.644077796747828

So , electron density t goes down and electron density goes up and the value is negative e is negative , when the double bond in say this monomer the double bond it is electronic rich compared to a ethylene molecule it is a simple double bond .	3.1973140983594797

So , if you so if you look at few data ' s of the numbers for Q and e the styrene is arbitrarily taken as 1 and minus 8 minus 0.8 .	3.209626942172715

And if you compare with other monomers so like other conjugate diene like isoprene and butadiene because there they can easily stabilize the radical by resonance , their reactivity is high so Q is high .	2.472665324058321

And they also basically act as electron donating group so increase the electron density in the double bond .	3.1648311743231816

So , basically this value is negative and is negative means is equal to electron rich , negative is a charge for electron .	3.1925992081440575

So , negative means electronic rich .	6.208378665505718

Now , if you compare the monomers having electron withdrawing groups like M M A and acrylonitrle , the reactivity comes down compared to styrene because they cannot stabilize as much as styrene can do a propagating radical .	2.8167535630425036

Whereas , because they have electron with drawing group , the charge on the double bond actually lower , it is a more positive charge .	3.941609137723079

So , you get a positive value and acrylonitrle is more strong electron withdrawing group .	3.5074033091262455

So , it has a positive value compared to M M A .	5.211182939527467

The reactivity is very low because they cannot stabilize the radical the propagating radical so their reactivities are low so Q values are low .	3.1547360671967217

And they are dead basically they are weekly donating all the withdrawing groups so values are very low either positive or negative depending up on what is the electron with drawing effect or electron donating effect .	2.5273838947943785

Look at this monomer maleic anhydride we know the structure of maleic anhydride .	4.875180548038849

Now , this is this is a very two very strong electron withdrawing group , so basically the electrostatic charge will be much more positive compared to a ethylene group .	3.9957553271623665

And that is why the value for e is quite high positive 2.25 and these values will vary it is not that these values are very fixed values , but these value might vary little bit depending up on the condition of the reaction among .	3.280306756142364

So , but the trend will be mentioned so absolute values of this monomer Q and e value might change , but the trend will always remain same depending irrespective of the condition .	2.8342383917539826

And the because it cannot stabilize the radical much so we are reactivities also comes down .	3.089972851613051

So , in general we can write that if monomer can stabilize the resonance , the propagating radical the resonance the reactivity is high .	3.2463892940168706

Then Q would be greater than 5 , if they cannot stabilize by resonance them Q would be lower so basically Q is a measure of resonance stabilization .	2.941852720203538

Now , we can so if you know these values , when we know that if the two monomers which are having very electrostatic charge , having very positive charges like acrylonitrle and maleic anhydride .	3.845600152278857

They will be difficult to copolymerize on the other hand if you take maleic anhydride the monomers are very much electrostatically positive .	3.7065813740866806

So , homo polymerization of maleic anhydride is very difficult , it does not happen .	4.737661406976724

Now , if you take maleic anhydride and copolymerize with something which has a negative value of e .	3.717762314873226

That means they have a electron positive electron rich double bond .	4.096716233976728

Then obviously there will be attraction between the two polar polarities and there will be possibilities for the copolymerization will be much easier .	4.3584556662903085

So , whereas , maleic anhydride does not homopolymerize it can easily copolymerize with butadiene or styrene because their charges are opposite .	2.398636760650899

So , the monomers can attract each other and do the reaction .	5.017900518602423

So , basically now we know that with these how to both Q and e and how the basis of these values Q and e how to experimentally or semi empirically get these values of Q and e in comparison to arbitrarily they assigned values of styrene .	2.866041464825442

And from the these values of Q and e we now can predict whether two monomers can will copolymerize or not and they are for their ranking in their activities also .	2.685188725859328

So , with these we will move to we will basically completed our discussion on radical copolymerization , we will move and discuss very briefly about ionic copolymerization .	3.400972934082601

And ionic copolymerization and not very often done you know , typically as we have said earlier in our discussion earlier lectures that are an carrying out ionic polymerization is always difficult .	2.9554388466584247

So , unless there is a specific requirement like you are making a specialty polymers like then there is no point of making these polymers by these ionic methods .	3.135330798839209

That is why this copolymers are not usually synthesized by doing ionic copolymerization from a mixture of two or more monomers .	3.0993116591171797

But copolymerization is done by ionic polymerization to make block copolymers , where you first make a block of 1 monomer and then add the second block to get a block copolymers .	4.000171697512263

Nonetheless if you compare ionic copolymerization and with radical copolymerization we can understand the differences and the in that way we can understand , say the characteristics of ionic copolymerization .	3.4108307916318648

Now , unlike radical copolymerization this ionic copolymerization is much more selective , you know .	3.754320983774741

Not many monomer they undergo copolymerization , the number of co monomer here you can choose which you can use to make a copolymer by ionic method is limited .	4.388147246473051

And we know that in case of radical copolymerization basically there are numerous options where you can choose two monomers and make a copolymer from there .	4.102913445175019

And we know that cationic copolymer the monomers , which are having electron donating group as a substituent copolymer .	3.882645864382272

We will copolymerize by cationic method and the monomers having electron withdrawing group as a substituent under the copolymerization with ionic method .	2.7636714522338894

Typically or generally the tendency of this copolymerization are towards ideal behavior because when as I said that the number of monomers are limited .	3.668077587220845

So , only those monomers , which are having reactivity towards the cation they undergo cationic polymerization and the monomers , which have reactivity towards and they go they undergo anionic copolymerization .	3.08178044174992

So , we have the monomers which have undergo ionic copolymerization their reactivities are not too different .	3.6359381837242246

So , they typically or generally have a ideal type they make a typically ideal copolymers .	2.6315863443673737

And of course , like a the homopolymerization we have discussed the reactivity of a ionic polymerization , which will depend up on the initiator you are choosing and the medium polarity solvent polarity and the temperature .	3.2583534620687225

So , if you talking about copolymerization the values r will change with the different types of initiators , medium polarity and temperature .	2.8939377584524735

Some examples of the commercial copolymers as you said earlier the styrene is very styrene homo polymer or polystyrene , polystyrene is a very brittle polymer which breaks easily and also its having poor a very poor solvent resistance or chemical resistance .	2.5619579721675714

So , to improve what is done styrene is copolymerized with acrylonitrle , where the amount of acrylonitrle is limited to 10 to 40 percent by which you can or the solvent resistance property of styrene is improved .	2.961730764136169

So , this copolymer has improved solvent resistance property compared to polystyrene , but acrylonitrle is also brittle so poly acrylonitrle .	2.3647463652684038

So , brittle that if this copolymer does not have a significant improvement over , over the polystyrene molecule homo polymer in terms of brittleness .	3.4428068763651964

What is done a styrene butadiene rubber is used , where a rubber butadiene having a low T g it gives a rubbery domains in the copolymers and as a result this copolymer can becomes rubbery or elastomeric .	2.421436142536032

And these copolymers are typically synthesized by emulsion ionic polymerization , these copolymers with high styrene containing high amount of styrene can are used as a latex paint , where the styrene is cross - linked little bit with unsaturated di - carboxylic acid .	2.2978481487399507

And to combine or to improve both the solvent resistance and in and the impact properties of styrene one very common approach is taken is a making a for the star polymer where you have acrilonitrile which improves the solvent resistance , butadiene will improve the impact properties and styrene which gives you the heat resistance properties .	2.4784032760906913

So , this is a very commonly used polymer as a homo polymer as a as such or as blend with some other homo polymers by polystyrene and polycarbonate and others .	3.2311206257761547

Styrene can be cross linked with small amount of divinyl benzeneum cross linker that will make cross linked spheres cross link product , which can be used as a packing material for the columns in size exclusion chromatography .	2.502278681426552

And the other examples of copolymers which are available commercial like ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer unsaturated polysters and so on .	2.6545550459073777

The other examples , but I am not spending much time on discussing those applications here .	3.1819254587164805

What we will do now we will move to the next polymerization method , which is a ring opening polymerization or in short R O P .	3.6851330878854283

Now , the feasibility of this polymerization from a ring to linear product linear monomer to polycyclic monomer to a linear product , like all other reactions depends both on thermodynamic and thermo dynamic and last kinetic factor .	2.2736000471471476

We have discussed this thermodynamic factor earlier also while discussing in ring formation , cyclic formation instead both polymerization if you can recollect from about over a fifth or sixth lecture where we talked about the tendency of cyclic ring formation in state growth polymerization the same logic apply here the thermodynamic factor .	2.4079745600279185

Now if you look the data compare so let us talk about the data .	4.174499825874322

And then we will can understand the thermodynamic factor in a more clearly .	4.252529931652217

Now , this are the data of all the 3 del g Gibbs free energy change enthalpy change and entropy change .	4.3176375323834

Now , I have made T del s to compare and put it in the same scale this is from cyclo alkane liquid cyclo alkane to linear crystalline polymers .	2.637844214437817

Now , when you are talking about cyclohexene these are basically we are talking about polyethylene these are polymers whether you start from a three member four member five member these all leads to polyethylene .	2.7716478363929924

Now , these are these values here shown here these are all semi empirical values , they are not experimentally determined they are semi empirical values .	3.0433812504926503

Now , if you look at the data as the ring size increases from 3 to 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 now the ring the lower number ring 3 and 4 member ring , they are quite highly strained 3 4 member are strained because of 1 angle strain if they are having high energy because of 1 angle strain .	2.4848726268546995

Whereas , 5 member ring are strained due to eclipse confirmation and 7 8 member ring having also strained because of transformations .	2.5335532715201654

Now , if you if you look at this numbers , the enthalpy change on the polymerization from a 3 membered cyclic ring to a linear polymer it is highly negative .	3.9560388764289365

And if you just talk about linear polymers , what about first let us talk about del s now del s will be negative because the monomers are getting joined and making a linear , linear polymer .	2.888891393880961

Now , in if you talk about same molecular weight obviously if you have a larger ring , this number of monomers you require to make the same length of polymers .	4.0105050736060015

So your del s would be less negative , your if your ring size is larger .	3.1590676158860456

So , if you can and if you see that if your ring size increases your del s value is decreasing becoming less and less negative , but if you follow the del g value Gibbs free energy value and del h value they are almost having same trend .	2.7902469920386364

So , basically the polymerization dictated mainly by the enthalpy change because 3 and 4 member ring are highly strained when they open up and polymerize and gives a lot of this energy , which was already which is getting released because of ring opening .	2.503326593036894

Similar also true for high , high rings with size of 7 , 8 carbon .	3.414842717307493

6 member ring is actually little higher than 0 , if you compare slightly higher than 0 .	4.584835977896004

Basically 6 member ring is not thermodynamically feasible the opening ring the opening polymerization of 6 member ring is not thermodynamically feasible .	2.5736610712051355

So , basically now from this thermodynamic data we know that it is easy ring open polymerize easy to carry out ring opening polymerization on 3 , 4 member ring and say 7 ring .	3.258613048515697

5 member ring also will polymerize by ring opening method .	3.9329339500033793

However , can you make take a say 3 member ring or a 4 member ring or say 5 member ring .	3.240792463617754

Can you make polyethylene by this route this way , can you make polyethylene from either of this either of this by ring opening polymerization ?	2.806981944618326

The answer is no because it is not only determining by determined by thermodynamic feasibility , there has to be kinetic path way through which you can carry out the polymerization .	3.3491688758573845

Basically this is saturated ring and there is no place where u can carry out a electrophilic or neutrophillic character by external and open the ring , and then carry out the polymerization .	2.7460705611723326

And then which can react with another ring cyclic molecules and let the chin propagate .	3.7719145380809764

So , what we basically need what we basically no that simple cyclic rings like cyclo pentain or cyclo butane they do not undergo reopening polymerization .	2.359903981063962

You require a ether atom , which will actually enabled electrophilic or a nucleophilic attack by external agents by which the rings will open .	2.5558015833963754

And then start the propagation reaction and which will finally , lead to a polymer molecule .	5.368030615053715

So , the types of monomers we there is a there is a different structure where basically these are the types of monomer , you can do a re - opening polymerization .	4.575245134123811

So , basically all have a hetero atom in the ring , whether it is a or ester or amides whatever is the case .	3.5341935595401033

Now , that actually enables a from external agents which will be open first and then propagate .	3.2776463819418056

This is this will form and get poly posphogen , if you have a cyclic cyloxin molecule it open up to give you linear poly cyle oxide .	3.177253703007186

If You have a lactone give you poly ester if you have a lactum , it will cyclo lactum it will give you a linear poly amide molecules .	3.555012435676278

Now , the chart of the thermodynamic feasibility what we shown that was for ring cyclo alkenes not this type of monomers , where you have a hetero atom .	3.1262867416987428

So , the absolute value in this graph will change , if we consider now a cyclic ring hetero atom or the teams remains more or less same .	2.6775874320246964

So , again the strain of you know thermodynamic feasibility will decrease as you increase from c to c and then again go up if you increase the ring size .	3.1424201901262396

So , basically if you have cyclic ethers say tetra hydro firen or a di oxine they do not undergo polymerization .	3.0739305249082296

Whereas this actually undergo ring opening polymerization .	4.681764034598265

Now , let ’ s talk about few characteristics of a ring opening polymerization , and talk about the mechanism and kinetics of a ring opening polymerization .	3.259121889875822

Now , as we discussed if you have a cyclic ring here , then you need first to ring open the ring to open up and then start the propagation reaction .	3.327087757884006

Now , see here radical initiator see radical initiator , now it is unlikely that this will inter act or react with this and ring opening , that is not very feasible .	3.0223220616706765

So , you either need a cation or a anion to sort of initiate a ring polymerization so initiation by… In case of ring opening polymerization the initiation is done by the same types of ionic initiators as in the case of ionic polymerization of carbon carbon double bonds .	3.0310446402493505

We have discussed in length about cation polymerization or an anionic polymerization of carbon carbon double bond .	3.38243183103965

So , radicals radical initiator is not a basically feasible in terms of in case of ring opening polymerization .	4.8737294192688045

Now , because we are talking about initiation by ionic initiator so you have those different types of species , covalent specious between the ion and counter ion with it present as a covalence specious or ion pair or free ion goes different types of association between the reaction center and the possible .	2.7597764199886323

Hence there is tremendous effect of the solvent and the counters ion in case of ring opening polymerization as well , as was in the case of the linear ionic polymerization of the double bond .	4.501838922408467

See if you have a lactum your opening up and making a polyester or you have a lactum you are opening up and making a poly amide .	3.1962861664408044

Now , poly ester poly amides are typically synthesized we have discussed earlier they are synthesized by stiff polymerization , but in this case we are making the same types of polymers , which we knew till now that they are typically synthesized by step growth polymerization .	3.3777941924450245

They can be synthesized by ring opening polymerization from the cyclic monomers as well , and the mechanism here is chain polymerization .	3.6416470664840888

So , basically a propagating chain a chain propagates and the monomers get added and the chain ends .	4.1517669391879855

So , the chain keep on propagating there is no reaction between two monomers or there is no reaction between two high molecular polymer chain as well .	3.463054207134946

The same as the chain polymerization and in because you are talking about ionic polymerization in most cases they are leaving and we know that bi molecular term is not possible for ionic polymerization .	4.395263920454778

If you take care of the reaction medium very well so that there is no impurities in these polymers that are leaving .	4.383215670160293

So , you can make block of polymers of functional polymers at the end of the reaction , and in this case unlike a linear polymerization of the vinyl molecules , polymerization de polymerization equilibrium is very important .	3.478659678735624

Now , one different this ring opening polymerization with the normal chain polymerization , we know is that the rate constant for propagation is in its several order of maginitude lower than normal chain polymerization , it is actually of same order like in case of step growth polymerization .	3.3163841505932607

So , though this is a chain polymerization , but the reaction rate or the propagation rate constant is having much lower value compared to several order of magnitude growth in comparison to normal chain polymerization .	3.8245740009373184

And the values are similar to the step growth polymerization values .	5.200989081983511

So , the reaction is slower compared to your normal chain polymerization and as you know that we discussed this most cases this are leaving .	4.824145516233542

So , the molecular weight of ring opening polymerization is dependent on the conversion .	5.09407930173383

So , higher the conversion the higher the molecular weight .	5.684788838654106

And also you can control the estimate or predict the molecular weight form the ration of monomer and the initiator as in the case of other leaving polymerization we know .	3.909074999426294

So , unlike step growth polymerization here you have control you can control the molecular weight by the ratio of monomer and initiator .	4.753889428354318

And like the step growth polymerization the molecule will depend upon the conversion , but in case of step growth the high molecules are only get high conversion .	3.5491498784483095

But in case of ring opening you get slow increase in the molecular weight with the or the linear increase over the molecular weight with the conversion of monomer .	4.262907230289144

Now , examples of before we come to examples let ’ s talk about the mechanism part of how , what are the ways this ring opening polymerization done if we know this is ionic polymerization… So , let ’ s first talk about anionic R O P now the initiator is initiated by as I said same similar ionic initiators as in the case of linear chain anionic polymerization , like metal hydroxides alkoxides metal hydroxides or metal alkoxides or metal oxides etc .	2.553793681063304

Or like we discussed alkyl metal alkyl lithium or aryl metal you can use to initiate the anionic chain polymerization or radical anion also anionic species like sodium , naphthalene they also they are same types of initiator , as we talked about the our discussion on anionic chain polymerization .	2.971807443970301

Say you talk about say alkyl metal initiator you have a alkyl metal initiator , say I take a ethylene oxide .	4.523577885462743

Now , there is a nucleophilic attack by this initiator and the ring will open up .	3.731101073102449

So , you have this now this will again react with another monomer in similar way .	4.123634121599029

So , you can write the general you can increase the number of state and you will get a your polymerization .	5.094577003732218

Now , as I said that like other anionic polymerization this is a living polymerization .	4.385060268379549

So , this at the end of the reaction if remains like this you can add a second monomer and you can block a polymer .	3.9753796159145582

If you want to terminate the reaction you can exchange these with a say adding some water or alcohol , and then you can exchange like other we discussed earlier .	3.3093299106328375

Now , if we talk about a cationic ring opening polymerization .	4.707329331115719

Now , here typically its strong protonic acids like say tri floro acetic acid or say fluoro sulfonic acid or say triflic acid which are the way this , this are our acids which are very strong acid are required to initiate a ring opening polymerization .	2.5332978208302914

Now , let us say have so this will say talk about now a 4 member ether , now in this case there is a nucleophilic atom of the oxygen to the proton and you get , you actually form secondary oxonium ion , in all this cases you have a counter end associated with that you this will react with another monomer and propagate in the chain .	2.945431960818297

So , can you make a polymer like this , this will form secondary oxomium ion this is , now we have been talking that we need a very a very strong acid because if you counter ion have sufficient acid is not that strong then this counter ion will have sufficient necleophillicity to either set up the oxonium ion or a proton and stop the reaction there itself .	2.7407585573182085

So , for that you require very strong acids so that the necleophillicity of the counter ion will not be enough to compete with the addition of monomer or the reaction of monomer with the oxonium ion .	3.7756842500442023

Similarly , if we have little bit of moisture present in the medium or if you have water molecules , then this will easily compete with your monomer with oxinium ion and then terminate the or disrupt the reaction immediately .	3.142071274983474

So , like earlier when you talk about cationic polymerization here also you need to have a very stringent requirement of so that you do not have a moisture , any moisture present in the system .	3.9001639332655054

Now , other types of initiators we talked about the catalyst and co catalyst like B F 3 and H 2 O catalyst and other types can be also used in this cationic ring opening polymerization also .	3.504250383708937

At the end as a this will remain leaving the only thing in case of cationic polymerization , as you can imagine that if your chain is having…is a linear chain at the end you have a cationic group and anionic counter end then you can oxygen here , then it can do intra molecular reaction and form a linear molecule as a ring molecule .	3.2724235765698033

Now , where it can also react with a another linear molecules and then stop this chain and form a sight in middle of another chain .	3.431485192572089

So , form there a branching can happen so this are the side reactions where chain transfer takes place intra molecularly with in the chain form a ring structure and another linear molecule .	2.682174630416087

Or if there are intra molecular chain transfer reaction happen then there will be possibility of in this case .	5.020823290815132

And this case also you want to stop the reaction , you can add agent through which by which it can external agents which will terminate the cationic chain .	4.130326225834355

Now , with this I think we have discussed the ring opening polymerization , now let ’ s talk about few examples of commercial reopening polymerization , this are the typical this are the polymers which are available commercially which are made by ring opening polymerization .	3.6943108903980457

For example , poly ethylene oxide and poly proplyne oxide they are synthesized by anionic opening corresponding cyclic monomer of ethylene oxide , and propylene oxides .	2.6984296254681195

Poly tera hydrofuran can be synthesized or the cationic ring opening polymerization of tetra hydro furan polyacetals are synthesized by cationic reopening polymerization of trioxane .	2.7768684184951504

And as I gave examples of aliphatic polyesters from lactones and polyamides from lactones and this is also very common where linear poly siloxanes or silicons are synthesized by anionic or cationic polymers of cyclic siloxanes so with these we end our discussion of ring opening polymerization .	2.398431297808393

And in the next lecture we will start our discussion on stereo chemistry of polymerization and subsequently in other lecture , we will talk about coordination polymerization .	3.9338865573112347

So , we will start stereo chemistry of polymers and polymerization process in our next lecture .	3.8637697589057236

Today we will discuss two of those cases that do not represent the reaction velocity profile in terms of hyperbolic kinetics .	4.15153313846561

One of them is substrate inhibition the other is sigmoidal kinetics particularly as it applies to multisite and allosteric enzymes .	2.82297591977464

If you look into the reaction profile , a typical substrate verses initial reaction velocity profile , for a hyperbolic kinetics goes like this with an asymptotic reaction velocity Vm .	2.666575181948523

In the case of substrate inhibition the reaction velocity when you increase substrate concentration does not reach to a saturation level rather even earlier than that it deviates and passes through a maximum .	2.641876033123963

When substrate concentration goes high the reaction velocity starts dropping and does not retain saturation level .	3.6993895143086135

On the other hand in the sigmoidal kinetics instead of a reaction profile being represented by rectangular hyperbola it is in the form of a sigma .	2.8848632004222847

Ultimately it can reach the same kind of saturation behavior but the initial profile will be different in the case of a sigmoidal profile .	3.5280630186417214

Coming to the first case of substrate inhibition , the reaction profile passes through a maximum and at a particular substrate concentration it reaches a maximum value and then it starts dropping .	3.5771530730795433

This substrate concentration corresponds to maximum reaction velocity .	4.421680414261013

This substrate concentration corresponding to maximum reaction velocity is not really something which is corresponding to maximum reaction velocity of enzyme catalyzed reaction .	3.454590045596417

It is as a result of certain enzyme substrate interactions such that the rate gets tapered even before the saturation level reaches .	3.372616869915632

This effect can also be visualized when you look for the classical Lineweaver plot .	4.059270631602314

Instead of giving you a straight line it becomes convexed to the x axis and it can meet .	3.681043591190198

That can give an indication that the enzyme catalyzed reaction is having some kind of a substrate .	4.556629177517101

There are number of examples in practice for such kind of a behavior in the reaction .	4.07087554162737

One of the most conventional and simplest examples could be hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose by invertase .	2.699792636145532

A very classical example , where at a substrate concentration of greater than 0.1M , 0.1M is not a very high substrate concentration , is about say 3.4 or 3.5 % .	3.9424675592598843

Even at that level the effect of substrate concentration inhibition is noticed and the reaction velocity starts dropping .	4.202842822338206

Another example of substrate inhibition is in the form of succinic dehydrogenase which catalyzes the interconversion of succinate to fumerate , a reaction which catalyzes the formation of a double bond .	3.139506327730077

Succinate as a substrate has two carboxylic groups .	5.639891756741072

As per the normal function of the enzyme the two carboxylic groups of the substrate are required to be bound to the enzyme molecule .	4.859103007045879

When substrate concentration becomes very high , the possibility or the statistical feasibility of one carboxylic group from each of the two substrate molecule binding to the same enzyme molecule becomes much higher .	3.650635878902421

In that process when the two substrate molecules gets bound to one enzyme molecule and one carboxylic group of each of the substrate molecule then the reaction is not catalyzed and then ultimate enzyme substrate complex is a dead end complex .	3.4649201863036945

The structure of succinic acid is - OOC - CH2 - CH2 - COO - .	3.465989436119168

As per the normal reaction of succinic dehydrogenase two carboxylic group of substrate molecule are required to be bound to the enzyme active sites and at low concentration of substrate this can very well happen .	3.2317604278401038

So therefore the active sites are not functional yet because instead of one molecule there are two molecules attached and the enzyme substrate complex so results in the form of dead end complex which doesn ’ t go into the final product forming stage .	3.385414857572287

For such a reaction there is a feasibility that you may end up in an enzyme molecule having such kind of a confirmation , instead of having the two carboxylic group of the same substrate molecule bound to the enzyme , there are two substrate molecules bound to the same enzyme and one carboxylic group of each of the substrate molecule and such a complex does not form the product .	3.7932779613257575

Similarly in the case of hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase also by one of the possible mechanistic models when one substrate molecule binds , the enzyme substrate complex leads to a product formation .	3.6456268845321946

If the enzyme is bound to two substrate molecule a dead end complex is formed .	4.277085597902305

A simple reaction mechanism can be expressed like E + S ES E + P + S ESS We can write exactly in our nomenclature of k1 , k - 1 , k2 and this equilibrium of the second substrate binding can be expressed by dissociation constant of Ks , individual rate constant being ks and k - s .	2.9424914752104323

This ESS is a dead end complex .	4.756901081640651

That means the product formation will take place from the substrate complex .	4.794239627796992

This will not lead to any product formation and whatever fraction of the total enzyme is bound in the form of ESS will not participate in the reaction with the result that reaction velocity will drop .	3.714644702955455

That means at the saturation level you are assuming that the entire enzyme is bound to the substrate .	3.9457346064250864

The entire enzyme is not bound to the substrate here .	6.501761895745902

Increasing the substrate concentration leads to more of ESS formation .	4.9502745203857055

On the basis of equilibrium kinetics one can write the rate expression of such a system as Vi / Vm = S Km + S ( 1 + S / Ks ) The Vm is the true maximum reaction velocity if there was no such substrate inhibition to take place and Km is , the classical ( k - 1 + k2 / k1 ) , the Michaelis Menten constant and ks is the dissociation constant of the second substrate binding .	3.254911841759307

This can also be written as Vi = Vm S / Km + S + S2 / Ks If you plot such profile the rate expression will pass through maxima and if you differentiate that dv over ds and equate it to zero you will end up in maxima and the maximum reaction velocity will be obtained at substrate concentration which is Sm = vKm .	3.0047931025168904

In such cases you notice that such enzymes do not really strictly follow the typical Michaelis Menten kinetics .	2.743157238088433

There are another group of enzymes which are multisite .	5.02258009782529

The chemical nature of the enzyme provides for a quaternary structure in some cases and the quaternary structure is composed of multiple subunits arranged in a particular fashion so that their interaction brings in the confirmation thereby active sites are created .	3.1708013795696464

These multisite enzymes are alphabetic in nature which consists of more than one sub units and very often these subunits might be identical .	2.948599053693386

Each subunit may have an active site for enzyme catalyzed reaction , multiple active sites per enzyme molecule .	3.464937827824268

There are two kinds of situation one is that these active sites on these oligomeric enzymes might be identical and independent .	3.415873366665429

Notice the two terms which I have highlighted here .	5.124131612571014

Identical means the catalytic sites have identical free energy change of binding .	4.744681128071842

That means free energy of binding on either site is same and it does not matter to which site the substrate molecule binds first or second ; it makes no different .	3.0999556635959875

Very often it might happen that initially the binding sites may be identical and they are free , free for the substrate to bind to any one of them .	3.8920766946370247

But when we talk of allosteric enzyme we are talking of a favorable interaction .	4.277686638909332

Multisite enzymes have identical , independent subunits .	5.260060534875846

In such cases when all the catalytic sites on the enzyme molecule , even look at its different subunits , if they are identical and non - interacting or non - cooperative , they have no interaction among each other .	2.7501708212123126

The net result will be that you are handling something like if you consider that let us say one nano mole of an enzyme substrate concentration of n binding sites per mole will be equal to n pico mole of one binding site molecule .	3.4899812992109593

The rate profile will be hyperbolic in nature .	4.048267575502654

The only difference is that the maximum reaction velocity term in that case will be n.K2.Et .	4.479644790171438

That means maximum reaction velocity in the case of single binding site is Vm = K2 E0 If there are n binding sites the only difference will be , it will become Vm = n .	3.666248971151627

K2 E0 because all the n binding sites have to be saturated .	4.659216325149633

That means all the binding sites are equal .	5.418418311076799

They don ’ t influence the binding to other site .	3.798243506355129

The first binding site is occupied , the second binding site is free and depending on substrate concentration it can bind and form a binary complex where the two substrate molecules are bind that means both the binding sites .	3.319814606914751

The only difference will be when SES gives you a product and the rate of product formation will be 2k2 because it will lead to ES + P and SE + P .	3.6358253904870184

Similarly here also you can have a product formation to P + E .	5.581216558544425

You can have from either direction the product formation and they are independent .	4.988698099809251

Similar situation might arise for a tetramer or a hexamer depending on the number of binding sites on the enzyme molecule .	3.1986117595566097

For such a simple case the rate expression can be written as V / Vm = S / ks + S2 / ks2 1 + 2S / Ks + S2 / ks2 Consider that the enzyme molecule has binding sites on both the sides , S and ES .	4.014838813365568

The only difference is S represents one active site and ES represents the other binding site that is occupied .	2.899248012291377

That means that whether it binds on left hand site or right hand site the binding of the next substrate on to the vacant site has no effect .	3.0097728650772404

Both the binding sites can dissociate independently and lead to formation of a single enzyme substrate complex plus product .	4.041201870318222

That means all the seats in this class are totally vacant .	3.399668969146733

Anybody who gets into the room can occupy any of the seats and as many numbers of students can come in as long as they can occupy the number of seats available .	3.178670742968114

Only difference you must notice is Vm term will correspond to Vm = 2k2 .E0 rather than Es .	2.7125014908972056

Eventually it will lead to that .	8.02172196813564

If suppose the entire enzyme SES is in this form , both these sites are totally saturated because ES and SE also will lead to the product formation .	3.2067353998302797

The net effect will be that SES is giving you two products and the free enzyme .	3.187204027840862

The only difference is here the definition of Vm must be taken as 2K2 .E0 or in another words if it is a multimeric protein or enzyme where n binding sites are there , it can become n.K2.E0 Otherwise the treatment can be identical as in the case of a hyperbolic profile .	2.87766679526339

This in general you can write as V / Vm = S / Ks ( 1 + S / Ks ) n - 1 ( 1 + S / Ks ) n If you just extrapolate the number of binding sites from two to four to six to n , these are the kind of rate expression you end up .	3.5653823930633792

This is equal to V / Vm = S / Ks = S / Ks + S ( 1 + S / Ks ) which is same as hyperbolic rate expression .	4.638509286186259

In the second and more complex case when we talk of co - operative binding if you consider two binding sites on enzyme molecule they may be identical .	3.8220486252182995

That means the free energy change for binding process may be the same .	3.8945611790616184

That is what we mean by identical binding sites .	4.738559546829642

That means to start with the substrate molecule can hook up to any of them irrespective of the choice but after it gets bound it makes a conformational change on the enzyme molecule .	3.1465575891591557

That means it influences the confirmation of the other binding sites therefore altering its affinity .	3.366331210676217

There are number of mechanistic hypothesis which have been proved .	4.709721922222513

We will come to that .	6.12619584258785

The first binding site is free for all the substrate molecule and once this is bound if it makes a change on the confirmation of the other binding sites such that the affinity of the substrate to the binding site gets altered , if you want a positive favorable effect , the affinity must increase or the Km value must decrease , dissociation constant must decrease .	3.04718534773618

If the km value of the subsequent binding sites decreases with the binding of the first substrate molecule we call it co - operative binding .	4.213632201519738

The significance of co - operative binding lies in actual practice in the case of allosteric enzymes .	3.5834934594030337

All of you know probably with your background in the biochemical metabolism that with each metabolic path way you have certain regulatory enzymes which behave in allosteric manner .	2.500912744572486

By allosteric manner I mean that substrate binding process in case of those enzymes is co - operative in nature and they do not exhibit the typical hyperbolic kinetics rather they exhibit sigmoidal kinetics .	2.9484924097625176

If you just compare the two kinds of profiles , this is a sigmoidal profile and this is the hyperbolic profile .	4.811527377174523

For two different enzymes which are coincidentally having the same velocity at substrate concentration let us say nine arbitrary units in both the cases whether it follows a hyperbolic kinetics or sigmoidal kinetics the enzyme velocity reaches the same value at a particular substrate concentration .	2.7245426460280138

Only initial phase changes and the first one is typical hyperbolic profile , the second one is the sigmoidal profile which is exhibited by allosteric enzymes .	3.0461773077147396

The allosteric behavior has in some way an advantageous situation for the regulatory enzymes to function .	2.7441666239033498

The role of regulatory enzymes in a metabolic pathway is the control of metabolic pathway .	3.1881898899559675

That means it should be able to switch on and off the path way with a very subtle change in substrate concentration .	3.4827877189313825

These two profiles have identical reaction velocity at high substrate concentration .	3.551606051257648

For the two enzymes to act , in the early phases when substrate concentration increases from zero to three arbitrary units whatever are the units , in the case of sigmoidal kinetics the reaction velocity is only 0.1 in some arbitrary units .	2.9288718116473738

Whereas in the case of a saturation kinetics or hyperbolic kinetics the reaction velocity can reach to almost 0.75 , 75 % of the saturation value , a very high level .	3.430585311027643

That means at a very small change of concentration , the reaction velocity can be very high .	4.830952101954081

In the case of saturation kinetics or hyperbolic kinetics the ratio of the concentration of substrates for the two levels to reach will be almost about twenty seven times .	3.116289721321609

That means at 0.1 , it can reach only at a very small substrate concentration here .	3.903499792370275

The ratio is twenty seven fold .	5.040033292150289

On the other hand in the case of sigmoidal kinetics this ratio is only 2.3 .	3.229322905723854

In the case of living cells the intercellular concentration of substrate does not change over a very large range .	4.105678238692745

Whereas for control purposes it will require a very small concentration change by which the reaction velocity can be regulated and that is what can happen in the case of a sigmoidal kinetics .	4.059155230883692

That means just by changing concentration ratio of two to three fold you will notice that the reaction velocity can be altered from 0.1 to 0.75 and that is the advantage with this kind of reaction behavior the regulatory enzymes obtained in the case of cellular metabolism With this kind of a kinetic behavior the enzymes are able to act almost like an on and off switch .	3.2298193902590415

That means if the substrate concentration comes down reaction velocity is very slow ; the metabolic pathway is slowed down ; it is not made to zero .	3.8038207934558512

If the substrate concentration slightly increases the pathway is fully on and the product formation or whatever is corresponding intermediate in pathway are fully available and that advantage provides to the cellular metabolism .	2.5583777102718837

Such a behavior of sigmoidal kinetics has been very appropriately explained at least by two mechanistic hypotheses .	2.804764867486292

One and probably in its simplest form is on the basis of sequential interaction model .	3.382760138008748

This is an extension of Koshland ’ s induced fit hypothesis which we discussed when we were talking about the specificity and how the enzymes obtain their specific action .	2.939714558967503

We talked about the Koshland ’ s induced fit hypothesis whereby when the substrate molecule binds to one of the binding sites the enzyme undergo a conformational change so as to fit on to the substrate molecule .	3.7310842043398535

For each binding of the substrate to a binding site the affinity reduces by a factor let us say a , as interaction factor .	3.7116916748453717

That is what you see in a diagrammatic picture like here .	3.9458949996713053

If this is the free enzyme which has two binding sites , identical binding sites the substrate molecule binds first to let us say , A .	4.635957647892203

It immediately brings in a conformational change on the second binding site whereby the dissociation constant reduces to a Ks .	3.4165518945529807

The conformational change leads to the dissociation constant or Michaelis Menten constant for the second binding site and then second binding site also gets bound .	3.8072574618231037

It is logical that if this dissociation constant is low the substrate will have much more affinity for the second binding site .	3.6463564230869436

Similarly if it initially binds with Ks on to other binding site it can influence the conformational change on the other binding site and it can meet .	3.21535118540643

Both the binding sites are occupied and such a system can be represented by a mechanistic model whereby you have the first binding as Ks either here or here .	3.009471350882908

The second binding process is represented by dissociation constant of a Ks either here or here .	3.349381940958406

The product formation with ES will be E + P .	5.015847868612554

Similarly when both the binding sites are occupied , the product formation rate will be twice the Kp because then it can go either to SE or ES , there is no difference .	3.359834928003214

The situation which I have shown here is rather too simplistic .	4.304500032618128

That means we have tried to explain with the two binding sites .	4.020850434578403

In many cases particularly with the regulatory enzymes , the number of binding sites may be four or six or eight even tetramers are a very common example in the literature and therefore the rate expression will be quite complex and their analysis can become difficult .	3.0687044480933867

To simplify the situation there is an equation available corresponding to Michaelis Menten equation which can be applied to allosteric enzymes .	3.9110771604731753

This was given by Hill .	7.549251965229227

One of the basic assumptions here which we made is that the interaction factors , what I mentioned earlier as Ks and a Ks , the ratio alpha is very , very small than one .	3.1287060801297724

That means the co - operativity is very high .	4.695188614550287

Once a substrate molecule binds to one of the binding sites it makes a drastic conformational change so that the affinity is increased very significantly .	3.9746841314688077

If you consider n binding sites what will happen in such a situation is that with each binding site being occupied by the substrate , the next subsequent binding sites will have much more affinity .	3.2841797699575546

Ultimately at equilibrium or in steady state condition the net effect will be that the bulk of the enzyme will be in the form of ESS .	4.265325160133699

Theoretically at equilibrium the enzyme must be available in the form of E , ES , ES2 , …… , ESn .	4.317361131581209

Normally if there are n binding sites and the binding process continues sequentially then the enzyme must be available in different species in difference forms as E , ES , ES2 , up to ESn .	3.113806220306366

But if the interaction factor alpha is very , very small , at each stage affinity will increase by a very significant level or what we understand as co - operativity is very high .	2.91975304900972

In that case the assumption by Hill was that most of the enzyme will exist in the form of ESn .	4.0891140457176025

There will be small concentrations but they can be neglected .	5.610514782675913

Based on that assumption then he gave a rate expression which is v / Vm = Sn / K ’ + Sn This is called Hills equation .	2.7144416794110717

Here n is the number of binding sites per enzyme molecule and K ’ is the Hill ’ s constant .	4.04550663742963

This K ’ is different than the Michaelis Menten constant .	5.484250712014983

Michaelis Menten constant is the substrate concentration at which reaction velocity is 50 % of that of the maximum reaction velocity .	5.482122011377991

That situation will not apply here , if you analyze .	4.64913400457287

If you put n = 1 , then the equation will get into Michaelis Menten kinetics .	3.131682632492751

Vm here is the maximum reaction velocity when all the binding sites are occupied by the substrate .	5.104518960920692

The substrate concentration is high enough but again this is not identical to the Vm of the Michaelis Menten equation because Vm of the Michaelis Menten equation is an asymptotic value .	3.529334486127644

You can never approach it practically .	5.031668806462484

It is a theoretical value .	6.319905557013775

Whereas in this case of Vm , you can approach to that value when all the enzyme binding sites are totally occupied by the substrate molecule .	4.176230641461957

If you just take the same yardstick of explaining K ’ as we have taken in the case of Michaelis Menten equation , v = 0.5 Vm you will end up as Sn0.5 = K ’ in the case of Hill ’ s equation .	3.357440395439212

Or S0.5 substrate concentration for 50 % maximum reaction velocity is nvK ’ .	5.374162939421991

It was half of the maximum reaction velocity their .	6.162785842942363

So that brings in a distinction between the two parameters that we are talking about .	5.050346733551963

The level of s means the level of co - operativity for different enzymes as to how much it deviates from the hyperbolic performance or how much more efficient it is in terms of regulatory behavior .	2.929735223151531

When we talked about the ratio of two substrate concentration for two levels of reaction velocity the smaller it is , it is a better regulatory system .	4.06090161873252

Very sharp change in substrate concentration can bring in the regulation .	3.923414198985113

Similarly one can express the co - operativity index of any given allosteric enzyme by expressing it in terms of the ratio of substrate concentration for achieving two different levels of reaction velocity .	3.263855518213926

As conventional practice we take the two reaction velocity as 0.9 Vm and 0.1 Vm .	4.298225256261663

That means 10 % and 90 % and the ratio of the two , S0.9 / S0.1 is conventionally called as co - operativity index .	4.554352706997351

This is just a conventional practice .	5.6508105488783995

You can define co - operativity index as long as you mention ; if it is S0.75 / S0.1 or S0.9 / S0.1 , or it could be any ratio .	4.514048796966244

It can be used to express co - operativity index .	5.344976027635311

It is only a matter of convention that we are following the ratio of 90 % and 10 % values .	4.7889061304011

If you just get the value of S0.9 and S0.1 you know original hills equation v / Vm = Sn / K ’ + Sn S0.9 = nv9 K ’ , S0.1 = nvK ’ / 9 and the co - operativity index will be nv81 .	2.5857702800825995

Or in another words n will be equal to n = log81 / log S0.9 / S0.1 Therefore n is the number of binding sites .	3.6353253656145506

If one can determine the value of S0.9 / S0.1ratio , one can determine the number of binding sites .	5.288039391751352

Number of binding sites , n theoretically should be an integer .	4.081282993233931

Number of binding sites will be one , four , two , three , five any integer .	3.413415242902228

But practically if you notice you will never get an integer value .	3.085382242391267

The reason is the basic assumption in the hills equation is that the enzyme at equilibrium will be in the form of ESn whereas there will be small concentration of all other enzyme species .	3.7670062708501835

That means with a partly substrate bound form and so therefore the final value of n will be in fraction .	3.0922294613933095

As a matter of conventional practice if we get let us say 3.6 , we consider the next integer that is binding sites are four because the number of binding sites if we get less is primarily because of the other not completely saturated enzyme molecule .	3.1405837913103998

If you want to plot this expression you get v / Vm = Sn / K ’ + Sn You can simplify this to get nlogS + log ( Vm - v ) / v = log K ’ log v / ( Vm - v ) = nlogS – log K ’ If you make a log log plot of log S verses log v / Vm - v , you must end up in a straight line with the slope of n and on log log plot you will straight get a slope and get the number of binding sites .	2.6422388117404036

At a value of log S if you put v / Vm - v as one , the log format will be zero .	3.3033705296727174

I am putting v / Vm - v as one and at that value the corresponding value of log S will be log S0.5 .	3.010320148480506

That means if you recall the log S0.5 what we deduced earlier from our equation was nlogS0.5 = log K ’ If you know the slope and determine the value of n and also determine log S0.5 that means substrate concentration for 50 % of maximum reaction velocity you can get the value of K ’ what is known commonly as Hill ’ s constant .	2.8558800786251157

So that gives you a neat analytical procedure to define your kinetic behavior of the allosteric enzymes that are available in the living systems mostly for regulatory purposes .	3.1579455569220887

Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry .	2.3210412329127847

We will continue our discussion on polymer molecular weight determination from our last class .	4.049421798122507

We had started the discussion on light scattering by which we can determine the weight average molecular weight of a polymer sample .	4.281436753935384

And then we will start the discussion on gel permeation chromatography on the later part of this lecture .	3.836825669121416

We will not finish this discussion on gel permeation chromatography in this lecture ; we will continue in the next lecture .	3.1382118379450623

Now , this is where we left in the last lecture .	4.234492444534599

This is the equation based on the basic Rayleigh scattering equation and the fluctuation theories of Einstein and Smoluchowski ; and we explained the terms K c is the concentration in gram per unit volume ; delta R theta is the excess Rayleigh ratio , which is the Rayleigh ratio of the polymer molecules or the solute molecules in excess of the solvent molecules .	3.1928861254569516

It is the second variant coefficient from which is related to polymer solvent interaction parameter and M is the molar mass .	4.326159985016036

Now , this expression becomes not useful or become erratic when the size of the solute molecule grows .	3.1777604773520536

If the size goes , this equation is valid for isotropic scatterer which basically have dimension radius less than lambda dash by 20 ; lambda dash is the wavelength of the incident light in the solvent .	2.6317943731760085

So , for those small molecules the excess Rayleigh ratio is does not depend on the theta is basically have same value for a different angles and we call this is isotropic scatterer ; remember , this we are talking about excess Rayleigh ratio not the scattering intensity .	2.968388139830736

Now , if the size of the solute molecule goes up and becomes sufficiently large so that radius is of the order of lambda dash by 20 .	3.4198261866741824

For example , if we talking about laser having 633 nanometer wavelength then it is about say 15 or 30 nanometer ; we are talking about lambda dash by 20 ; or if you take a laser wavelength little lower at the beginning of the visible light then it will be around twenty nanometer .	3.200804390851729

So , it is basically these value depends the cut off value where this angular dependence starts depends upon the wavelength of the incident light which we are using .	2.8405482438416367

Now , in this case the excess Rayleigh ratio is angle dependent and it has larger value or the highest value at 0 angle ; and as we increase the value of the scattering angle , the value for this excess Rayleigh ratio start decreasing .	3.412197127372565

Why does it happen ?	9.844487059837785

This happens , because if the size grows safe if you have a polymer molecule like this and this is in the solution .	6.703179686153408

Now , you have incident radiation coming and it is getting scattered from here , and it is going to the detector at 0 angle .	3.8982229879337376

Similarly , there is another part also can scatter light and it is going to the detector .	4.304664660688038

Now , if this is detected at 0 angle there is no phase lag between two scattered radiations as they travelled the same distance .	2.820315689605225

So , basically there is no destructive interference at theta is equal to 0 .	4.311150438392975

But you have to consider these at an angle other than 0 ; for example , if I consider this theta then , because these two scattered light have a phase difference they will have a destructive interference between them .	3.238238305247202

Then as a result , i theta will be less than i theta equals to 0 .	4.261841140756509

So , scattering intensity will be lower or excess Rayleigh ratio will be lower in this case then what it was in case of theta equals to 0 .	4.520484952425408

As a result , there will be more destructive interference between the scattered lights from different parts of the polymer molecules ; this scattered lights are from different parts of a polymer molecules .	3.590385015063119

So , this diminishing of the excess Rayleigh ratio at a higher angle than 0 is because of the destructive interference between the scattered light from different parts of same molecule or as a result of intra molecular destructive interference ; and the higher is the angle , the excess Rayleigh ratio becomes even smaller .	2.8005425231125582

So , this shows what we explain in just now .	3.606030406439552

So , the same what is explained in a minute .	4.39398461260394

So , the angular variation of scattered light is directly related to the size of the molecule ; the larger is the size there will be more variation , because there will be more destructive interference because of the scattered light which is coming from intra molecular different regions ; and this starts around as I said lambda dash by 20 , it is starts this destructive .	3.2423446921809167

So , see intensity of the scattered light actually becomes also proportional in addition to it become depend up on the molar mass , concentration and d n by d c square , it also depends up on the P theta which we call the form factor or angular scattering factor .	2.661391288412393

And P theta value is 1 at 0 theta equals to 0 , because you do not see any destructive interference and for all other angles P theta become less than one , and it becomes more and more small as we increase the theta .	3.1466810909761045

So , at theta goes up , P theta goes down in value .	3.2626259589469946

So , basically now by studying the angular variation of P theta we can get information about the size of the polymer molecules .	3.789009513723037

So , now , we modify the original equations for small point scatterer with a term P theta which is an angular scattering factor and as I said this becomes one for theta equals to 0 , and becomes less than 1 for any other value for theta .	2.656545839314

And , Debye and Guinier actually established a relationship or deduced a relationship for equation for P theta for a mono dispersed Gaussian coil which is the case for a polymer coil ; P theta can be written like this where again the terms are self - explanatory ; s square is the radius of gyration ; this z is not there , maybe we can remove this z for time being .	2.518115304281808

So , for mono dispersed Gaussian current this is the equation where s square is the radius of gyration ; sometimes , it also written as R g square which is basically radius of gyration .	3.0640698312907344

So , we can combine these two equations and we get this expression ; this covers the original scattering equation by Rayleigh and fluctuation theories of Einstein and Smoluchowski , and this is formed by Debye and Guinier which quantify the e theta term ; angular dependence term .	2.522534420296546

Now , this valid for dilute solution when no intermolecular interference and this also valid for low scattering angles which comes to an equation from like this .	2.3366761234441724

So , finally , we have this expression and if we consider a poly dispersed polymer coil normally we have the polymer chains are not mono dispersed , they are poly dispersed .	3.72296358107914

It can be shown that this M is M w and this s square is s square z which is basically z average is radius of gyration .	3.348826810909509

So , this is the final equation ; we called this RGD model in the name of Rayleigh , Debye and Guinier for a poly dispersed polymer coil in dilute solution and this is valid for scattering at low angle .	2.8308157408864187

Now , we have this equation .	9.29248509724435

Now , how to get more information with we can deduce from this .	3.7505255965356223

I want to plot zimm and see what are the information we can get from this .	5.241857527771315

K c by R theta is a function of both c and theta .	4.711814659164174

So , now , we can plot this as a combined function of c and theta .	4.198812723617467

So , for that what we need to do in the experiment , we first need to get the R solvent for a dust free solvent .	3.6997232975088274

First you get the Rayleigh ratio for only the pure solvent which must be completely dust free otherwise , the scattering from the dust molecules and which will give the enormous error in your measurements .	3.1654283776362204

Then you make few dilute solutions , polymer solutions of frequent concentrations and say c 1 c 2 c 3 and so on , and get R solution for all these concentrations .	2.890455979095243

Now , once we get R solution , we have the value for R solvent which will give us the value for delta R and if we measure different angles which will give us the value for delta R theta .	3.478266153426302

We know the value for optical constant K , because all the terms remember the refractive index of the solvent molecule we need to get the d and d c value for the polymer molecules ; specifically refractive index increment for the molecules ; and we know the lambda and so N A , and so on .	3.497879835735825

So , we know the value for K ; and we know the concentration term here now delta I R theta .	4.483821475272703

So , we know almost everything ; what we need to know to construct a zimm plot ?	3.1184827454532216

How do you construct a zimm plot ?	3.847178755809593

We plot K c by delta R theta as we said that this term is a function of both theta and concentration , we combine these two with a constant term this is arbitrarily chosen constant .	2.93761629585911

So , that we can free the data points or we can plot the data points well separated with each other .	3.6708110057361965

So , we now have the measurements done for all the solutions at different angles .	3.529540800172462

So , we now plot the data for example , to detect for concentration c 1 and plot the points at different angles theta 1 theta 2 and theta 3 ; for simplicity we are just maintaining or just taking three data points in practically it should be many more angles .	2.325133036977846

Similarly , we can do it for second concentration c 2 and get this value , get delta R theta excess Rayleigh ratio at different angles ; similarly , we get for the third solution .	3.078360471428066

So , here we are already showing for three concentration , but in practically there should be more concentration and we are only showing data for three angels .	2.9172975520379607

So , that is your theta 1 , this is theta 2 and this is theta 3 .	5.202765919472648

So , we have three solutions with 3 data for 3 angles ; so , 9 data points .	3.0987146662749097

Now , we extrapolate this data .	5.939952665466751

So , for a fixed theta we can extrapolate to c 1 equals to 0 , c is equal to zeros ; similarly , we can extrapolate theta 2 c is equal to 0 and theta 3 is equal to 0 , and also this value to theta is equal to 0 ; c 2 to theta is equal to 0 and this two again theta is equal to 0 .	3.098253910459285

So , this curve now is for theta is equals to 0 and this is for c equals to 0 .	4.176407891264861

So , this two points should match and this is the intercept K c by delta R theta as c is equal to 0 and theta equals to 0 .	3.505146449135726

Now , why we are doing this extrapolation ?	6.549596069526789

Why we extrapolate ?	13.347060338987925

This expression or scattering equations varied for very dilute solution , we ideally want the scattering intensity from one molecule .	2.9344876594063267

So , to avoid or to eliminate any intermolecular scattering effect for that we are extrapolating c is equal to 0 and we want also eliminate any intermolecular scattering effect .	2.7647395991153565

So , we want to extrapolate at 0 angle at 0 angle t theta will be 1 ; so , you can eliminate any intermolecular scattering effect and at c is equal to 0 , we can eliminate the intermolecular scattering effect all together .	2.5941827049469945

So , now we have plotted all this data we know this intercept and we can get the slopes for c is equal to 0 line , and for this theta is equal to 0 line .	3.796552010080869

So , if you go back and look at this expression and just plot c is equal to 0 lines and theta equals to 0 line , and see what are the information we can get .	3.4096922747106637

So , K c , the intercept ; c is equal to 0 and theta is equal to 0 should give you one ever weight average molecular .	3.507395988445348

So , this two intercept should match this line and this line in the same intercept .	3.914771683591958

So , that is one validation for data point and from the two straight lines one is c is equal to 0 straight line , another one is theta is equals to 0 straight lines .	2.8689072111644514

So , slopes for these two straight line will give other information .	3.5180350550154524

So , if you put c is equal to 0 you get this expression and this slope of this line will be given by this is the measure of slope .	4.679373261720588

So , if we know M w , we can get slope of c is equal to 0 ; we get the value for S square z , z average radius of gyration .	3.599098983854645

Similarly , if we write the equation for theta equals to 0 line , we get this and if we only dealing with very dilute solution , and if you ignore this higher terms .	3.5832299056279098

So , from the slope of theta equals to 0 line and making adjustment for K dash we can get A 2 from which we can get the values of polymer solvent interaction parameter .	3.6545853856790886

So , what are the things we can get ?	6.717969617713975

We can get M w from the intercepts or intercepts for c is equal to 0 and theta equal to 0 , and we can get z average radius of gyration which can be converted to weight average radius of gyration , and we can get information of A 2 which will anyway give information about the polymer solvent interaction parameter .	3.16802401541129

So , this was first practiced by Bruno Zimm .	3.611287065854619

So , this is known as zimm plot ; this is very unique way of plotting this three dimension 3 d data into two dimensional using the help of a arbitrarily chosen constant and we can get this information from this zimm plot .	2.798089741483327

Now , coming to the experimental points , what are the experimental consideration we must do for this light scattering experiment ?	3.446919341271697

One is the solvent and the solute solution all the polymer solution should be absolutely dust free ; otherwise , the dust particles will scatter light that will interfere and give error in the your final result .	2.7399533444973314

So , basically we do normally in the lab filter these 0.2 micron to say 0.545 micron filter to get rid of any dust or suspended particle is there .	2.3170727025707114

Second , we need to do a calibration the detector is typically a molecular tube ; the output of the detector is proportional to the light intensity .	3.476746601347615

So , we need to convert the voltage output to the intensity .	3.4744891194604524

For toluene , it has a very high Rayleigh ratio and we need to purify .	5.484452647940686

So , toluene has high R value Rayleigh ratio and pure form easily available .	2.771153190385822

So , we use to calibrate the detector with the toluene .	3.454423677651327

So , if we know we can basically get the information about light intensity from the voltage output .	3.525866901966321

Number three , if we are using more than one detector , we have to do normalization of the detectors ; we got the detectors may be of different sensitivity ; we define sensitivity and they are having different scattering ; if they are placed at different angle then their scattering volume may be different and the scattered light may also refract .	2.9460214975626413

So , for this reason we need to normalize the detector .	4.620571286189915

So , if you have several detector placed at different angles theta one , theta two , theta three and so on , we need to normalize the signal from this detector .	2.885507836941245

So , what we do ?	8.992565527992799

We take an isotropic scatterer and because we know isotropic scatterer the delta R theta is the angle independent .	3.3158889462072603

So , delta R for isotropic scatterer is angle independent .	3.7409819897708982

So , what we do is take an isotropic scatterer ; for example , say for organic solvent we can take a polystyrene about thirty K which is typically 5 nanometer ; for typically lasers this is less than lambda by 20 .	2.5848282670339646

So , for aqua solvent we can use BSA which is aqua solvent typically have 2 nanometer dimension radius is 2 nanometer ; so , this is also again an isotropic scatterer .	2.946080707756297

Fourth is we must do is accurately EPR solution .	4.049890508204541

So , that there is no error in the concentration values , because this is very important to know the concentration values and we need to get the accurate value d n by d c , and if this more important because the final expression have given by d c square term .	3.6664783067162428

So , if there is error here which gets multiplied more in the final value of determined by M w .	3.220240364973367

We also know that the P theta value or P theta expression which we just showed it is for Gaussian coil or random coil which typically polymers are in common solvent , but if you anticipate that your polymers are stiff rod like or a very hard sphere like then you need to use the different expression for P theta and there should not be any aggregate formation even though using a very dilute solution you should make sure that especially this is very important for proteins and the other bio moleculars that no aggregation takes place .	2.5443638656298346

T temperature of the solution must be fixed otherwise , you might get .	5.181252008205082

If you want to increase the sensitivity you can decrease the lambda , because the i theta is proportional to 1 over lambda 4 .	3.134108655114064

So , if you reduce the lambda then your sensitivity goes up ; the light scattering technique is not good for low molecular weights , because this i theta value for loads low molecular weights is very small , i theta is very small ; very difficult to detect and also d n by d c value for molecular is very low .	2.789985004005359

So , it is very difficult to accurately in the d n by d c value .	2.987892917752107

So , typically this technique is applied ; the lower limit is around the order of 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power 5 ; this is the lower limit and the upper limit is given by this lambda by 2 .	3.4049572476535874

Now , it is the lambda we are using , because what happened if the size of the scatterer or the polymer molecule or the other scatterer is very high and the respective interference between the scattered light from different part of the solute becomes so much that even at a little higher theta , this becomes 0 ; the value of P theta becomes 0 .	3.4676251793726087

So , i theta becomes 0 .	8.290383017785183

So , it is very difficult to get accurate measurements of i theta for those cases .	3.1113203986498195

In that case we need to get i theta value at very low theta to know or to find out accurate information .	3.3274508222005186

So , basically upper limit for determination is becomes lambda dash by 2 where lambda dash is the wavelength of the light in that particular medium .	2.6385526131834802

So , this is the conclusion or let us conclude the molecular weight determination by light scattering .	4.165711012036544

Now , as we said in the beginning , instead of light we can also use the small angle neutron scattering and small angle excess scattering get information about polymer solutions .	3.0971366936122013

The same theory applies as in case of light scattering ; the expression K is the optical constant is different , because the case r different for different cases ; because the source of origin of scattering .	2.9368897749551155

For light scattering , for LS , which difference in polarizibility of medium which causes the light to scatter .	2.643588973886699

So , K light scattering is proportional to d n by d c square ; whereas , for x - ray scattering , it is due to difference in the scattering is due to difference in electron density .	2.8365613665825125

So , K x scattering is proportional to the difference in the electron density and for neutron this is the scattering is due to neutron scattering length density .	3.591661574003444

So , KNS would be proportional to length density .	4.620061662319288

So , depending up on which what is the origin for scattering for different electromagnetic radiation whether it is a light scattering or x - ray or neutron scattering ; the optical constant will be dependent on the difference in polarizibility or electron density and so on .	3.171592165899763

Now , x - ray is very small in compared to a visible light which is having 400 nanometer to 800 nanometer , it is about only 0.1 nanometer whereas , the neutron is about 0.1 nanometer to 2 nanometer .	3.0129725131437874

So , remember the upper limit of the measurements where about lambda dash by 2 .	3.340816749716261

So , that was the upper limit .	7.406530712366119

So , for having any many useful information about this from this x - ray neutron scattering , the scatterer must be very small and what you need to do ?	3.1452662956372883

You need to place or you need to measurements at very low theta typically less than 2 degree .	3.8184937909525174

Now , if you want to get information or detect the scattering intensity at such low angle then you need to place your scatterer .	3.3372353952807354

If this is 0 degree then if you want to measure a 2 degree then you need to place your scatterer at very large distance having found the scattering particle .	3.256072985853545

So , basically you need huge equipments like which equipments where the distance between the scatterer or the sample cell and the detector is about say 1 meter to 40 meter range .	2.5269719309846903

So , this is typically that is the difficulty in this technique .	4.719422965325298

So , very specialized equipment ’ s are made .	4.393173661242709

SAKS is commonly used for measuring sizes of dispersed phases in polymers and also it is suitable for getting polymer morphology ; whereas , SANS is basically we got the information about the radius of gyration , it can be used in bulk medium or bulk amorphous polymer .	2.9070065921072192

So , with the help of sans it was observed that the radius of gyration in a bulk amorphous polymer is similar as in case of theta solvent ; so which was not possible to find out before the invention of this SANS technique ; SANS technique help us to get information ; both SANS and SAKS get information in solid sate or in amorphous bulk state from which will give us the information about the polymer chain the dimension in bulk state ; and if you compare the theta solvent , this is the first time after invention of SANS it was found that the dimension of polymer chains are similar in case of theta solvent and in amorphous bulk solution .	2.857131787616445

We just need to discuss that this techniques are quite good , but this light scattering techniques or the equipments are very costly .	2.5049961566172634

And one thing if you look at this scattering factor P theta versus scattering angle ; now , if you have some approximate about you know length of the molecular weight of your polymer then you know how this polymer or how the scattering factor P theta will vary with scattering angle .	3.15034147206811

For example , if you dealing with a 100 K polystyrene molecules which typically we deal in lab , then look that P theta does not increases much with scattering angle .	2.087037718526799

The scattering angle decreases much with a P theta ; the scattering factor decreases much with the scattering angle when you have a large molecule where dimension is larger .	3.0245763450820897

So , basically the polymers we deal in the lab sometimes we do not require detectors of so many angles may be one detectors at low angles could be sufficient for determination of the molecular weight .	2.915234613625675

Now , this is what we are discussing the static light scattering technique .	5.171741206054085

Now , in the beginning we said that we can also use the light scattering technique as dynamic light scattering which is also known as quasi elastic light scattering or sometime photo correlation spectroscopy .	3.260414923337229

So , here we detect the scattering from very small volume at very small time intervals ; this is what we do ; delta T which varies from microseconds to milliseconds and then correlate the scattering intensity fluctuations with time .	2.4318244459141414

Now , how this scattering intensity fluctuation for say polymer molecule in solutions can be either from this Brownian motion of the polymer molecules which gives translational diffusion and also could be due to the conformational changes of the polymer molecule .	3.2799406023406945

If this is the large molecule then conformation changes also may produce or the change the fluctuation in concentration which will give us the fluctuation in the scatter intensity .	2.9834562679118326

Now , from this correlation we can get the information about z average diffused translational without going not going too much in the equations , we can just say that this correlation give us the information or the value of z average translation diffusion coefficient .	2.717262514204702

So , the information about R h hydrodynamic radius of the polymer molecules in solution can be obtained .	4.6226272377247595

So , now , we discussed the various static light scattering techniques and we use of light scattering technique we can wet average molecular weight .	3.484258709872508

We can get also information about the polymer solvent interaction parameter and the radius of gyration , and with the help of dynamic light scattering we can get information about the hydrodynamic radius of the polymer molecules in a solvent for particular temperature .	3.5816048934508937

Now , let us move to the next topic which is gel permeation chromatography , GPC .	3.2311438342703442

Till now , we were discussing techniques which either can detect say viscosity average molecular weight or number average molecular weight , or the weight average molecular weight by themselves , but this methods were not enough to get the printed distribution of the polymer sample .	3.4222086897258035

Now , this technique gel permeation chromatography in short GPC allows the measurements of entire molar mass distribution which enables us all the molecular averages to be computed which was not possible with the other techniques and we can use the GPC as the imperative techniques which we can use polymer per run , and then we can fractionate polymers according to their molecular weight .	2.698571886893327

GPC is also called SEC size exclusion chromatography , because we will know now itself that the principle behind the separation of this polymer molecules is based on the exclusion of size .	3.31097784890858

Now , this is apparatus of GPC gel permeation chromatography of solvent reservoir which pump the solvent through the columns .	2.5669130525435113

Now , to have a steady flow , you might have a pulse dampener which gives the flow at a steady flow rate and you can have a filter which will filter the solvent .	3.166344327763043

So , that no dust particle goes in here you inject sample basically sample goes in the column you can have one or more columns connected in a series , and the polymer sample gets separated according to their size hydrodynamic volume in this columns , and when they come out you have a detector which detect the polymer molecules , and with the help of computer you can analyze this data .	2.7959806925921207

So , basically in feasible you inject the polymer samples in a column which is consist of highly cross linked gel beads ; the beads are typically having diameter of 5 microns to 10 microns and they have definite pore size which can start from say for 10 to the power 100 Armstrong or 50 Armstrong to 10 to the power 5 Armstrong .	2.3777896533693545

So , pore size might vary from very low to moderately high and they are packed with having beads of diameter of 5 micron to 10 micron .	2.5505057872054495

These beads are pores with a pore size varies between say 50 Armstrong in to 10 to the power 5 Armstrong .	2.8018393586900516

And the polymers gets separated in this column and then you can get detect the polymers using detectors concentration detectors like UV , IR or refractive index detector .	2.930082482579052

So , the principle is that you have pores in the column and the polymer molecules which are higher size they do not or cannot go inside this pores .	4.145129337035984

So , they come out fast and the polymers which have lower size they can go inside the pores which makes their path length which are longer compared to a higher sized polymer molecules ; and as a results they elute or come out column at a later time .	2.8397090883235117

So , basically if you put a mixture of different size polymer in this case only two size is shown here ; may be big and small molecule .	3.4329128852564765

So , it is not that all the pores are having same size , the pores size also have some distribution .	3.7877161053009827

So , with flow when this polymer mixture goes through the columns , the larger ones move faster ; as a result at the end of the column or end of the path , the larger ones come out earlier and you get the smaller ones come out later .	3.035725437295113

So , when the polymers come out you need to have a detectors which will detect and in most of the cases , because we want to get the concentration of the polymers which are coming out ; we usually use concentration detectors in GPC and most common use is refractive index detector ; and also in some cases we also UV visible spectrometer which basically is the polymer has some groups which absorb in visible region then we can get the concentration of polymer in that solution by UV visible spectroscopy .	3.2665919244923867

Recently , evaporative mass is detector is getting popularity where the polymer solutions are evaporated and the scattering from the polymer globules are measured ; and we can also interrogative spectrometer , but it is not very common .	3.1607955337506186

So , what we get ?	8.368979876955999

At the end of GPC experiment , we get a detector response and with the illusion volume .	3.9530458640211754

So , the higher molecular weight or hydrodynamic size polymers will come out faster with lower illusion volume and the lower ones will come out later .	3.2548449357468296

So , we get a detector response like this .	4.916848679827789

Now , what you need to covert this raw signal to typically how we represents a polymer distribution ?	2.8842616476682403

So , we need to convert this to this type of expression .	5.18710331735402

So , that we can get a curve like this and we can get M n , M w and the other M z and so on from this curve .	4.821133904567662

We cannot get the value of M w , M n and other average molecular weights from this raw graph .	3.9811668111174456

So , what we need to do ?	5.97461184340737

We need to convert this editor response to weight fraction of the polymer molecules and we need to convert the illusion volume to the polymer molecule weight .	4.241482814223713

So , let us stop here ; what we will do in the next lecture is to start from this curve and first we will know how to convert this detector response to weight fraction of the polymers and illusion volume to molecular weight , and then discuss about the different aspect of gel permeation chromatography , calibration and other experimental related things .	3.0848409824780387

So , let us stop here and we will continue our discussion on gel permeation chromatography GPC or size exclusion chromatography in next lecture .	3.0412558791342605

In our previous lecture , we had discussed some issues regarding the enzyme science particularly the sciences that are associated with the study of enzymes , the nomenclature of enzymes and key issues that relate to the importance of enzymes in the over all perspective of biotechnology .	2.4774784955731084

Today we will be discussing some of the characteristic features of enzymes particularly as proteins and their chemical nature .	3.6555330351915747

All of you may be aware that all the enzymes that are known so far are proteins in chemical nature .	3.655469065978057

When I say proteins we immediately understand a chain of amino acids .	3.360799370985703

Twenty different amino acids that are linked through peptide bonds and the size of the chain may extend some where from 100 amino acids to 300 amino acids in different enzymes .	3.0241684095515677

They are macromolecules of different amino acids in a sense they are hetero macromolecules , hetero polymers ; that means the monomer units are not identical in nature .	3.077976268045471

They vary among the twenty different amino acids and their sequence and the number of amino acids or the relative concentration of each of the amino acid may determine the particular type of enzymes , its characteristic properties as well as its functional aspects .	3.253270800855247

As a macromolecule , we will notice that the properties of a macromolecule will largely depend upon the constituent monomers .	4.0592419114372955

In the case of amino acids , they vary in terms of their various properties particularly ionic nature , their hydrophobic nature and their size .	2.832198893782501

There is large variation and therefore the relative proportion of these amino acids also influence the properties of the consequent macromolecule what we know as proteins .	3.1343575971804745

Besides a macromolecule of various combinations of amino acids , the enzymes may also be considered as a catalyst .	4.287346759855336

Only those proteins which have catalytic function , that means they can accelerate the rate of a particular reaction , can be termed as enzymes .	4.235028399686853

Proteins as you all may be aware have diverse functions in a living cell like structure , transport molecules , example - haemoglobin or myoglobin , defense molecules like antibodies and the fact remains that their more significant function in a living cell is catalytic .	2.162562700832795

Enzymes therefore can be termed as active proteins which have catalytic function in a living cell .	2.9518152215108793

Alternatively some of the protein molecules which are known to be enzymes but may not be intrinsically catalytically active may require the role of an associated molecule what we term as cofactor for them to be catalytically active .	3.0627902251365646

That means the protein molecule itself is not catalytically functional but in the presence of the cofactor the molecule may become a catalyst and may be considered as an enzyme .	3.5522968413285194

These cofactors again could range from a small molecular weight organic molecule .	3.8324707434715917

This may be required to be externally added like for example NAD , ATP , FAD or a variety of cofactor that you are familiar with in many of the bio chemical reactions or they could be or they could be as simple as metal ions and the fact that because in the absence of these cofactors the protein is not catalytically active , it implies that these cofactors have a very significant role in the catalytic mechanism which these molecules display .	2.9464442251715552

Also these proteins may be very simple proteins for example a simple amino acid polymeric chain .	3.3273255230340113

They could also be conjugated proteins .	6.336466276671192

By conjugated proteins we mean in addition to the amino acids the proteins chain will also be associated with some other non - amino acid molecules .	3.066786862294378

Very commonly encountered proteins are glycoproteins , many of the enzymes , particularly those which are isolated from eukaryotes , a glycoproteins which means that in addition to the amino acids the protein molecule is associated with an oligosaccharide , monosaccharide or an oligosaccharide , they could lipo proteins a lipid molecule , they could be nucleoproteins and a large number of proteins which are metalloproteins containing metal enzymes where the metal ions acts as a cofactor are known .	2.4328886646136425

Another characteristic feature of these proteins as a constituent or as a chemical body of the enzyme is that in many cases there may be single chain of amino acids , a single chain protein and many of the industrial enzymes particularly hydrolytic enzymes are single chains which means that the backbone of the protein consists of only one polymeric chain and in many cases they could be even multimeric proteins that means more than one chain constitute the whole enzyme molecule .	3.163172593207935

A single chain is not functionally active .	5.122281744372004

The arrangement or the organization of the multiple chains could be two chains ; there could be three chains or four chains .	2.983035456548745

The organization of those chains provides certain natures which are responsible for the catalytic function and these multimeric chains or the multimeric proteins as some of you are familiar have a distinct role in regulatory aspect of the cellular metabolism .	2.3225584390780916

As I was talking about the synthesis of the macromolecule the basic backbone of the protein chain in the case of a protein lies in the condensation of two different amino acids .	4.065557578189031

Here R1 and R2 indicate the distinction between two amino acids and the carboxylic group of one and amino group of other amino acid condense and form a - CONH bond which is known as peptide bond .	3.310254095938871

These peptide bonds have a resonance structure .	4.572198849180473

It has a very peculiar property which is really carried forward in the function and structure of the enzyme molecules .	3.8015742402934483

This is the resonance structure and also the peptide units are rigid and planar in nature and the most important property which contributes to its secondary structure is the capability of free rotation about the alpha carbon and nitrogen and alpha carbon and carbon .	2.603025436310409

At these two sites they can freely rotate .	4.561026077539236

The bond can freely rotate and thereby can give rise to hydrogen bonding between the different amino acid residues in the chain and constitute the subsequent structural organization of the macromolecule .	3.1491808782905655

When we look at quantification of an enzyme molecule or enzyme sample or what we know as assay methods they also take into account these two major characteristics .	3.066629454327694

The quantification methods could be classified into two categories mainly or the two constituents could form the basis of assay methods .	2.773718798108464

One is based on the protein concentration that means an enzyme sample can be quantified on the basis of a protein sample .	4.156635626689474

That means what is the concentration of protein in a given sample and in terms of say milligram per liter .	4.369204099399006

One could determine by any method that is known to us and I will talk about it a little later .	3.6486372006986683

The other way could be and which is probably more important for assay of an enzyme is its catalytic function .	3.6735120574616413

That means you assay it or you determine its capability to carry out a biochemical reaction and represent its concentration in the form of initial reaction rate .	3.2763982278789396

Any catalyst or any chemical reaction if you look at the reaction profile it can be indicated as between time and product formed and ultimately the rate of the reaction at duration dp / dt at the zero time will give you the initial reaction rate .	3.7270966707341047

This initial reaction rate is considered one of the parameters for determining the concentration of any enzyme sample .	6.110012311006349

As a convention the quantity of enzyme which converts one micro mole of substrate into product per minute is termed as the rate .	3.006761159717022

Quantity of enzyme which can exhibit this kind of a rate , initial rate is termed as one international unit .	3.6680306369845566

That is the conventional , internationally accepted unit of an enzyme activity .	4.525323781015892

One international unit of enzyme is the quantity of that enzyme or the concentration of that enzyme which can convert one micro mole of substrate into product in unit time per minute .	3.620292786831949

One macro mole of product formed per minute of the reaction can be considered as one international unit .	4.280370424719483

One of the limitations is that this is not a SI unit which is an internationally accepted system of units .	4.134254609321137

In the case of enzyme activity the SI unit is katal .	4.219105102669764

If we look into basic units of the international SI system , a katal in terms of rate terms will be the quantity of enzyme that produce one mole of product per second .	3.0176048465692418

One mole of product per second is a very large unit .	5.517129916164033

If you make a comparison between the international unit and katal , katal is a very large unit and one katal could correspond to 106 x 60 international units because convert moles into macro moles and minutes into seconds .	2.3048548331461163

A unit of katal is much larger and one can interconvert .	4.472519434571503

The initial reaction rate is the basic philosophy in determining the enzyme concentration .	4.856089136425073

On the other hand the protein concentration also gives us an idea of the amount of an enzyme present in a given sample .	4.024463212417782

Although it may not always be true if the protein is not in its functional form , it will loose its status of the enzyme .	2.915612801799537

It may remain as the protein .	5.5069725024916

But the importance of the protein concentration lies in the fact that it gives you an idea about the purity of the sample .	4.654298089481879

In case of mixture of proteins you can identify what proportion of the total protein is the enzyme molecule or what proportion of the total protein is the catalytically functional enzyme molecule and therefore protein concentration determination is important .	2.816865783755653

Whenever we analyze any given enzyme sample , we usually resort to both the basis : its initial reaction rate as well as protein concentration .	3.1780183953656826

A large number of methods are used to determine protein concentration , as you may be familiar with , and all of them are linked or based on the native structure of protein , the constituent amino acids of a protein .	3.1196783127884076

The most simple system probably you are familiar is by ultra violent absorption .	3.1254330363026086

We determine the absorbance at 280 which gives you very precise information about the concentration of protein in the sample and this absorbance is based on the content of amino acid residues tyrosine and tryptophan in the protein which are more or less universally present in most of the enzyme samples .	3.5646113273684605

One of the major limitations of this method is that it will have the interference or some kind of error involved if the impurities contain molecules that also absorb near this wave length .	2.8580631584833993

Major contaminant in biological samples are nucleic acids which also have absorbance at about 260 nm and therefore sometime how to make an account of protein concentration taking in view the absorbance as a result of nucleic acid and very often the ?	2.3933867764762504

280 - ?	81.5832344388429

260 with some appropriate factors are used to determine the absolute protein concentration in a given sample .	3.463338631476504

Another method which is very popular is Loury ’ s method which is based on the production of a blue purple color which absorbs maximum at 660nm with a sodium tungstate molybdenum phosphate reagent what we call as fallacy of call to the reagent which is usually a standard which is available and reagent is very accurate in the sense that you can monitor the protein concentration as low as ten milligram per litre .	2.499678485589883

A very accurate method which also has many other merits is in terms of lack of interference .	3.5581196710972005

Another method is biuret method which is based on the reduction with alkaline Copper sulphate solution which contains sodium potassium tartrate and the cupric ions form a co - ordination complex with the amino groups or the - NH group present in the peptide bond .	2.561879409309581

The basic advantage here is that the method is based on the peptide bond which is very unique as far as the proteins are concerned .	4.609126363025451

The other polymers or other molecules present as contaminant will not contribute to error in the case of a biuret method .	3.343791035551754

Biuret method is based on the development of a blue color with an alkaline copper sulphate solution containing sodium potassium tartrate .	2.8298652856925943

This cupric ions after reduction forms a co - ordination complex with the –NH group present in the peptide bond .	3.1159102990761394

The specificity of this method is based on co - ordination complex formation with the peptide bond which is a unique property or a basic property in all proteins .	3.204770831555422

Unlike in the case of other methods which are based on tyrosine or tryptophan as residues , the relative concentration of these amino acids in the protein will give you a different reading .	3.6903731804911706

But biuret reagent will give you a very uniform method in case of all proteins .	5.111523042144912

You have other methods which are based on dye binding or silver binding method where the protein can bind certain molecules and the binding is assayed quantitatively and expressed in terms of protein content .	2.823480278263868

But all these methods have a unique linkage or they have been standardized right from beginning in a more basic fundamental method what we know as Kjeldhal method .	2.767946224755433

The basis of Kjeldhal method is primarily estimation of nitrogen content .	3.1313108019794362

Just like peptide bond , the nitrogen content is also intrinsic component of any protein .	2.8188627515988434

You digest the protein sample with concentrated sulphuric acid in the presence of a catalyst .	3.3956755907271488

Ammonia is produced and the ammonia then is absorbed into dilute acid solution which is titrated and the quantity of amino generated can be calculated .	2.765929118249027

There are minor modification in terms of automation and macronization of these methods which are available today commercially but the basis is to determine the nitrogen content in any given sample which gives you an estimate of crude protein in the sample .	2.9152974175607125

It is assumed that any given protein contains approximately 16 % of nitrogen .	3.4282241066357617

So if you multiply nitrogen content by 6.8 you get the net protein .	4.165650944507501

But it will be called crude protein in the sense that it will also measure all those molecules which contains nitrogen in addition to proteins .	3.5562058885370633

But still it is one of the earliest methods that we had known and had been used .	4.339301918873044

So a very important aspect is assay which you should be very clear .	4.814289613255875

Another point which I like to highlight here before I proceed further is about the SI .	3.2009978229468525

The best way to ensure such clarity is that instead of taking one sample we take at least two or three dilutions of the same sample which are let us say two fold , four fold , six fold , known dilutions and the final reaction rate which has been obtained must be proportional to the dilution .	2.6766771246847787

Unless you get two different samples in the same linear range you cannot depend on the result because if you take a higher concentration of the enzyme you may be able to measure this reaction rate which is much lower than you would have got in a diluted sample .	3.7448403625336697

One of the conventional ways is that we try to ensure that the reaction rate measured in the low dilution region or low concentration region can be easily measured by taking more than two samples of known dilution.The next important property of proteins is their ionic behavior .	2.633357995559651

This ionic behavior results from the monomer units that are present in the amino acid which are present in the macro molecule and when we consider a long protein chain bulk of the amino groups and the carboxylic groups in the amino chain will be involved in the formation of peptide bond .	3.813817944002416

It will be only the residual amino acids and the two ends one will have a carboxylic group and other will have an amino group free and both these groups will be free to ionize at any given pH .	2.9594723268018

Having both positive and negative group at the end will ensure that at any given pH the molecule will have some charge .	3.79337556072773

If you look at a very general system where I am assuming that all the R ’ s that are mentioned here are non - ionisable .	3.030539509707502

So we have only two groups with net positive charge .	4.021910234959681

At a low pH the molecule will act like a cation and as we increase the pH it will be negatively charged and it will behave like anion and some where in between there will be a zero net charge that means it will have both positive and negative charge of equal magnitude , what we call as zwitterion in the case of amino acids .	3.168718756187588

That will entirely depend on the pka value of the two charges .	4.961488706461402

It will not be at pH 7 .	7.96081359898292

It will depend upon the pka value of the two .	6.547326421794369

That means the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant of the two charges .	4.421741038248989

The situation is a simplified situation where we are assuming that only two terminal amino acids are ionized .	3.717703541735229

It will always happen that it will have residues like for an example these R ’ s which are also ionisable and the system might become a little more complex .	2.8771343278429193

For example consider a protein chain in which you have amino acid like aspartic acid .	3.385546809048373

It has two carboxylic groups instead of only an amino group .	3.5743377745493095

It has an additional carboxylic group .	5.645818915229081

At low pH , again similarly here it will have only one net positive charge , amino group will be ionized .	3.5451935782176287

As we move further , increase the pH it will have one carboxylic and one amino group ionized .	3.4118126815988434

When the pH is increased to a level where both the negative ions are ionized and the amino group is not ionized and ultimately you will also meet here a situation where you have zwitterions where one amino group and one carboxylic group are ionized , the other carboxylic group is non - ionized and that is a status .	2.758483259286905

This carboxylic group may be different than your amino group or the carboxylic group known .	3.7971900382286368

A similar situation will be in the case of lysine for example when you have more than one basic amino group .	4.846698437074172

Some of the ionisable groups found in proteins are not only aspartic acid and lysine or glutamic acid that contribute to the ionization state of a protein .	2.8161707524309336

There are other amino acids particularly like histidine or cystine or tyrosine .	2.9018114518513216

They also play a role in ionization and they also have ionization behavior and their approximate pKa values are indicated here .	2.819662655165962

The net charge in the protein will depend on ionization state at a given pH of all the contributing proteins in the system .	3.757712277661715

That is a very important property which we must keep in mind when we look at enzymes for a variety of functions .	3.9983177594753854

Whether it is a catalytic function , whether it is a purification of enzyme protein the ionic behavior plays a very key role .	3.8445476114225925

That will depend entirely on pH .	5.112631602609845

For example you look at let us see the approximate pKa values .	4.600166797177703

For the C - terminal alpha carboxylic group the pKa is three and for the aspartic acid beta carboxylic group , the pKa is 3.9 .	2.602691211690048

It is because it is linked to another carbonate which is not in the basic chain .	4.599101755308708

The pKa is different and ionization will totally depend on the pKa value of the functional group .	4.235173285169435

Usually yes but it cannot be cited as a rule .	3.956213935101689

The nature of amino acid has a very important role to play in the conformation .	4.497951468743739

In the case of proteins the beauty lies in that it is a very highly folded molecule .	4.101412849339969

That means its volume is very much conserved .	4.552370590337233

The molecule is very compact .	6.529202673143231

It is not extended like a rod .	4.455211743958571

Not that there are no proteins which are not in the extended form .	6.151230182818425

Many of the structural proteins will be in the extended form but most of the proteins which constitute enzymes are globular proteins and they form almost a spherical shape under ideal condition .	2.823112689148203

But usually they will be in the ellipsoid kind of the situation where you can determine the conformation by their minor and major axis .	4.040855261629025

In fact there are relationships available where many of the hydrodynamic and transport properties of these polymers solutions can be related to the major and minor axis of the ellipsoid particle and these are broadly the methods which are used in general to determine the dimensions of the protein molecule or the nature of conformation , if suppose we know about the native conformation , we know the dimensions and after certain treatment if the dimensions are altered we tend to understand that they have under gone a conformational change .	2.6221408800381747

These conformations are the result of the nature of the amino acids , the side chains of the amino acids , the principle functional group .	3.924491117614124

The principle interactions that are present in the case of any given protein or that applies to an enzyme are peptide bonds .	4.1275915615096075

They form the backbone of the total protein chain but the conformation is a result of a number of non covalent interactions .	4.128696964628607

Individually they may not be very strong in terms of bond energy but collectively in terms of number of bonds present they provide a very stable structure to a molecule .	3.7889925162128106

The hydrogen bonds are attractive forces between a hydrogen atom attached to an electro negative atom .	2.6762139696371507

That means the electro negative oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is attached to the hydrogen of - NH group .	2.631053881148482

This kind of a bond particularly between different peptide bonds can create a hydrogen bond and a large number of these bonds are present in any given molecule .	3.2043335600569547

The next important interaction , non - covalent interaction is electrostatic force .	3.4476575297474983

I mentioned that the molecule will consist of a number of ionisable amino acid residues and these ionisable amino acid residues might have molecules at a distance having positive and negative charges and when they interact they might exhibit the an electro static interactions and provide stability to the molecule .	2.82805673343411

Hydrophobic forces are very often considered to be a major force which is involved in the globular structure .	4.148453145048821

That means when you consider the wet side , on the surface there will be most of the charged groups and most of the non polar side chains will be located inside the three dimensional molecules .	3.8198289177146765

It doesn ’ t mean that on the surface there are no hydro phobic patches .	4.133525765889972

Most enzymes will have certain hydrophobic patches on the surface which are required for many functional purposes because many of the interfacial actions will involve the hydrophobic patches on the surface and have an important role on the functional aspect .	2.9636132332496885

Another covalent bond , disulphide bonds which have an importance in the case of stability of these conformation are the oxidation of cystein residues .	3.039228402391422

Two cystein residues oxidize to give S - S bond and that can come at different points in the chain .	3.0551179326644196

After the folding is over , two cystein residues can join together to form a sulphydryl and thereby provide a stability to the conformation .	2.565732154409135

The conformation resulting from the forces of these interactions that take place are usually classified into four categories .	2.6466795315980765

The simplest and the primary structure is the sequence and the content of different amino acids present in an enzyme sample .	3.565769680479653

Both the content and the sequence will vary from enzyme to enzyme .	3.294729730728783

Then this chain can fold itself locally in the shape of either an alpha helix or a pleated sheet so as to give a secondary structure .	3.040077291678425

If you look at secondary structure in the form of a right handed alpha helix , the helix moves upwards and basically their structure results from the formation of hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds .	2.580500876526759

A hydrogen bond is formed between the - NH group and the - C0 group in the chain at a distance by four amino acid residues .	3.8187724881284986

That means the folding of the polypeptide chain into an alpha helix results with hydrogen bonding between the –NH and - CO residues located at the distance and this interaction results in a very smooth and regular dimensions of the chain in the case of alpha helix .	2.695721773938248

That mean the distances between these two turns is about 0.54 nm per turn 3.6 amino acid residues going to 0.5 and these dimensions have been extended over a large number of proteins and are found to be uniform .	2.6330400978426707

When the protein molecule gets folded into a secondary structure of alpha helix , the side chains of the amino acids are projected outwards like a rotatory form .	2.7556821850604147

The side chains are also free to interact with each other and provide you electrostatic interactions and other features .	3.2641633129503

This alpha helix and other type of conformation which many proteins will have will be again as the result of hydrogen bonding will be in the form of beta pleated sheet .	2.9788837667359087

They can be parallel or anti parallel .	4.426359706187682

The hydrogen bonding between two sections of the polypeptide chain can form beta pleated sheet and because the poly peptide chain has polarity , either parallel or anti parallel , beta sheet can be formed and you come across in any given protein sample the alpha helix as well as beta pleated sheet structures very commonly .	2.441710097177125

After these secondary structures are formed again the molecule as the result of Vander waal forces and electrostatic interactions force into a compact globular molecule .	2.3500817525396047

In the top figure different shapes indicate different amino acids and the linear chain of that is termed as primary structure .	3.098441181729721

The folding of these polypeptide chains into alpha helix or the alternative could be the beta pleated sheets , the secondary structure .	2.6568449635966807

This structure again folds itself into a globular form as a result of disulphide bridges .	3.3472508929193294

In electro static interactions also hydrogen bonding and Vander Waal interactions forces into a globular mass and the basis of that ultimately leads to minimum energy level because at the minimum energy level it will be stable .	2.653010634154535

Any deviation from the minimum energy level will lead to its denaturation or inactivation of the catalytic function of the enzyme sample .	4.07376805965355

When I use the term denaturation , the term denaturation does not in any sway consider the break down of the covalent bonds .	2.857600432250974

That is the basic backbone of the peptide bond .	4.8168051066871085

The disruption of the non covalent interaction is good enough to lead to denaturation .	3.397116225725822

In a destructive way you can also break the peptide bond but then you will be destroying the protein itself .	4.023084639926495

But the destruction of or disruption of non - covalent bonds , non - covalent interactions will retain the protein molecule but we lose only the catalytic activity , catalytic function and that is what is the usual meaning of denaturation .	3.041824099342417

The globular form of the folded protein is termed tertiary structure .	4.130280486509732

Many proteins may be oligomeric proteins that means they may consist of more than one chain and the arrangement of these chains into a particular fashion so that they are able to bring about certain catalytically active sites is called quaternary structure .	3.0292745210877716

The quaternary structure is only applicable if the enzyme protein consists of more than one chain .	4.650984938821955

In case of a single chain enzyme the quaternary structure question doesn ’ t arise but possible in the case of a multimeric enzyme or what we call as oligomeric enzyme .	3.1252363837166564

The quaternary structure could be a dimmer , it could be trimer , it could be a tetramer depending on the number of chains present and the organization will really lead to the final conformation .	3.747320675089425

I was talking about the formation of sulphydryl bridge .	6.102220333078313

The two cysteine molecules can undergo oxidation to give you cystine molecule which acts as bridges and these bridges is very strong contributor to the stability of the protein molecule in its tertiary structure .	2.6205882171055714

Whenever we look into any method particularly the protein engineering methods we tend to increase the number of sulphydryl bridges .	4.058662773522624

Because ultimately if we can have more sulphydryl bridges , it is likely to result into higher stability or in other words most of the enzyme samples which are obtained from thermophiles that means the organisms that can survive in the extreme temperatures will contain higher content of sulphydryl bridges and they are probably the features that results into the higher stability .	2.720393225605182

The other issue a very general issue about the feature of enzymes and proteins is the bio synthesis and regulation .	2.932242285136056

The biosynthesis of enzymes in any living system is exactly the same as biosynthesis of any protein .	3.4633224415749346

The central dogma of molecular biology covers the biosynthesis of enzymes and proteins .	3.545142785965457

The enzyme in many cases , particularly the oligomeric enzymes have to undergo some modification .	3.8477223088502464

There are certain organizational changes that lead to enzymatic protein or enzymatic constituent but otherwise the synthesis of the protein that leads to enzyme synthesis is identical .	2.4436859148489014

The whole set of information about the synthesis of a protein is coded in the DNA molecule .	3.379797106206855

That means the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA determines the amino acid composition of a protein and that particular portion of DNA gets replicated , transcripted to mRNA and other forms of RNA and then translation of ribosomes to protein .	2.2164025986244376

These are the steps for protein synthesis and in case of enzyme synthesis also the same principle applies .	3.7763469468618145

Most of the hydrolytic enzymes are regulated by the mechanisms commonly known as induction or repression or catabolic repression .	2.7161612012872

That means the structural gene of the particular protein is bound to a repressor molecule and unless an inducer is added it cannot be relieved .	2.6427579095484397

Most of the inducers for many enzymes very often are the substrate molecules themselves .	2.8560270890600297

There are a lot of structural similarities with xylose and glucose .	3.4928154788257584

Xylose is the inducer .	8.672422521349938

In the case of cellulase for example the cellulose act as an inducer and for many of the hydrolytic enzymes which are regulated by induction the substrate itself act as an inducer .	3.0577107310287355

Then they also undergo catabolic repression that means the availability of an easily assimilable carbon source and the most easily assimilable is glucose represses the synthesis of the enzyme .	2.903794339475517

Various other mechanism of ……… and all that will also a play a role in the regulation of the enzyme synthesis .	4.135742608675273

Another important feature of a regulation here besides biosynthesis , is regulation of the enzyme activity itself .	3.7082786914343107

Most of the enzymes are known to have a mechanism by which even their activity can be regulated not only at the biosynthesis level but at the functional level .	3.365560979102031

That means there are inhibitors and activator molecule which we normally know as effector molecules which can influence the initial reaction rate of the enzyme in the …… .	3.448372057697886

If you add along with the enzyme sample a known inhibitor molecule the reaction rate which is obtained will be much lower .	4.786688303691331

Similarly an activator molecule will increase the reaction rate and that is a very common feature of the regulation of enzyme activity and which is of significance even for commercial applications .	4.787291174283631

Another property of the enzymes in terms of proteins is their solubility .	7.134908032836641

All the globular proteins are known to be soluble in aqueous medium and so are the enzymes .	3.8000321204651044

Usually the solubility can be influenced by salt concentration that means ionic strength , the pH , the organic content in the solvent that means addition of a polymer , an organic polymer can affect the solubility and temperature is a universal parameter which influences solubility .	2.761079808113235

But you will notice that at least the first three parameters are very commonly used parameters for even isolation of an enzyme sample from a crude protein sample .	3.3378393739553327

Finally to conclude I would like to say that today we have discussed the characteristic features of enzymes that are attributed by proteins nature , as a macromolecule in terms of assay method , their ionic behavior , their conformation , solubility and the role these properties play in the various techniques that are used for isolation , purification or application of these enzymes .	2.5847162039344243

Quaternary structure has relevance in the case of oligomeric proteins that means the proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain .	3.804907759911454

The arrangement of these polypeptide chains into a particular formation can result in certain interaction which can form catalytic sites .	2.6232506800534097

The arrangement of different polypeptide chains in an oligomeric protein is termed as quaternary .	3.106884470757997

In fact each chain will have its known tertiary structure and then these globular structures will assemble in a format .	2.4786548461115627

Example is lactate dehydrogenase which is a tetramer consisting of four polypeptide chains .	3.932557661901574

Slight shift in these individual units can totally change the functional behavior of the enzyme .	3.3373685970360287

This has led to one of the diagnostic method particularly for the patients who are suffering from cardiac problems the lactate dehydrogenase from the heart muscles undergo the quaternary structural change .	2.305274247547459

And the change in quaternary structure is related to the disease behavior .	4.6068397892119695

That is one of the diagnostic tools .	6.180490322747024

So in fact even the conformational aspects are important for the applications .	3.513189930050325

4.314931352833273

Chicken pox varicella.	13.56802007681424

Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster VZV.	2.881464976774198

Fever and eruption of a special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox.	3.7240116198975657

A virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops.	3.452300177609014

It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox.	2.9666698765558954

It can also spread through a direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds.	3.0046329692955243

In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby.	3.3921777441279803

Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i.e.till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started.	2.3908902960198284

Fever , shivering , nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms , eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles.	2.8048079706151494

Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes.	3.8489282950371146

Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this.	3.529605456239715

Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion.	2.903702795122509

Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle.	3.2181301424428987

The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests.	2.5150771772105815

Every disease occurs due to a type of virus.	8.260499602736608

Virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope.	4.768630989812782

If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person.	4.357663180414856

HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs.	4.109996168237475

The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted.	3.4521170550811506

The results of infection are different and unexpected.	3.904669684207233

The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system.	4.498631214424359

Hepatitis-B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV.	3.283272966682778

In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis-B victimises more people to death in the whole year.	3.4932351240109547

Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis-B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included.	2.8075921803472568

HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person.	3.0479366081423187

The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis-B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination.	2.4134188840845177

With extensive use of hepatitis-B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis-B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis-B.	2.7346047523172397

What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again ?.	3.9308148902290347

The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence.	3.218471475232158

The family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of 1952.	3.425402308316189

On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo Egypt in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare.	2.173162403868028

All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services.	3.511692511831905

Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born.	3.1913680684503283

Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India.	3.7876277803333793

This program has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state.	3.490766961728878

Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh.	3.31699325982112

Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951-1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976-1981 and during the years of 1994-2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only.	2.386708363745934

Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar.	3.1391288854892045

Gross reproduction rate the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971-76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3.3.	2.8924484959009304

Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period.	3.3375849165865112

Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas.	2.8370038320515163

It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state.	3.197394904308356

Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas.	3.2011097217664224

A little less than half of the mothers 46 percent give birth to more than 3 kids.	3.6643488852669814

About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger.	4.527074004603438

It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular.	2.3049055472178694

According to the estimates of Sample Registration System S.R.S.the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9.	2.4937444930134527

The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate 68.	3.9986640028342078

Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births.	3.807069134531282

Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available.	5.514232840265265

Non-communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization.	2.955887940381227

The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate.	2.5668769666412166

The name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae.	4.59326524240804

Leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally.	4.116304747031646

The M.D.T.medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society.	2.5322804054052828

All the leprosy patients are not contagious.	5.710632042139151

Most of the patients are non-contagious who can not spread the disease , only 15 to 20 percent patients are contagious.	3.4867916866344117

Leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles , T.B.etc.	2.779099175076336

About 95 percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease can not happen to them.	3.5629387235868126

Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb.	3.960655708556784

If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication.	3.7387493397043183

If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing.	2.798994072745795

Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly.	3.3662231850240603

Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage.	3.793702692289722

Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients.	3.0412348851590503

Complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment can not be brought back to the previous state through medicines.	2.7782070528809086

Yes , the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such a way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood.	3.4380413244906403

The disease of measles can take a very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than 10 percent.	3.782177573532935

Therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible.	3.249269180531901

Besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination , considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the World Health Organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months.	2.994505531618607

Among the indications and symptoms of measles are included - fever , common symptoms of cold , conjunctivitis , cough , stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin.	2.4056267803022244

In comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents , its incubation period is about 10-12 days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period.	2.651761794985132

During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well.	2.977293147100506

The period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease.	3.818370272495824

Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining.	2.8070135364273017

Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth.	3.968793010805125

Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps.	4.197919385523216

Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths.	3.2419411619783336

Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while.	3.5435627818862034

The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules.The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children.	2.823333999696228

About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly.	2.725392613625979

When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened.	2.4838078232110306

Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR.	3.4647218877944144

MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine.	3.0570483920115574

The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective.	3.668119180367816

Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life.	2.886658714609436

Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy.	3.9682614735721002

However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme.	3.038226410121397

The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles.	3.334327520317949

Therefore now it is recommended by both W.H.O.and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles.	2.4280123313795205

Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel.	4.342168711266017

Such a system of brain is called mental disorder.	4.81122306319714

It is estimated that 1-2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease.	3.3884440993846403

It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill.	3.6719733029828383

Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality.	2.2951068091107985

Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease.	4.632259359495693

Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries.	3.255529414677695

It is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up.	3.1486350254964046

Not paying attention to any work.	7.704874780807953

Emergence of desire to take tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , marijuana.	4.308465929843028

Problem in desire or the process of copulation.	5.7511159345068705

Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him can be seen and then his physical and mental test is done.	2.4762602809642855

If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done.	2.080032296701855

Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods.	6.285299764923316

Listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health.	3.9988524866842488

Under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme above 19 year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of Rs.500 on first live delivery for proper nutrition.	2.037524221912511

The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows.	2.394366029951609

The following programs are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services.	2.860379621323553

A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre-delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level.	3.3607487197823476

The percentage of the women getting the pre-delivery test done thrice is only 18.	3.8947698692450925

There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre-delivery services in the urban and the rural areas.	2.614930319224556

More than three fourth of the women 78 percent in the urban areas gets the pre-delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so.	2.981734445245267

A little more than one third 39 percent of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills.	3.7949115527129185

In cases of tetanus toxide injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T.T., however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent.	3.0047218581074904

Generally there is much less vogue of pre-delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service -.	2.528816081871842

Indicating pregnant women.	15.77693734946137

Distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases.	3.1051919931436247

There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand.	3.92211974598746

This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives.	3.0415285726545784

Even in urban areas more than half 56 percent of childbirths takes place at home.	3.5679191230160416

In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives.	2.695304220812945

Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth 14 percent is benefitted with post-labour tests within two months.	2.209333825173529

Safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the post-childbirth services.	2.9040751987360465

Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin-A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion.	2.308127159683635

A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001-2002 , 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 has been shown in the following table.	2.840600257642788

The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans.	3.616255522687088

This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person.	3.7969061522747327

However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth.	5.352504951169577

Polio disease particularly attacks young children.	5.350300821784266

80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age.	4.203597537619145

Polio is an extremely contagious disease.	8.22510529790752

Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities.	2.6271844674996574

Oral Poliovirus Vaccine OPV was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union.	3.6657308503959336

As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries.	2.4596643066817285

The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world.	2.3412620261577053

The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful.	3.1513106816408136

Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help.	2.3242102023505535

By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis.	2.760572346453491

Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose.	4.07669054353284

Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less.	2.8861762307433008

Sex related diseases are contagious diseases.This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one 's sex partner during sexual intercourse.	2.705982426609278

This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy.	3.160246248769464

Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy.	6.147350703044636

The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia.	3.7666301338902555

Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment.	3.098539471764235

Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all.	2.7372574513089614

Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children.	2.4350770809397555

Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen between naval and the reproductive organs.	3.0120158999526074

Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women.	3.697034717100183

Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting.	2.7129855717175633

Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs.	3.3855273093922054

If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them.	3.92917084239844

Dead birth due to inborn syphilis.	5.284011857195709

The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases.	4.305576553408794

Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction.	5.226468495819966

Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye.	6.669013518105557

Contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease.	4.279095315282075

The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease.	4.125515480601218

Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs.	2.5675107814715314

Keep away from uncommon sexual relations.	5.284449248119403

Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse.	4.991286123933639

HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases.	4.38125881487348

It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities.	3.4177750223411927

Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed.	3.0299433166437653

Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment.	3.372972338483148

Tuberculosis is a contagious disease.	8.019434200546916

Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis.	6.677684406803845

The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex.	3.4491860905514335

A tuberculosis patient can infect 10-15 persons in a year.	4.068166514445732

About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases.	2.9349673295541154

Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes.	4.3752775658417145

This disease is found commonly in the lungs.	5.0118499666512335

In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease.	3.6116188057851852

Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much.	3.132794506083529

The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much.People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done.	2.8290624421383512

In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis.	3.555605622688197

According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year.	3.1601538902549997

The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India.	5.3229650485231135

Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac.	2.583287849745397

The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined.	3.2454156505980873

This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis.	2.8410722422084143

In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times.	3.512463681575757

Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy.	4.880069640786509

Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis of the lungs.	3.8682670925805684

The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm.	3.599134209498903

The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing.	5.010236379706793

The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis.	3.3264460238550524

Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X-ray is also used if necessary.	3.6307425722298143

List of training test centres where cancer can be tested.	3.1717501460779554

Tuberculosis can be completely cured.	8.305119824952595

If the patient does the treatment regularly.	6.7386277926973595

There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment.	2.7697942426002813

Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy.	3.9004442350472686

In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers.	3.6042215249934118

Which is called DOTS Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy.	2.9166175856252834

As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti-tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker.	2.1877449253383907

There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis.	5.780637965858733

Intensive phase which goes on for 2-3 months.	6.682299239776108

Continuation phase is of 4-5 months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking.	4.25674653599246

Under this program these medicines are taken thrice a week on alternate days for 2-3 months intensive phase.	3.084652061048546

After this phlegm is tested which if found negative , the patient is issued anti-tuberculosis drugs once in a week in the calendared multi-blistered combo pack.	2.5543014155324255

Remember , the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker.	3.98199380189587

During the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete.	3.316809416209465

You will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase.	3.894870420331058

The best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient can not infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take DOTS after the three phlegm test.	2.8352900548462925

Yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease.	5.202481267513368

Yellow fever is supposed to be the cause of several epidemics.	5.392194493055627

Yellow fever occurs due to an arbovirus of the family of flaviviridae.	4.933828061181836

Arbovirus is a gram positive single-formula RNA virus.	3.6568302991091843

Like malaria this virus also enters into humans through mosquito saliva.	3.2118348315761787

The mosquitoes that spread yellow fever aedes simpsaloni , aedes africanus and aedes aegypti.	2.7518772285425093

Children can be saved from tuberculosis by administering BCG vaccine.	4.369388879255898

Vaccine must be administered after birth as early as possible.	3.9248318722077586

Refer the patient for treatment to the near primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center.	2.753605081053307

Send the persons having cough with phlegm or without phlegm or phlegm with blood for three weeks or more to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for tests.	2.236279210229864

Keep enquiring about the tuberculosis patients whether they went to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for advice or not.	2.255918956077116

You must get all the babies of the area vaccinated for BCG with the help of the health workers women.	3.2328062111556477

Educate people all about the prevention of tuberculosis and controlling it.	4.32671483304638

Two medicine stores - Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar - have been built in the state to distribute medicines.	2.8569945016329767

So that the medicines could be made available to far-off districts in time.	2.9426791776770633

Supply of medicines is done by the Government of India.	4.935022346879802

To run Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme properly a four-wheeler vehicle has been made available by the Government of India in 8 districts Tehri , Paudi , Uttarkashi , Chamoli , Nainital , Pithauragarh , Almora and Dehradun.	2.095040444110328

Each treatment centres has been provided with a two-wheeler by the Government of India.	2.7963792593372356

Each Microscopic Centre has been provided with one binocular microscope.	3.6314350945087583

5 districts Haridwar , Udham Singh Nagar , Rudraprayag , Bageshwar and Champawat have been provided with four wheeler vehicle by the State Government.	2.262044676690309

Tetanus is a type of infection which occurs due to such bacteria that are found in dust , dirt and rusted metals.	3.9089795654621238

Muscles convulse because of the bacteria.	11.96121990122364

If the bacteria attack the muscles of the jaws then jaws convulse and the mouth neither opens nor it closes.	2.7877494613359466

Generally it is very fast but some of its slow cases shows up when a person is already infected with a flavivirus.	3.3192374244184637

After the infection the virus at first increases its number by reproducing locally , after that it spreads throughout the body through lymph carrying arteries.	2.7036509401632065

The muscle of the breathing pipe also convulse due to tetanus.	3.2982516994030275

This is a kind of bacteria that closes the lungs with phlegm a kind of sticky , wet material due to which such an acute sound comes out on coughing as if a dog is barking.	2.7035995122750762

The start of yellow fever starts suddenly 3 to 5 days after the infection.	4.047012445137202

Because of bacteria such organisms may also emerge that causes pneumonia and bronchitis infection of the lungs.	2.9732676773534474

Typhoid fever is such a disease that starts as an infection in the gastrointestinal passage and takes the form of a full-fledged disease.	3.6518737106151464

The cause of typhoid is a type of insect that is called salmonella typhi.	3.691994811420477

Each patient has different symptoms of it but some symptoms are included in common symptoms - periodic fever , headache , tiredness and weakness , change in behavior and stomach problems in the initial stage of the disease and constipation followed by loose motion.	2.6824544879204404

When any food item or beverage with salmonella typhi is taken then generally most of organic constituents become inactive by the presence of the acid present in the abdomen.	2.6005598307476085

If these insects reach the abdomen in great numbers then some of these insects reach the small intestine.	3.0123644263303015

Vaccine is the most effective and reliable solution for safety for typhoid fever.	4.298964647790398

Typhoid vaccination is recommended by different international and national health officers for persons traveling the regional areas.	2.569615055307278

This vaccination is also recommended for school children and youth and adults as well in the areas where typhoid fever is present as a major public health problem in the persons of that age group.	2.3724378989346615

As all of you know , Ayurveda is not just the method of treatment , it is also a science of life.	4.618335805391778

In Ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy.	3.423705921852001

The meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body.	4.629720797963613

If the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected.	4.7578249508678185

Healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body.	4.033664142467529

There are three properties of man - saatvik , rajasik and tamasik , these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it.	2.3170992004760107

The nature of man , his judgement and decisive ability , the multiplicity of his character till the extent of the entire personality depends on these three properties of saatvik , rajsik and tamsik properties.	2.1616637783805306

If there is increase in the rajsik and tamsik properties in man due to his food and life style then he can be surrounded with psychological disorders.	2.8937363977592576

According to few specialists , the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire , pride and intelligence.	2.917234879036681

Desire has control on brain and desire works according to the dictates of pride.	3.6556182641178308

Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all.	4.5433565453060965

With the increase of the effect of desire or pride on intelligence , the mental balance disrupts , mental frenzy and tension get incentive and as a result psychological disorders occur.	2.558205189967775

Due to this reason man does not stay fit for social life.	3.8310499363297508

With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders.	3.0777172790904266

This is the reason why together with consumption of nutritive food , excellent digestive capacity is given boundless importance in Ayurveda.	2.4840922472995617

Renowned Yoga and spiritual Deepak Chopra considers ' radiation and life ' also important together with brilliance for mental health.	2.477302815101212

According to Dr.Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body.	2.9042079203893936

Radiation is that inner physical strength which by increasing our comprehension power helps us in taking the right decision.	2.7271102509977725

Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders.	3.913597879285519

In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc.	2.2463098316122347

If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc.	2.4946755110122267

The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now.	2.207888904198971

Dr.Deepak Chopra says , ' the greatest effect of our mental health is seen on our body '.	3.28540337436444

In the same way the good and bad effects of physical health can be seen on the brain.	4.249826579379069

In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain.	3.421881573729728

Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice.	3.0235814401384977

After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery.	2.8965616428196164

He had also heard something about hernia.	4.521083059898247

According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc.	3.4903834666436113

Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur.	2.7533181712007604

The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct.	3.1685482607895294

Surgery is its only cure and the more the delay the more increased would be the discomfort.	3.240664699378487

After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away.	2.4790839434310943

He got the surgery done afterwards according to his physician ' s consultation or stayed in the maze of third or fourth opinion , I do not have any information of this.	2.4961619822491077

It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan.	2.717990040014214

Like the disease hernia construction of a saclike creation takes place from the swelling of tissues in any particular organ of the patient due to genetic or any other reason.	3.1282867252689326

Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach.	3.4413567739299604

That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach.	3.5111638269603214

But in the essay we will discuss in the context of hernia of stomach.	3.12461596957707

There are three main kinds of this type of hernia too - inguinal hernia affecting the groin region , umbilical hernia affecting the navel region and incisional area rising at the place of surgery of stomach.	2.512397888014568

Inguinal Hernia : This is a swelling connected to the inguinal canal on the inner walls of stomach and therefore it has been given the name of inguinal hernia.	3.981343672028981

The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia.	4.582815681708537

It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction.	3.2886738315401773

The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common.	3.8224118990014615

Umbilical hernia is related to stomach.	7.614803087504956

Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia.	3.308642670879381

Umbilical hernia is generally due to congenital disorders.	5.268301694002627

In fact one hole of the stomach wall which is connected to the umbilical nerve often gets closed before birth.	3.173620627268999

In some cases this does not happen because of which hernia erupts near navel center.	4.28344839534535

If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years.	3.5620488542079927

Large sized hernia which does not stop on their own , surgery is important for their treatment.	4.326121351927586

This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child.	5.896851183650386

In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth.	3.9365263783190336

But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak.	4.232812528557417

Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high.	4.13642980947628

Incisional hernia : A large population has to cross small surgical process of the stomach.	3.3320632787994975

Due to the reason of this surgery for the cracks to appear in the walls of stomach is also common.	3.631753464320975

Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high.	3.1849144656048423

2 to 10 percent cases of a few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type.	4.300507248705363

This problem can occur due to any one or many of the reasons like congenital reasons , due to increasing age , as a result of surgery , strain in muscles during pregnancy , reducing weight fast for decreasing obesity , diseases like marfan syndrome etc.	2.6643563344510293

It is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia.	5.682864766416751

During the examination of the swelled surface in the affected areas one gets to see swelling or rise.	3.086477312731998

In affected areas the complaint of pain can also occur.	6.148380335200944

Swelling increases on putting more pressure while lifting weight , micturition or defecation.	3.2929560148159522

The pain occurring due to the reason of hernia is very intense.	5.48032821573084

The intensity of pain increases immensely after physical labor or as the day ends.	3.0303644326473087

It is not difficult to recognize the symptoms of hernia.	4.486331827410342

Generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient , his family history and the examination of regions like groin , navel etc.	2.5150449827319576

Apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor.	3.761874146758614

Where making estimation of the disease is difficult there advice is given to get ultrasound or CAT scan done.	3.660671403651233

The aforesaid tests are often important for testing the chances of hydrosil.	4.084594589147797

The only possible treatment of hernia is surgery itself.	4.279043755338439

Riddance from this problem can be obtained only through surgery.	5.516436429803804

Famous by the name of hernioplasty this surgery is also done with the help of laparoscopy , endoscopy etc.	4.008572262902046

For the treatment of hernia the method of surgery which is brought into maximum use these days , that surgery is laparoscopy.	3.614140502012575

Due to being minimal invasive surgery , the surgery is done by putting an incision of only 2 - 3 mm to the patient.	3.3243344058029978

As a result the patient starts walking after few hours of surgery.	3.6935577033840397

He gets working in normal way after just two - three days of surgery and within 5 to 7 days he gets to his daily works.	2.9279708460263127

Under this technique of surgery , a laparoscope fixed with microscopic camera is made to enter the region of hernia through a small tube.	2.728704865535074

Surgeon gets helped by means of camera in seeing hernia and the adjoining regions on the video screen.	2.558520817699888

By means of another tube entered inside the stomach the surgeon rectifies hernia.	3.54019863732811

The rectification of hernia is done through the posterior part of walls of stomach.	4.252037684317222

A netted mesh is sewn on the destroyed area of hernia and this way riddance is got from the problem.	2.8492498268468562

With the help of laparoscopy hernia is almost a completely safe process.	3.3516920485173842

Yes , in approximately ten percent cases small complications after surgery are certainly got to be seen.	2.837268998058907

Generally during hernioplasty there is a danger of infection in the region of surgery , destruction in the adjoining blood vessels and nerves and harm to the nearby organs , etc.	3.4273401065841314

Where the presence of experienced doctor reduces its danger to minimum there a well equipped hospital is capable of controlling them in a better way in case of complication.	2.942846100140072

As I told you earlier , the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery and because of techniques of minimum incision it is also very safe.	3.263134016258388

But from fear of surgery or considering hernia as a less serious disease can put the patient ' s life at risk.	2.9252948291898373

It is worth mentioning that hernia is such a problem which does not get cured on its own and it keeps on increasing with time.	3.7788789901130957

If it is left to increase this way then its rectification through surgery becomes comparatively more difficult.	2.6812399358339967

In the situation of no treatment supply of blood gets affected due to blood vessels being pressed or due to obstruction especially in veins because of which there is danger of ischamial nephrosis and gangrene.	2.7028050434329955

Because of hernia due to obstruction in intestines the flow of matter present in them stops.	3.480600614059566

Consequently tightness , vomiting , release of gas , actions like discharge of faeces may get affected and immediate surgery becomes essential.	2.6598444592655794

In some cases the work efficiency of the organ affected with hernia or its nearby organs get affected and other physical complications start increasing.	2.662270675836217

With no treatment the danger of hydrosil to happen from hernia can also be there.	4.104803374173933

Therefore do not delay in hernia.	6.372622405960974

With delay not just the danger of life risk would increase but comparatively there would also be problems in surgery.	3.452112540056182

Diabetes is not a disease which happens only to aged and obese people.	4.386722051601852

The treatment of diabetes mellitus sugar found in urine occurring in children is far more difficult because the treatment of children is done especially by keeping in mind their physical and emotional condition.	3.30006793383757

In diabetes the quantity of sugar in blood increases immensely because the body fails to produce the insulin being secreted from pancreas.	3.6193384747265704

Diabetes is of two types.	6.06745309574257

At some point of time type 1 diabetes was called ' juvenile onset diabetes '.	3.147905889099173

This is that condition of patient when the insulin is secreted less or not secreted at all.because the immune system attacks the cells of pancreas.	2.9115437703672655

This disease may occur with great speed in the age of 6 to 13 years.	4.0629020021167355

In type 2 diabetes the body does not stay sensitive to the insulin produced inside it.	3.4249481537328763

This disease occurs in extremely obese teenagers who have this disease in their family.	3.957523325273852

Type 2 diabetes grows gradually.	9.601614499985777

The symptoms of Type 2 diabetes are frequent micturition , drinking lots of water , dryness of throat , laziness , high pulse rate and blurred vision.	2.345100416561677

The cure of the disease is ascertained by the test of urine and fasting blood sugar more than 126 mg.	4.262791571541913

For the parents who have children with diabetes keeping their children away from sweets and apart from taking samples to monitor blood sugar seeing them getting injected to take insulin may seem to be very painful but this may have to be done several times in a day.	2.2649590273935747

In such situation they can get great relief from counselling.	3.696342633102498

You should consider diabetes as an obstinate problem and not a disease whose cure will surely be found some time or the other.	2.4849634410542927

The teachers , family members and kin members should also be aware of his disease.	3.734419521956937

The young people can fight the disease by taking medicines as advised by the doctor and bringing change in the lifestyle.	3.4835417083396605

For this they should reform the eating pattern , reduce weight and do exercise.	3.006093596427803

Keep in mind that you have to make your diabetic child as self - dependent as possible so that for him taking injection becomes as easy as brushing teeth.	2.5036605326243118

He can learn to do all these on his own by the time he is of 10 years of age.	3.584958498070488

When does eye problem occur ?.	6.640186179182956

If your child has a problem in doing school work.	4.390447001301798

If he feels pain in eyes , throbbing pain or tiredness.	4.494988883458415

He does not see the writing on the black board clearly.	3.5634595305622683

If he brings his book very close to eyes while reading the book.	3.0419634374194686

Then take him to an eye specialist immediately.	5.490258452295935

Often the teachers of children detect such problems on seeing and make you cautious.	2.8623572056881494

Important information connected to antibiotic.	6.813484980292112

If your doctor asks you to keep an eye on the symptoms of the disease for 48 hours then follow his advice.	3.5805045922527157

If you are said that the child has to take antibiotics for 5 days and in three days only all the symptoms of disease vanish then also do not stop taking medicine before the completion of 5 days.	3.449693565153982

This way by stopping the medicine in between the immune capacity of bacteria increases , consequently that problem can again start to grow.	3.229380273202514

Bhringraj is also called bhangra.	11.448935257739453

The very small plant of bhringraj is 10 - 12 fingers long.	3.907076400237175

Bhangra is spread on the ground.	6.104132941882917

The plant of bhangra grows there where water keeps flowing.	3.1452884058742416

The plant of bhangra is found in great numbers on the banks of streams and rivers.	3.0401663096070797

The small flowers of bhringraj are white in color.	3.487470935372809

The small flowers of bhringraj are seen from March till September.	2.9440926007611137

Bhringraj is found in the entire India.	11.270765024830219

Like abortion , premature delivery , premature rupture of the amniotic fluid sac , dislocation of placenta premature , weakening of the foetus in the womb , the foetus getting crossed , inverted or skewed.	2.2970329657389006

The child getting stuck at the time of delivery.	5.159659192258803

The need of caesarean operation for the delivery.	4.127713193505879

Complications while the operation , need to remove the uterus.	5.526390773450017

Excessive bleeding post delivery.	8.882186582257072

Getting anaemic owing to excessive bleeding.	6.06315358259506

Increase in the size of fibroid.	8.11920460746235

Many times the cure of uterine glandular swelling is problematic.	4.079484888734793

The size of uterus also increases in ovarine knot-endometriosis , pregnancy edinomyosis etc.but a skilful gynaecologist can easily find out the disease after a careful examination.	2.4573562079515856

The following tests are important for fibroid.	5.684232898355923

Sonography through abdomen or vagina transabdominal and transvaginal.	3.6437483922933565

Laparoscopy , hysteroscopy , M.R.I.if needed.	4.82187997655039

H.S.G.if the doctor thinks essential.	4.313857636689953

After finding out the condition of fibroid in the uterus with these tests , it can be ascertained by which method it can be removed.	4.097475225346116

Mere presence of the glandular swelling is not a prerequisite for its removal.	3.6902545605895645

If the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time , this treatment in itself is satisfactory.	2.9020858307009774

There is a knot , and therefore it has to be removed , it is not necessary.	4.223918959157625

If the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously , if the woman is panicking , the symptoms increase , the symptoms of bleeding , pain and pressure appear , then only it should be removed.	2.901927299263273

If the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy.	3.498239879740255

The fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers.	5.437753698415448

There are two types of operations for fibroid.	4.67940517514241

Myomactomy removal of knot only , this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy opening stomach.	2.801267044368267

Just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children.	4.369058510018067

Hysterectomy : If the age is not less , the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor.	3.3537689382369424

Medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia.	3.2671101224043797

Some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid.	4.836245181606782

But due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced.	4.310360389696577

The condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine.	4.584290706171881

The modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis through laser Nd-YYAG.	3.533296082616968

The blocking of uterine artery ambolization.	5.847150381429301

In modern treatment the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl particles or gel foam powder through a pipe entered through the thigh artery after anaesthesising it.	2.0259742131104037

By blocking the uterine artery the blood supply available to the tumor gets obstructed and the tumor reduces up to 60 %.	2.690488567790916

A skilful gynaecologist is capable of doing proper treatment after considering everything.	3.65499172411018

Therefore , it is unnecessary to be scared of leiomyoma disease.	3.3249804182077325

The investigation of the secrets of brain -.	5.364310249302517

If we gradually cut open with a saw and separate the upper part of the skull of a man after making him unconscious on an operation table then by peering inside we can ourselves see the live brain with our own eyes.	2.1649820268462343

Similarly , neuro-surgeons operate the brain by cutting the skull bones with saw and drill.	2.8768515097430325

Bacterial dysentery occurs from a special type of bacteria bacilli.	5.2875413206083

Many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it.	2.544072296514016

Through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself Einstein , C.V.Raman , Tagore and Shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas.	2.2460444023185437

By look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity.	3.175708832043012

On investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell , neuron or nerve cell.	3.09607926236039

In bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm.	3.414707528092476

Disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment.	3.501528046241081

The disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in India.	4.581187843028348

In the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and a very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell.	3.1780858221237587

In women , men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner.	3.898831229524372

By disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them.	3.1411126263676756

The matter which fascinated Kahal the most , that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells.	2.856823464016024

In this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell.	2.6113359393129274

The axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains a certain distance between the two.	3.0977468081132566

Kahal studied these network places with great minuteness , which later on were given the name of synapse by Sir Charles Sherrington.	2.7405638270013104

How does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell ?.	3.4557787940587716

There are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse.Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine.	2.1537027135095475

Consciously a valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over , it has to take the help of a chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded.	2.704143563718444

After all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system ?.	3.0508791493673892

If we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only , not haphazard.	2.578225881877684

Every synapse gives unidirectional instruction , because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only.	3.161779236582172

In fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire.	2.8020880650069673

But the direction gets decided at every synapse , because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell.	2.7024537152045123

Thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction.	3.0577716415975846

Without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos.	2.4071064338610975

The second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is a delay of approximately the thousandth part of a second or 1.0 milli second.	3.266787175599167

This way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time.	3.772157806315822

The more the synapses in a neuronal circuit , the slower would be the communication in them.	2.7567375532242386

Synapse has one more use as well.	4.841346074054284

Because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain.	2.9001204102574025

These chemical substances are called medicines.	6.042123106075869

Many medicines given by the doctors today - like anaesthesia to make unconscious , tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace , and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only.	2.400449707419472

Why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself , to understand it will not be now difficult.	2.9554406244172453

Therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses.	3.7036210831385468

The person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery.	4.200074368633717

Every cell in itself appears to be very simple as a unit , but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually.	2.697615701933039

Perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence , consciousness and memory.	3.1849581049728437

From the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts.	2.7860714162925904

Because of being enclosed in a box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep a direct contact with all the distant parts of the body.	3.3281125614236085

Therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important.	3.43409372600152

Like a thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back , spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones.	3.4165650682029582

At regular interval , through the medium of 31 spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body.	3.0488993486494116

Each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs , and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles.	2.345099086698909

The spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis , it does not disturb the brain for everything.	3.016619913456801

For example , it maintains a proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect.	2.9648990520277216

We withdraw hand when all of a sudden a pin pierces finger.	3.333351449598385

This reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord.	4.914102080155109

The simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only.	3.030386958574021

Apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like a highway alone.	3.772417478720606

Thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious.	3.109229836079652

But now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord.	3.8216845169860387

The brain starts just as we enter the head.	3.9914610798022516

Or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain.	4.5249843874454445

On seeing it appears as if the brain is like a very big walnut resting on a strong stem or branch.	3.3969052095970866

Therefore we can divide the brain into 2 parts.	4.111166996336879

One is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it.	3.019708743667599

In fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord , and it is also situated in its straight line , but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively.	3.3236121386322393

The various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone.	3.1385869693297255

Like , breathing , beating of heart , controlling of blood pressure , digestion of food etc..	3.9834703119771255

A sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in a moment.	2.8827301490846824

But there is nothing to get scared in this.	4.741550222406888

Nature has placed this very important control-room in a very safe place at the center of the head.	3.3886230496406653

At times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely , and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged.	2.1278958225147058

The ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death.	5.043225004291729

The same happens when the criminals are hanged.	3.982934398064394

Medulla alone is the originating place of 7 out of 12 cranial nerves as well.	3.0825579049106206

The cranial nerves control the muscles of face , tongue , shoulders etc., bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs.	2.808752804876191

If we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and mid-brain come.	2.5836851489201758

Mid-brain and pons mainly work as junction.	4.110058761879725

In a way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway.	2.6912117018641792

Like a skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs.	3.307614818104183

First , because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags.	3.2029373378165147

We do not fall even when fleeing , running , doing acrobats , bending forward - backward.	3.1244151172795114

Second , this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely.	2.9702938748314827

Cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions.	3.624235338819778

Earlier we mentioned 12 cranial nerves out of which 7 had their origin from medulla.	3.3318402842032375

Similarly 4 more emanate from pons mid-brain.	4.376937183723595

Their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face.	3.5270188847866173

Now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain - cerebrum or fore-brain.	3.086503792677896

From the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state.	3.982808733833561

From darkness to light.	8.934660121867164

We have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brain-stem or cerebellum.	4.173311271209682

As if we are sleeping in a very deep sleep.	5.1443686051111275

But just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake.	4.902350639100838

We start feeling comfort , sadness.	6.855889011303067

We feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like a machine.	3.283511368931208

We start saying I am there , I am doing , I am liking it.	2.8598882873750657

Does any machine feel like this ?.	5.699275357227873

None of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours.	3.339375932619581

Let us forget for a moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see.	2.4743987835993546

The brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both.	4.448239134371969

And why should not it be  After all both have to control respiration , heart , food , blood pressure etc..	2.8062252921361077

While jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body.	3.6752553227559672

But when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is a huge difference between mouse and man.	3.621712111064671

Our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain.	3.5146755079758765

Because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body.	3.4342127348248748

Although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours.	3.40028607194986

The weight of brain of our closest relative , monkeys , is just half a kilogram.	2.903130738749769

The weight of the brain of whale is 8000th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around 50th part of the weight of our body.	3.9027207827828447

If the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than 150 times of the brain of whale.	2.9779781088293307

There is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been a riddle for us even now.	3.6463280294598013

This is divided into two parts , which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres.	3.609711930949147

Strange thing is this , that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body.	3.5001074810554043

All the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side.	2.9942275740588453

This very system is found in all the organisms.	8.041157447229864

The effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body.	5.15783104448955

Similarly , on pricking a needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere.	3.5600986651608233

Like a modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in a very good manner.	3.3326820840761893

The upper thick surface of 3 mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only.	2.661582048411363

In the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread.	2.865867696465107

The small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle.	2.949750486491785

The most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision , while a very small part at the center does hearing.	3.2034085793959384

The system of olfaction is at the lower surface.	5.081636296247791

But we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain.	2.779513546964572

Only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves.	3.5750094279776654

So who is seeing , hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum ?.	3.8417515733135836

Is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain ?.	3.4938111771963385

This is a complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed.	2.43563270225629

Approximately 1 cm wide and 6 cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called ` motor cortex ' and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone.	3.249325122800544

The representation of body here also is inverted only : head down and legs up.	2.8013730568948985

What is the secret behind this chaotic system , even no one knows this nicely.	2.8743669988627087

It can happen that one day you may solve this mystery.	3.4702226114923107

A similar strip near the motor cortex is called ` sensory cortex ' where all the sensations from the other half of the body come.	3.120293598776193

But if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed.	2.498772462147307

Then only we realize pain.	6.781172898562364

The pain is in finger , this is only a natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger.	2.9550753059329016

Roughly we can conclude this , that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system.	3.300385871827643

If the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted.	3.0941878713903943

Similarly , the moment a nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment.	2.4936104239445935

We can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like.	3.901443574331166

This is called paralysis.	9.161466612773053

Only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut.	3.604818332295702

Similarly , now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain.	2.981991429702864

Similarly , we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs.	3.514548345157018

In today 's mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life.	2.6208797680810862

We say that heart is like a pump , eyes like a camera , nerves are like electric wires.and brain ?.	2.7632097067836696

Quickly the answer would be that the brain is a computer.	4.500667351058235

Today at every place , whether classroom or shop , office or home , the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations.	2.41197134773204

We have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers.	3.1435428915852244

Our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication , division , addition and subtraction.	2.955389718110414

But are the methods of both same ?.	5.8357095905492535

In future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us ?.	2.461801170943342

Does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big , or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate ?.	2.9497029870665923

Such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance.	4.077147917842717

In the efforts to solve the questions , on one the hand the development of computers is getting a lot of help as well.	3.0830875540377987

Right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in a better way.	3.795156177419912

Due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in a better way we should first make its small and simple model.	2.396673611852666

In schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes , steam engines , radio etc.so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these.	2.288811450050545

Why not we study a small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain ?.	2.447450880945603

We should make a child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work , multiply 9 by 9 , and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with 9 again.	2.328371182276689

The computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off.	3.4484911465718504

But the child will throw away his paper and pencil in a few minutes and will in fact start questioning you , oh , why are you making me do this useless work.	2.373116428833308

What does this mean : I am tired , leave , I will not do anymore.	2.8907970936933545

If we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes , while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer.	2.398950986676292

The child soon gets bored with useless work.	3.7756294429448753

There is unlimited variation in his thinking , not definiteness like computer.	2.9441919253417126

He will suddenly find out a new solution to any question which no one had told him before.	2.7093208848253676

Will any computer start thinking about gravitation like Newton when an apple falls on it ?.	2.6274565940928807

Or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like Darwin ?.	2.901484200497669

One more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone , not in computer.	3.5931043840005317

Many times we commit such mistakes while speaking.	4.086198508603516

The professor of Oxford William Spooner is very famous for this.	3.13688076798472

Thus it is also called spoonerism.	10.941631963751286

At present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain.	2.9569920301714943

If we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions.	2.7976542922318015

It is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence , consciousness , prudence etc to which the best of today 's computers have not been able to reach.	3.422582424849618

In future it will ever be able to reach , there is doubt in it.	3.9138194928009225

But there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain , and here lies its actual usefulness.	3.0303243151144925

The computer can do any calculation very fast , while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil.	2.4932148295850354

The computer which plays chess made by Dr Hans Berliner selects the most suitable move from 175000 moves on analyzing them in just 1 second.	2.068652372428753

Till that time we will not even be able to count up to five.	4.539688337376122

That is why in controlling fast moving spaceships , rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer.	2.6267926260737786

Similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them.	2.7140819196636694

Now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects.	2.624016621764804

In one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only.	3.3575477857632285

The way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette.	2.7141521537842372

But if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken ?.	2.5729258007220914

Is it therefore that we have to spend 20-25 years on education in schools and colleges ?.	3.5227742758636795

No matter how advanced or clever the computer is , it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn.	2.3079143998819065

Whether 2 has to be added to 2 or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science , our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them.	2.4512228548753

Our brain has programmed the computer , but who programs our brain ?.	3.152664232753676

Opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned anti-reflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain , that is , cerebrum.	3.0138719617904113

Therefore these have the maximum importance in man.	4.68738997464651

By making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other.	2.251198822697151

Pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education.	4.035860987647512

Perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through a systematic language.	2.820967243613561

First we point to a child a moving elephant on a road and say that see that is elephant.	2.5810064815957796

Then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it.	2.801522289834335

Finally , only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain.	2.859803050530329

Is it not a matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge , black quadruple having long trunks.	2.5378574997506895

It seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain.	3.129253329650818

Can the present human society be imagined without language ?.	3.571018592517319

Is science , history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language , or not make them permanent by writing ?.	2.566160657277548

Scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language , but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them.	2.4348338059007295

In the past few years Roger Sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain.	2.394747625905078

While receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm on December 8 , 1981 he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them.	2.341042797865258

When there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosum-the bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle , so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side.	2.3050125398426267

The daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results.	2.641681904240114

Though we certainly get description of two-headed animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will a person with two brains or split brain think actually.	2.2036160960186284

In the words of Roger Sperry if a person with split brain attended a party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him.	2.55258335302298

Both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body.	2.455614207261396

But after an in-depth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is a huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres.	3.2924750688244186

Everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal.	3.9384906411040097

In maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous.	2.9578374778641585

The same thing has also been seen in all the animals.	5.857533709911882

It can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective , and like a class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere.	2.8054540642375283

If we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this -.	2.4730687991233338

Left hemisphere - language speaking , cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard , maths , analysis of problems , estimation of time.	2.5053919260873276

Right hemisphere - geometry , painting , instrumental music , organization of facts , estimation of space.	2.828529342349755

Whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division.	3.5085716102034397

But because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed.	3.0238045553272124

On the contrary the matter of the patients of Roger Sperry is in fact indeed exquisite.	4.072485253795026

As a simple example if a pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded.	2.6507377294456838

The contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin.	3.2927238748393215

With how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments !.	2.5611325671894436

One attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth.	3.0272339772850545

In any huge class some students would be uncommon.	3.5188200299314043

That is , instead of playing , writing , eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand.	2.9526636883781916

These left handed players however have a distinct grandeur in cricket.	2.954975666979607

What is their ratio in your school or classroom ?.	3.7513053411582336

In what subjects do they get more marks : Or in what do they take more interest : How is their speaking ability.	2.356642399982118

If we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys , small kids and adults in this respect.	2.7109176740910845

But firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale.	3.888592263667751

To reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this.	3.075750303089426

Breast cancer is a scary name for women.	4.364792433271755

Thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days.	3.2929583511572074

Maximum succumb financially to breast cancer.	5.492933324909609

The patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery.	3.045214047702079

If cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity , even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent.	3.081566056142408

This way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture.	3.2262867565319846

In contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits.	3.9308948387672893

Many methods of cancer detection like mammography , MRI , CT scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible.	2.5543041391468457

In such situation the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography.	2.600728461486271

In infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays.	3.474720374937948

Greek and Egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body.	3.9821854179308915

Sir William Herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in 1800.	3.320511572856033

But till 1970 it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine.	3.000506394725532

On passing the rays through the prism , the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light.	2.8788345607001444

In this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately.	2.3382377961251066

This ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ.	4.268145577668259

Electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments.	2.7761690215486063

Different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition , which on recognition the disease is diagnosed.	3.4284813571433306

Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment.	3.5447956897889035

Of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important.	3.334918534802849

Because of less information in it , it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography.	3.562608920665916

Lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography.	3.786157541883506

The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc..	3.507341293453946

Several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes a very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases.	3.3365183874756545

Any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called STD , that is , sexually transmitted disease.	2.91842521974055

Neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from STD.	5.38047196722946

Some infections together with the complications related to womb , disease of liver may even lead to HIV AIDS.	3.419816352751841

There are approximately 20 types of sexually transmitted infections.	4.547371867520257

STD spreads through bacteria , parasites and virus.	4.810188368148428

Out of them some of the STD which spread rapidly are as following.	3.270949777237278

HPV , that is , human pappiloma virus is a viral disease.	3.6603689672060185

HPV disease engulfs around 80 % of the total people who make physical relations.	3.7176542863977953

The infection of HPV is of more than 100 types and 3 types of infections out of these spread through sex.	3.2381911899537084

HPV infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women.	4.233921075520394

On being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus , hips or neck.	2.8028270595664924

For protection from HPV infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible.	3.158074528915574

Even if you make relations then also use latex condoms.	3.8917226040666346

Complete riddance from HPV infection can not however be obtained.	3.6967241789120115

But by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief.	3.8150435661757607

Genital herpes is also a viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners.	4.31740667691155

Genital herpes is of two types.	5.5085147262386895

After the genital herpes infection , inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus , which causes pain.	2.6609423829773875

Genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching.	3.620561979257427

Apart from this , in women , this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge.	3.479581462316128

In order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners.	2.7737514846252544

Even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection.	3.0892412717686697

If pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby.	3.02715835473557

Syphilis is a bacterial infection.	8.156109958688946

Syphilis affects lips , mouth , kidneys and genitals.	4.787108620105869

Apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her child.	3.098699456326485

In the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain.	3.794490917368747

At times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all.	3.9503906914479026

Many times people ignore it.	6.52312133175002

These inflammations are not permanent , that is , they keep coming and going.	3.346816271573952

Therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years.	4.212620362970574

Apart from diseases like AIDS , syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness , mental imbalance and heart attack.	3.1415303386807216

Many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection.	5.089903318967831

If you are infected and pregnant , then you can even lose the child.	4.101794138422049

For safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also.	3.553894875043491

Get the infection checked at regular intervals.	4.957317933332794

If the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done.	4.184811376289072

With the help of injection one can control it within 24 hours.	3.6405208169119465

Tykomonosis infection spreads through a parasite.	6.529570611429177

The main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women.	3.673892544368878

Apart from this , itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also a common symptom.	3.3517078484902716

There are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men.	4.330130181250443

But many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis.	3.2739792227369975

Pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly.	4.572404069608466

According to Dr Preeti maximum STD are bacterial.	3.609467244372063

For safety against STD , If together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased.	2.8468298778132657

Health and regular check up -.	10.02711257904617

Generally most of the women do not get regular checkups , because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards.	5.64033754066141

Generally , in girls , pap starts occurring after the age of 15 years.	3.484588679394217

The white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap.	2.893448627764509

It is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of 12 years.	3.0726324720577987

The pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of 40 years.	3.8607411701273513

But still , on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of 30 years.	3.2314589768792947

Pap test is of two types.	6.019165289613046

Leukoria test is done to find about common infections.	5.278492101509291

Leukoria test completely depends on physical relations.	4.547464943828213

Those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex , they do not need the leukoria test a great deal.	3.1605217051772074

Pap infection test is also of two types.	5.849001065387536

One , which is a simple test , with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled.	3.5913868287306507

Second , ` hyper plasia ' is the second important test for pap infection.	3.6297034056632898

With ` hyper plasia ' pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not.	3.762791243403482

The doctors generally advise for ` hyper plasia ' test to women of 40 years.	3.4324155969968

The homeopathic doctor Minu Mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of 30 years.	2.5753884315424838

Though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer.	2.7708011990651937

Liquid pap test is done for this.	7.4551849801651455

Breast cancer is engulfing Indian women very fast.	3.934258915822512

According to a recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal , ignore it.	2.7325080091830913

According to Dr Pankaj Kumar of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital , women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up.	2.267366551815841

Women of 20-29 years should get mammography done once every third year.	3.8679594872096668

Not just this , together with this one should also do BSF or breast self exam.	3.3967109881691977

Breast Self Exam should be started right after the age of 20 years.	3.520601556226829

Normally , doing BSF may keep you vigilant for breast cancer , but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node , unwanted pain or any type of secretion.	2.6366997176264086

The hormonal changes start happening after the age of 30 years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is a persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it.	3.604361261777783

Thus , getting ultrasound done every year is very important.	4.7620208890658136

The treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this , on being diagnosed at the right time.	2.8214873013863704

After an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done.	3.527037971825999

With the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test.	3.139779209646271

After its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not.	2.9752058492663185

Though biopsy test is a part of your regular checkups , but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes , pain in the lower abdomen , sudden growth of hair on face , increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done.	2.688636289209903

Often after crossing 40 women stop paying attention towards their health.	3.4699219810768684

They feel that now they do not need any regular checkups , but this is not proper.	4.176372227774051

There are many such diseases after 40 which may take awful shape on not taking precaution.	2.8299735432813042

The FSH test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started.	3.485496260681331

In FSH test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause.	4.1652967883529985

Pelvic exam test must be done annually.	5.97038386635114

With the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus , reproductive organs , bladder etc can become known.	2.8782914362137872

If any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test.	3.933600482249002

One 's cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining 45 years.	3.3302400712855045

If you are less than 45 years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done.	2.9832442808831656

Not just this , if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after 40.	4.417441443185618

Maximum women in India give birth to children till the age of 30-35 years.	3.917795793877771

After delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity.	4.397864643765327

Because of this a lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs.	3.608775185371534

Although 60 years is the age for the test of osteoporosis , but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery.	2.847301747944075

Bone densitometry is also done for calcium.	6.6093247262759105

By the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out.	4.485851690835004

After the age of 45 years the danger of colon cancer increases in women.	4.916366323213418

Although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in India , but still regular checkups is important.	3.803347741993313

Every year FOBT test should be done for colon cancer.	5.42145552939854

Sample of human fecus is taken in FOBT test.	4.246992759278899

After the FOBT test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc.is coming in your stomach or not.	3.224704336790503

Flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years.	4.824737373571493

By flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver , stomach or reproductive organs.	3.168177970333694

Colonoscopy must be done once every 10 years.	6.770597894108874

That is , one at 40 then second at 50 years of age.	3.4064818303618436

There are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval.	2.5419031976869393

These tests are - blood pressure , diabetes , depression and obesity fatness.	4.107119342640171

Poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes.	3.095235984535165

If the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases 8 times.	4.095792574605087

Because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled.	3.0618385973520703

If you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of 120 increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast.	2.762265752014044

It also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need.	3.181324447182251

If in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted , without getting broken ?.	2.197919729272713

Many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette , chewing tobacco , obesity , eating excessive salt , mental disturbance , deficiency of physical labor , the elasticity of the vessels decrease , it starts contracting.	2.266132579017639

This only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become a common disease today.	4.108617572376426

Nature has created our vessels only for bearing a certain pressure.	3.2024444110520474

As a result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end : brain , heart and kidneys.	3.481171561053163

But it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high.	3.9006332641537913

Otherwise , first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure.	3.7221088891272838

Impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body.	2.5709227944166995

Both the main arteries open in the right auricle.	5.653684798908776

If we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing.	3.4413494012572587

One tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries.	4.023810631441546

In short , the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty.	4.30466652752923

Medical surgery does this only.	7.343332126713988

If we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead.	2.6677796910109275

Blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification.	4.198432764044597

Without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going.	4.078150864370957

Heart - lung-machine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only , by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible.	2.843396020288705

The heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body.	4.4005990249081375

The heart too needs fuel for its work.	4.172333464001276

The heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers.	3.547179842185334

Close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches.	3.228294336485333

Coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart.	4.037575527135534

The meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like a crown on the heart.	2.5935750137300104

The amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with a crown.	3.8691121054002515

On the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack.	3.6958523241223555

The collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs , getting reflected and taking a photograph of this is only called ultrasonography.	2.808061604712753

These days there is discussion about ultrasonography.	4.9827692249475115

But the knowledge about the technique of USG started right from the beginning of this century.	4.082770932877517

It was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released.	2.9877624647049337

Which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of USG.	3.003624400883702

In this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for a moment and then catches the reflected rays back.	2.317561440739972

Instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate.	2.8325969226944037

The popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of USG is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother.	3.732886043416923

But it is not like that.	6.664235360760292

Stomach is like a closed pouch , inside which gall bladder , liver , intestines , kidneys , lymph glands , spleen etc are situated.	2.594414682288702

Similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated.	4.031214199286994

For the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special USG is important.	3.23280040019746

Normal or special USG save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery.	3.4395776478550193

Liver is a very important organ of the body.	6.711259328660414

The more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them.	2.9984781090585764

The infections of liver , cyst , normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer , the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound.	2.9297288267939297

Similarly , if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer , then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound.	2.8484914196980284

The kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart.	5.185656564318706

Because of the life-long working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive.	3.6536362099838686

Whether there is kidney or not , if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst , stone , swelling , pus , this also is told to us by the ultrasound test.	2.6464424910165394

Till some time ago in order to find this , X-ray was taken by injecting dye in blood , which used to take a lot of time and it was also painful.	3.3376698907132676

The problem of thyroid gland is also very common.	7.422134841579297

For the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is a less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity.	2.531440298898403

The diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid , prostate , adrenal etc is possible through USG.	4.201538677757413

One very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer.	3.9546355517019087

It is believed that U.S.G.mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular X-ray mammography.	2.478155055558003

It gives cure in 75-90 % cases.	6.774054589472095

USG mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity.	3.761508887968745

The extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere.	3.8129017796847373

Whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not , whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing , all these are found from the USG test of the uterus.	2.966424709672255

Many serious complications are found in the foetus like the non-formation of the head or even the water getting filled in it hydrocephalous etc..	3.3782512593954084

Ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems.	5.699799514161845

Apart from the correct information about the foetus , one more important information which found through USG is in the matter of placenta.	3.0215433394679123

The properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta.	3.2971914700186646

By ultrasound all the deformities can be detected , the status of the placenta , any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc..	3.2540270775460898

By which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus.	3.5301990790181628

By USG that is , ultrasonography a lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine.	3.8987447351454056

Very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs.	3.3167797898345777

So important , simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for a hideous work.	2.7238135714461844

Every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus.	2.65095265216804

In some form or the other we participate in the pre-delivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons.	2.692961637247042

Because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight.	2.97779912202066

On getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be a congenital disease or a disease occurring after a year of birth.	3.282422244701177

The rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries.	4.528069528545049

According to the Blind Control in India there are 1,20,00,000 blind people in the country out of which 80 % people are victims of cataract.	3.3384721338853303

Though this blindness can be rectified through surgery.	4.46950645409711

The natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases.	3.206499769647326

This is called white cataract.	6.919645827069144

In the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles.	3.05012621867838

After a condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles.	4.805639905862008

At present the only permanent solution for this is surgery.	4.211305769215033

To make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable a very new technique has been developed which is called ` phaco emulsification ' technique.	3.235407234888582

To take out the cataract with the help of the technique of ` phaco emulsification ' a small incision of 3 mm is made.	3.443424132380277

Through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye.	3.2596902232092475

Now through this small incision a foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye.	3.083442768623835

Since this incision is very small , therefore there is no need to put suture to this.	3.623201576587265

Thus , it is called the suture less surgery.	6.920825428025258

The special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after a day.	3.3631573183322474

He is finally given the number of spectacles after a week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months.	2.9835262523594666

The surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care.	4.155753322187704

To do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes , both hands and both legs.	2.9401879604187586

One leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes.	3.01975729334346

One hand handles the needle of phaco machine , the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument.	2.8788193639781205

Therefore , ` phaco emulsification ' technique is costlier than normal surgeries.	3.8191698688872506

Phaco machine is proving to be a boon for the patients of cataract.	5.21750786222921

The surgery done by phaco machine is easy , painless and can be done in less time.	3.9466363134837326

You can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part.	3.54765958479928

Especially , such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus.	3.1838814224995065

More than 50 lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number.	3.3071139923617205

Till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that.	2.908789438096781

But now a technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery.	3.7248290015653405

The technique of lithoptysis was used in 1980 for the first time and from 1987 it has become available in India as well.	3.3750477888090087

In the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves.	2.7612537524072898

The pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine.	3.34541588245666

Today it has gained credibility as the most safe , simple and theoretical procedure.	2.989201315464556

If the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is a need of some common blood and urine tests , X-rays of the kidneys and IBP X-ray.	4.020763893911948

Generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process.	5.262455939032885

The action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by a sleep inducing injection.	2.5026386118593718

The time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number.	3.948472747525566

Generally this is done in one episode.	7.813054140506622

One episode in this is of 30-40 minutes and a gap of 4 days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body.	2.776855522732414

When these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced.	3.9362121895922386

Some patients may be feeling slight piercing , but there is no pain.	4.174595970599913

Most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment.	4.961865669492072

As an exception , one may have to be put under vigilance for 24 hours.	3.8307027698780134

Post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after 3 months.	4.482608787366463

Then by taking a new X-ray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not.	3.0504298197824475

Since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been 8-10 years , information about its long term effects have not been gathered.	2.9420405113775003

Approximately 90 % of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis.	4.90396705552469

In some the action may have to be repeated twice or more.	4.230292086419466

The expense at every sitting amounts to nearly 8 thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor.	2.41171977277813

Presently , this facility is available in 30-35 cities in our country.	4.677898781350707

In lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision.	5.503164822311373

You can start the normal daily life in a week.	4.537563175911251

The action can be repeated if the stone forms again.	3.9214908739078567

The technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged , patients of diabetes , blood pressure or heart disease.	3.0736815171126124

The problem of uncontrolled micturition -.	6.498768460498245

in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening.	3.8706673109834893

The tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small.	4.33704277103946

Babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine.	3.8714335263843696

Maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only.	4.1191668967562105

They stop wetting clothes and bed.	5.3973706691886285

Not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women.	3.628493842439046

It has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be 5 to 7 % in the age group of 15-44 years , 8 to 15 % in age group of 45-64 years of age and 16 to 20 % in women of 65 years and more.	3.389518646988759

The complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women.	3.437187740607732

Permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment.	4.049273481747043

Urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder , urinary system , when there is tension due to coughing , sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes.	2.6501945282614097

The most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage.	5.573016389622042

If the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled.	2.9136275418691278

This problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder.	5.973259134387059

But in several women its cause is not diagnosed.	4.471962109227849

This problem may occur in some due to mental tension.	4.464966184421254

Women often try to control urine for long time.	4.675504387103669

The urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less.	2.8270577985787333

If from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum fistula or genitals then also the problem may arise.	3.3563335579547076

There is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex , long stuck delivery.	3.275783378951207

Though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret , but the treatment of this problem is possible.	4.626985395744618

The doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests.	3.5915852247645677

To find out the reasons , the help of tests like the test of urine , bed rest , measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder , the speed of the flow of urine , the pressure of the leakage of urine , ultrasound , x-ray , CT scan etc is taken.	2.8899733176054423

The solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause.	6.457688720909406

If the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast.	3.4832808005386453

If there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery.	2.595036776167016

If there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it.	4.324394746867833

If the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved.	3.5576897226429667

If the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques , medicine and surgery.	3.767146232788881

If not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water , liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity.	4.357184925871066

Do not consume tea , coffee , carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it.	3.082002959565025

Reduce the weight if the weight is excessive.	5.810918892606277

If infested with any type of allergy , cough , constipation then get the treatment done.	4.24724572263005

Do exercise of pelvis and stomach.	5.87663164215452

Mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination.	4.4904766287485645

Tension , worry are lethal for the physical and mental health.	4.689420111254223

Stay away from these as much as possible , live life happily , free of tension and worry.	3.363426625129568

In these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure , coughing , sneezing.	3.8451235937182897

If relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis.	3.7761542768100704

Various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients.	4.938856589305745

Similarly , plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube.	2.72507991449909

If relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery.	3.2523038546035843

This is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination.	3.559836282342605

If this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then a proper treatment of disease is essential.	5.19008603905191

If the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination.	3.1472931026966435

Stop urine for a definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to 3-4 hours gradually , do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it.	2.649909983506976

Control on urine is done through the medium of brain , spinal cord and nerves.	4.650741903394701

If the will power is made strong , the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that I am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained.	2.6830491842723405

Around 85 % also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves.	4.241173876940514

Many medicines are available as solution to these types of problems.	4.695781720140301

They are advised to take anti-cholinergic or anti-depressant medicines.	3.7405259521337286

Problem in the outflow of urine on excessive filling of urine in urinary bladder , obstruction in passage , damage of the nervous system , consumption of antipsoric medicine or mental tension , may be the reasons of habit.	2.6413158862566557

By finding the root cause treatment should be done.	5.253323247249321

If the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting a tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery.	2.9123422964137275

Unable to keep control on urination , self leaking , feeling hasty , is a common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this.	3.49406034707566

The complication of leaking of urine on exerting pressure may occur in 20 to 40 % adult females.	3.1585734933298144

But the problem is not untreatable , women can become problem free by changing the life style , habits , doing exercise of hips and pelvis , medicine , treatment by surgery and other techniques.	2.5878621168068996

Therefore these should not hesitate , should not feel embarrassed , should lead a healthy , normal life after getting treated by taking advice from a skilled doctor.	2.581526628557451

This discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place , drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly.	2.4154449186271836

Slight dirt , showing carelessness in hygiene , wearing dirty panty repeatedly or wearing wet panty give birth to urine infection and may give discomfort of many days to the person.	2.284752764025935

Therefore , every person should stay beware of it.	5.02364725527302

ప్రత్యేకంగా/RB మహిళలుకి/N_NN వారి/PR_PRP శరీర/JJ శుభ్రతపై/N_NN ఎక్కువ/RB శ్రద్ధ/RB పెట్తవలెను/V_VM_VF ./RD_PUNC 	2.256501201167837

Those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once.	3.0119724737764884

When the menstruation stops after the age of 50-52.	6.317794898098331

After the age of 50-52 the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this , then the chance of infection increases very much.	3.1113002193084185

The distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort.	3.3509131393626035

In urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation.	4.59729584723431

The stream of urine being distorted and not straight , intense burning sensation around the place of urine , onset of fever.	2.7830856764040073

In the condition of less urination the doctor puts a urinary bladder and tube.	3.6765864958844827

The reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of E.Coli bacteria.	3.4610902829396277

Not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract , wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible.	2.624420886591296

After intercourse with husband the vaginal tract must be cleaned with water till inside so that inner cleanliness is maintained.	2.648199085990864

Light , easily digestible food , carrot , papaya , cucumber , gourd , guava etc should be eaten a lot in food so that the stomach should remain clean and there should not be any constipation.	3.6485973401260816

Lots of water should be consumed.	8.509047520334944

The cancer of skin is generally of three types.	4.910645176083419

Squamous cell cancer , basal cell cancer , melanin cell cancer.	3.855785518199721

The melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above.	4.947354778585614

While basal cell cancer is the least dangerous.	5.251531590661912

The cancer of skin generally appears in the form of a small tumor.	4.542558811356086

This tumor can appear on any part of the body.	4.3603222225544265

Like hand , leg , face etc..	6.154804739150462

The tumor can be of normal color or of black color.	3.6624520675597254

In the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake , because there is no pain in the tumor.	3.8405352000227557

Therefore , the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor.	6.139121861187773

When the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer.	3.903908727970279

Which has spread in other parts of the body as well.	4.845378440956915

The problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain.	3.246110457092648

The patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain.	5.486456371923538

The cancer of the wound increases and a stage comes when pain starts occurring in that.	3.00340205082056

But by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body.	3.1158611272565526

At times cancer appears in hairless tumors.	4.77691044758581

Therefore , do not forget any tumor.	6.253122180254774

No matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors , this is not known.	3.172865626338553

Still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms.	4.082901366664655

Formation of wound in the tumor , rapid growth of tumor , pain in the tumor , change of color in the tumor.	4.225999686576038

If any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor.	3.1932502169809496

Cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels : the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful.	2.592024321645489

Because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body.	4.465248419970058

Definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin.	3.8924090184353677

If a tumor persists for years then in the situation of the growth of the tumor , getting tested is a must.	3.737020960877884

If pain starts happening in the tumor of the skin then get cautious and definitely get the test for cancer done.	4.280255255142386

If wound appears in tumor then also getting attentive is important.	3.2988949487144485

Each such wound appearing on the skin , which does not get healed in 2 weeks , signals towards cancer.	3.7744875289895052

Generally , the cancer of skin spreads through lump vessels alone.	4.081908701953783

Therefore , generally the cancer of skin spreads very slowly indeed.	4.7329638841838975

The skin of the place which has cancer , from there it goes to the nearby lymph gland and from there it then goes to central lymph glands.	3.038235402320729

Treatment of the cancer of the skin : along with the cancerous skin the healthy skin is also cut and removed.	4.280644793871481

By which the danger of cancer being left back is removed.	4.781974387861508

At times , along with the cancer infested skin the lymph glands are also cut and removed.	3.499045262389709

It depends on the rapidity of the cancer whether cancerous gland has to be removed or not.	3.7563490789276868

Carelessness should not be towards long persisting wound , towards warts and painless tumor , towards genitals.	3.367048123745905

The cancer of the skin of the genitals is different from the cancer of the skin of the other organs.	4.519807214924822

Although the beginning of cancer starts just with a tiny tumor or wound , but the tumors and wound stay hidden beneath the skin of the genitals and by the time it is diagnosed it becomes very late.	2.814367849778235

At times this delay is also due to the hesitation in talking about the matters of genitals.	3.391120922662725

Not only cancer but other diseases of genitals also continues to grow due to hesitation and its proper treatment does not take place.	2.695251653396229

In the condition of cancer of female genitals : the skin of the genitals are cut and removed.	3.7920236023785026

If the cancer has spread up to the lymph glands then the lymph glands also have to be cut and removed.	3.6534789872407325

Some food items like fast  junk food , fried substances come under the food of negative calorie.	3.460277174495303

The hunger does get satiated by eating food items like fast  junk food.	3.5216518300122734

But the body does not get any benefit from this.	4.891040962216002

Gradually one should try to evade it by strong will power.	3.6744635833687878

Dieting is done by several girls and women to reduce their obesity and weight.	3.922528490902159

Positive results of reducing obesity come forward.	5.227283478296379

The person who is dieting should diet after taking proper consultation.	3.4404488222236

There are many dangerous diseases in the present world - TB , Malaria , disease of heart , Cancer , Tension and HIV etc..	3.069375774075579

These diseases are more dangerous than SARS , These diseases have caused the death of more people in comparison to SARS.	3.3035906704078144

Then also SARS has attracted the attention of more and more people.	3.670043355237672

There are many similarities and difficulties in SARS and other diseases.	3.1203362177734726

It is important here that SARS has emerged as a new problem , this is a new disease which is non-curable.	3.0377814142398

SARS is spreading due to infection.	6.0164746423451065

SARS today is the synonym of that disease which occurs due to corona virus.	4.141145527311165

Because of SARS disease the infected person gets high 104 degree Fahrenheit fever.	3.725642016639726

Dry cough starts coming and there is difficulty in breathing.	5.118193057209466

SARS is called hyper active respiratory syndrome.	4.780957135218056

The initial symptoms of SARS resemble pneumonia.	5.0515328286937065

But if SARS is not diagnosed in time or there is carelessness in treatment then death takes place.	3.297666905168242

The history of SARS is not very old.	4.703696887272703

The recognition of the disease was done for the first time in China.	5.295471188521067

The first patient was discovered in aeroplane on February 26 , 2003.	3.7073748310307857

The infected person gets fever of 104 degree Fahrenheit or more and he also feels cold with this.	3.233097940372725

Headache and vomiting starts happening.	8.261871686364891

Breathing becomes difficult in the patient.	7.244799808442735

The symptoms like pneumonia appear.	6.865783524907718

The one who is attacked dies in three - six days.	3.7143374124137374

In the whole world there is a situation of illusion regarding the patients and the symptoms of SARS.	5.098151259576214

Thus , Suspect Case and Probable Case have been defined.	3.655499866324924

The formula to stay constantly healthy.	5.547109268900111

Uncountable types of bacteria and virus are spread in our atmosphere.	3.792728162319024

By the medium of our breath we pull in thousands of bacteria and virus with the air into our body and then also they do not have any ill effect on our body.	3.1909630517077963

At times when our immune system falls weak due to some reason then only we become infested with flu or cough-cold or any other disease or allergy.	2.9284944700342974

With food also we make several disease bearer microbes reach our body.	2.9625912583804914

Such microbes mostly die when coming in contact with the saliva of our mouth or else the acid of our stomach.	3.0686369098411523

If by any reason this does not happen in the body of any person then he is troubled by the poisoning of the food.	3.9519743978988022

How does the immune system work ?.	7.47969333052291

At first the body protects us from the external disease causing agents.	3.3718402501584475

A type of antibacterial substance continues to be produced on our skin by coming in contact of which there is destruction of various types of disease causing bacteria and microbes.	3.475250688457362

The nature protects us by other means as well.	3.594007337803897

Our mouth , nose and eyes also become the way of entry into the body for the microbes.	4.311536345962308

A layer of mucous is spread over the nasal cavity and the lungs.	3.511152453014712

The microbes which do not die immediately , they become inactive on sticking with the mucous.	3.189631064630146

There is a type of enzyme in the mucous and the tear that flows from our eyes which is called ` lysosome '.	3.210510146314203

Lysosome by breaking the wall of the cell destroys the disease causing bacteria.	4.271903024069959

The beneficial bacteria named ` lactobacillus ' staying in the intestines and genitals saves us from yeast and the other harmful microbes.	3.2836737074090743

If by any reason any antigen like the disease causing bacteria , virus , fungus , parasite or any other external substance enter in the body by penetrating the upper protective shield then the immunity action of cells and humoral begins.	2.592224977488443

The scientists believe that apart from the other parts there are three different types of cells and three other soluble proteins in the immunity system.	3.503618000796483

The cells and proteins can be seen in the blood flowing in our body.	5.066100638155427

The cells and proteins together become capable of initiating the immunity activity.	2.8814242041248033

There are three main types of cells - red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes , white blood corpuscles or leukocytes and platelets or thrombocytes that is , the cells which coagulate the blood.	2.4961821605576295

Worm - this is a common disease in children.	9.094154932834252

Objectively the worms are of several types - round worm , magnetic worm , thread worm , tape worm and other diseases of worm.	2.8363709611287624

Round worm affects children the most.	5.870184018497452

The symptoms of round worm.	7.657747609216997

Less hunger , stomach pain , mild fever , chattering of teeth , micturition in bed , cough , itching in anus and many other abnormal symptoms are of worms.	2.66471083838301

At times the round worms come together as a unit and produce obstruction in the intestines.	3.2560828121056886

Because of round worm there may be pain in the stomach and vomiting.	5.963175199522258

The hook worms get stuck to the intestine and they reduce blood there by sucking it from there.	3.2065195727271827

The eggs of round worm reach the intestines through polluted food and blood.	3.4863881545725803

The round worm become the cause of several symptoms after maturing.	4.173885943155931

The eggs of hook worms hatch on warm and wet ground and their embryos reach the thin blood vessels by penetrating the bare feet of human body.	2.2538760448324355

Tape worm reaches the body by eating contaminated meat.	5.208858501652341

Their diagnosis is possible by stool examination.	5.497367918498432

Similarly , naru is also a type of contagious disease which occurs by drinking unclean water of ponds , lakes , tanks etc..	3.455173879870082

Thus , naru disease is generally found more in rural population.	4.974736313893154

The naru worms reach the digestive system by drinking contaminated water where the naru worms come out of the Cyclopes and enter the tissues of the skin and begin to grow.	3.22860530269512

The worm generally produces a wart in that part of the body which often comes in contact with water.	4.164106654175182

In such situation the naru worm releases its larva in the water.	3.062710175816047

The symptoms occurring due to naru worms are generally seen in the lower part of the body.	3.7887937529090383

The part of the body where the worms come out , there is intense itching and then inflammation occurs and then a hole forms.	3.3106727958726894

Because of this the symptoms of high fever , headache and vomiting appear.	5.843580862548131

In order to prevent naru disease the water of tanks , lakes and ponds etc should be used only after filtering.	3.412281358681318

The diagnosis of naru disease can also be done by putting some chemical injections in bone marrow.	3.972391567924977

The disease which spread through the microbes related to water -.	3.901882378210981

In this disease several types of malaria , filaria , dengue and yellow fever etc.are included.	3.1988158695965954

The disease of malaria spreads from one person to the other through a total of four sub species of mosquitoes named plasmodium falciparum , plasmodium vivax , plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malaria.	2.3569434839491312

In the symptoms of malaria there is high fever , nausea , headache and very profuse sweating.	3.670630393416091

By affecting the pancreas and nervous system malaria becomes the reason of loss of consciousness and at times death.	3.57537307241487

Generally the mosquitoes bite at night.	5.213522935734672

The disease of filaria spreads because of the bite of mosquitoes named culecs pipians at night.	3.634894729230643

Dengue , yellow fever and other microbial infection spreads through another sub species of mosquito named andes egyptys.	2.7934733443181354

In the chemical composing of water the roles of nitrate , fluoride and arsenic are very important in the ascertainment of the suitability of the drinking water.	2.451659665271519

But its high density may lead to the growth of various lethal diseases in the ling run.	3.5912465520988763

Or it enters our body through the medium of water and then it gets converted to nitrite.	4.645375536879576

This nitrite again reacts with diamine , amide and carbonate and forms n-nitroso compound which is very cancerous.	2.413449735474166

For the ascertainment of the suitability of fluoride rich drinks the role of fluoride is also very important.	3.2406855041341487

On consumption of long term or excessive fluoride rich water , many types of disease occur in man and cattle.	3.313969594615275

The disease occurring due to the excessiveness of fluoride is called ` fluorosis '.	4.678653309089816

Polio eradication program : problem and solution.	5.492697925207017

Polio is such a disease which is not lethal but by making the people handicapped it makes them abnormal for the entire life.	3.853095044786551

In this disease affecting in childhood generally , the growth of legs stop and they are left small and thin.	3.216201541966859

Consequently polio infested person has to walk as a lame person or with the help of crutches for the whole life.	3.0283746578261996

Often the patients of polio become fat when the age increases because of which their problems increase even further.	4.1561442150500145

The reason of polio disease is polio mellitus virus.	4.676463031252762

In order to free India from polio mellitus virus and to save people from becoming victims of polio in thousands of number every year , the pulse polio program was started by the World Health Organisation which was established in April 7 1948.	2.3852646945002878

The pulse polio program was started on an experimental basis for the first time in Delhi in 1994-95.	3.019214082223534

Being encouraged of the reach of pulse polio and the support received to the pulse polio in Delhi this program was executed in the whole country in 1995-96.	2.9571173407010223

Till now there have been several rounds of pulse polio program in the whole country.	3.7167521586704657

The main aim of pulse polio has been only this that no child should be left devoid of taking polio vaccine in hilly places , desert places , forest areas or in any far distanced places.	2.45882957432586

The pulse polio program will continue for three more years now.	3.460937771879444

As a result of the comprehensive mission for the eradication of polio in 1998 the number of new cases in the whole country has only been 1934.	3.066229493530451

Even after that because of the continuing pulse polio program the number of new cases in 1999 came down to 1126.	3.7944480515637435

In 2000 this number had reached to 265 and by October 2001 only 100 new cases came within the grasp of polio.	2.429793186919428

At the same time in 2001 there were only six such states where new cases of polio were witnessed.	2.524442911140633

Out of these more in Uttar Pradesh 82 cases and after that 13 cases in Bihar had come forward.	3.0772808316955538

The government had organised the pulse polio vaccination day only twice in 2001 but due to the increase of the number of polio cases to 1630 now the polio vaccination is being done 6 times.	3.2507430447069128

Till May 10th , 2003 whatever cases were registered for polio in the whole country , the maximum 24 out of them were found Uttar Pradesh and 23 were found in Bengal.	2.7252341100323574

Apart from these 8 in Bihar , 7 in Madhya Pradesh , 4 in Rajasthan and 3 in Delhi are included.	2.576269647171486

By August 21 , 2004 a total of 34 cases had come forward in the country , out of which 20 were of Uttar Pradesh , 7 of Bihar , 2 of Maharashtra and one case each of Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Delhi , Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.	2.2943485906229206

The government had aimed to eradicate polio from the country by 2007.	3.1102363512697297

On September 6 , 2007 a case of 11 month old girl has come forward in Jabalpur.	3.280668053448774

There has been increase in the type of P3 polio and P1 type of polio has also not been destroyed from the roots.	2.887035482329574

In 2007 1,389 cases were registered in the whole world out of which 864 cases were found in India.	4.231606119560422

It is known that because of the increase of the cases of polio in India , it has to face criticism from those countries of the world who have eradicated the disease of polio within them.	3.771701812202331

According to the Ministry of the Centre for Family Welfare the virus of polio has now become limited to some selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.	2.3325920937682083

Because the virus of polio is found only in the body of human beings its complete eradication is possible.	4.155588019730486

For this in order to ascertain the abundance of substances antibody to fight against polio in human body dose of two drops of sobin vaccine is given through mouth and the dose of Salk vaccine is given through injection under polio immunity vaccine.	2.3869517549315247

India is a country of huge population.	5.5554992606697695

70 percent population of the country stays in rural areas where the health services present are of extremely low standard.	3.147840452614297

This is the reason that the infant mortality rate is very high in India.	4.088251175386861

Although the reasons for infant mortality are various and different.	3.8134858042153317

Pulse Polio Mission is a national health safety child mission under the Family Welfare department of Indian Government in which in order to keep children of less than 5 years polio free medicine is made to drink free of cost.	2.5944156952493684

The main purpose of pulse polio mission is to make the children free from physical handicap.	3.450340479774403

The main base of this mission is to make the pulse polio mission reach to every house and giving the medicine vaccine to each child up to 5 years.	2.7348437006594915

For which the Indian government makes the mass aware through the medium of advertisement.	3.735958634703469

Pulse Polio Mission is actually a team work in which there is equal contribution of each member.	3.3137423908614703

According to the survey of the World Health Organisation more than 15 crore people fall ill due to malaria every year and more than 50 lac patients die.	2.538114101313984

Malaria epidemic is a contagious disease.	5.466198985627303

Malaria spreads from mosquito named female anopheles.	4.758802954622035

Mosquitoes are omnipresent and diseases like dengue , chickengunia and filaria eliphantiasis also occur from these.	2.9506574408934223

In malaria disease fever comes following chills and also following sweating.	3.137320832543248

10 -14 days after the biting of the mosquito the symptoms become visible and the person falls sick.	3.3462162532407285

Because of being an infectious disease it can also occur from one person to the other person.	3.846910026316624

Apart from chill there is also vomiting in malaria.	4.851603028523705

There is intense headache in malaria.	5.365927597558386

The patient may even die if the treatment is not done immediately , because by this the fever rises up to 106 degree Fahrenheit.	3.4875882704890704

After the infection there is lack of blood in the body of the person and the liver and spleen grow large.	4.396911483470325

Abortion may also occur in pregnant women due to malaria.	5.941039475385193

Female anopheles mosquito lays its eggs in stagnant water like ponds , lakes , wells , rivers , drains etc..	2.4858110234421087

These eggs are very small and they keep floating on the surface of the water.	3.6917992856561175

Generally , the eggs and the larva which come out of the eggs thereafter get a place to hide behind the grass or the plants by the side of water.	2.597987512836064

Larva comes out of the egg in 24-28 hours of the laying of eggs.	4.569173870440537

Larva gets converted to pupa in 5-6 days , which start taking dips in water.	3.0121167764980266

In 2 or 3 days it flies away becoming an adult mosquito from pupa.	2.9441706229514812

Adult mosquito rests at 45 degree angle from the surface.	4.0074589787074455

This way while becoming mosquitoes from egg their enemy is gambusia fish which eats their eggs in the state of larva , pupa.	2.345585396386757

Tank kept open on the terrace near the house , useless thrown tyres , cooler , kitchen garden , fountains for decoration , pots and vases , broken vessels , uncovered vessels , disposable glasses , stagnant water near hand pump or tap , wells which are not brought into use , cistern of animals , the stagnant water in the paddy fields , the accumulated watering the monsoon season in the tantrum of the trees , the lakes surrounded with grass , marshy land and the stagnant water of the drains are the shelter place of the mosquitoes.	1.9308534294713922

Malaria is an omnipresent problem.	6.970267962833959

There is no permanent solution to malaria and neither have the doctors of the world discovered its any inoculation.	2.800869764651917

Still for safety against mosquitoes you may get mosquito proof nets fixed on the windows and doors of your house.	2.4509695204234863

Certainly put mosquito net while sleeping at night.	4.301111881896076

Put the repellent cream on the uncovered parts of the body.	3.7980914981811327

In the evening burn the smoke of the leaves of need or the incense stick which drives the mosquito away.	2.6732793477561914

Wear such clothes on body by which the whole body remains covered.	5.687614159598713

Least number of mosquitoes will bite by this.	4.560400437621524

In order to stop the breeding of mosquitoes do not let the water accumulate near the house , change the water of the cooler every week.	2.896788437038924

Do not let water accumulate in the broken vessels kept on the terrace.	3.6337946130353873

Certainly put Gambusia fish in ponds , wells and lakes.	3.5109437947033246

At the onset of malaria fever get the patient 's blood tested.	4.43532563585698

High blood pressure is dangerous for health -.	7.217089089795374

Blood pressure is not such an illness that can not be controlled.	4.601301336205696

By adopting a course of abstinence and medicines it is possible to prevent the serious consequences of blood pressure.	3.174137826047463

Blood pumped from left chamber of the heart circulates in the arteries spread throughout the body and it is the very pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries by blood circulation which is called blood pressure.	3.89219194302514

The pressure generating in the systolic shrinking stage of heart is called systolic blood pressure and the pressure generating in the diastolic expanding stage of the heart , diastolic blood pressure.	2.9842600711157377

The systolic blood pressure in a normal person is less than 140 m.m.and the diastolic blood pressure is less than 90 m.m.of mercury.	3.6879689725852853

Blood pressure of a normal man should be less than 140  90.	5.26928883332974

We call it increasing situation of systolic blood pressure on systolic blood pressure going above 140 m.m.mercury and increasing situation of diastolic blood pressure on it going above 90 m.m.mercury.	2.534732635099393

In any person either of the two blood pressures the systolic or diastolic can mount up or both the blood pressures can increase together.	2.362668804086118

These are all named high blood pressure.	5.09054760215412

For the health of a person it is necessary for his blood pressure to be normal.	5.021287044917783

There is pressure on heart as blood pressure mounts up and also there is adverse effect of it on the different parts of body.	3.3735324990052136

Whenever there is decrease or increase in the pumping capacity of heart , there is a defect in valve of the heart , blockage in the main arteries emerging from the heart or vessels have contracted in the whole artery system and blood circulation is abnormal , then blood pressure starts mounting up.	3.147121335788715

Hormones oozing from some special endocrinal glands in the body also play an important role in the blood pressure increase.	4.751135380556213

Blood pressure also increases in case of disease in kidneys or their veins.	4.986504702194592

Such blood pressures are called renal blood pressure.	4.257210229515611

Though blood pressure can occur to anyone in any stage - children , youth , middle aged or aged , but generally disease of high blood pressure occurs more in individuals above 40 years of age.	2.6993786723720827

In the last 2-3 decades changes brought about in lifestyle , food habits , a stressful lifestyle and a luxurious lifestyle which is increasingly becoming so on a daily basis have played an important role in increasing high blood pressure.	2.156025581865714

Get these tests done in case of high blood pressure.	5.885278974431602

The general test of blood and urine.	7.430633011872433

Test of lipid profile.	9.286079455369867

The test of blood urea and creatinine.	5.341486196575403

Test of blood sugar.	12.64507423764836

Test of serum protein.	9.250236494902087

Test of E.C.G.and heart.	5.836171166657892

Diet of high blood pressure patients :.	9.655418359944758

Patients of high blood pressure should never use alcohol , cigarettes , tobacco , paan masalas.	3.4790359036520324

Patients of high blood pressure should use less salt in eatables.	4.203082388216731

Patients of high blood pressure should not use much fat in food.	4.67285741463557

For patients of high blood pressure mustard oil is a good option.	5.878053558692736

Patients of high blood pressure should consume fibrous eatables and green vegetables more in their food.	3.3485262665834363

Instead of tensed , hectic , and tiring lifestyle patient of high blood pressure should adopt satisfactory system and must complete night sleep of 6 - 8 hours regularly.	2.4885011628157985

Patients of high blood pressure should do light exercise on a regular basis or should develop a habit of strolling and walking for 30-40 minutes in the pure environment of morning.	2.70844574526821

A collective feeling emerges in the patients of high blood pressure by contributing in the small domestic chores and the need for labor also gets fulfilled.	3.0024275511327487

Medicines for high blood pressure :.	7.603942325243765

In the modern medical world best of the best medicines of high blood pressure are available but their use should be done with advice of the doctor.	3.1562289308496334

Medicines of high blood pressure should be decreased - increased or stopped with the advice of an expert only.	3.7195880328797704

On being afflicted with diabetes the amount of glucose in blood increases more than necessary.	4.944979903516613

In case of natural activity of insulin formation being closed in the body of the diseased person or the effect of its activity not occurring on the cells , parts of the body and tissues can not use glucose easily.	2.915229475149944

Entry of glucose is facilitated in the cells of human body through insulin and cells can use this glucose for energy and this glucose is made in the pancreas situated in the stomach.	3.0775731765948335

Circulation of glucose in blood happens through the liver by which tissues like brain , muscles and fat are discharged.	2.935331930520595

Prostrate enlargement , a common problem of the middle aged -.	6.570052969727224

In people above the age of 50 years problem of B.P.H.is a common case.	4.508064268556207

For the treatment of B.P.H., in a new method of surgery T.U.R.P., neither a cut is needed to be made in the stomach nor does the patient has to stay in hospital for many days.	3.5810577952238307

Prostrate gland made of muscles has a composition exactly like that of the shape of a shirt and surrounds the urinary passage like a collar.	3.016977190000275

In the prostrate gland milk like white fluid substance is made which is carrier of sperms.	2.8588618646692185

With increase in age itself the size of prostrate gland also starts increasing.	4.162899893135948

The increased state of the prostrate gland is called B.P.H.	4.403886291409384

Although it is a natural condition of increasing age it is still a disease , which can affect our life and with which physical and mental problems both can happen to the patient.	3.440891634046596

In B.P.H.disease repeated urge to urinate is a common symptom so its reason is that prostrate gland is very close to the urinary bladder and stays surrounding the urinary passage.	3.129446255045695

When size of prostrate gland increases , its pressure is also exerted on the urinary passage due to which urinary passage contracts and becomes thin and small.	3.219286114921248

As a result , urine is able to come out easily and patient starts facing problems while urination.	3.570808824322994

Symptoms of B.P.H.disease :.	6.049298766357673

Because of swelling in prostrate gland and its increase in size two kinds of problems happen in urination.	3.2553322286533874

One , difficulty to urinate due to pressure in the line of flow of urine and second , due to contraction in urinary passage and accumulation of urine an infection happens in it.	2.6461721910532487

After that there is swelling in the wall of the urinary bladder.	6.646571329097319

Due to these complications a variety of difficulties start happening to the patient.	3.420621730456206

Like repeated urge to defecate urine , urge to urinate at night , effort while urinating at start and not only this urinating drop by drop and having pain while urinating.	2.455812172288554

The complaint of pain occurs when there is infection in urine.	5.248373570368626

Because of this complaint of stoppage of urine also occurs and relief is felt only when rubber tube is applied to take out urine.	2.8200957733918073

In this type of patient there is difficulty to completely empty the bag of urine and after urinating also some amount of urine remains in the bag.	3.1727807315532104

Treatment of B.P.H.disease :.	6.00798076735849

If much enlargement has not happened in the size of the prostrate then to do the treatment neither medicine is needed nor surgery.	3.0848670227638406

In B.P.H.advice of drinking less water while sleeping at night is given.	3.588987629864458

Not only this , patient is also given advice to leave tea , coffee , etc..	3.976226812961425

If after this also the patient does n't get relief then medicine is given to reduce action of muscles of prostrate gland.	3.898367483131674

T.U.R.P : New method of surgery.	5.491921048530753

Nowadays treatment of prostrate is being done by many new methods whose names are , T.U.V.P., T.U.I.P.And T.U.R.P.	2.5926036997244832

T.U.V.P., T.U.I.P.and T.U.R.P.there is no similarity in results in treatment through all three , that is why all are not popular together in these.	2.5862093525779697

Nowadays T.U.V.P are not in use.	4.261091166042184

On the other hand treatment of prostrate through the use of laser beams is being considered the first choice of therapists.	3.1022687711524592

In the treatment of prostrate T.U.R.P is quite popular and most urologists are using this method.	3.345710899725363

This is the reason that T.U.R.P.is called gold standard procedure.	3.078781182517631

After 72 hours discharge is given to the patient and only after a rest of 2-3 days patient can do his daily work.	3.5685049162589237

In T.U.R.P method a telescope is made to enter through the urinary passage , and prostrate is seen through the help of a light and lens attached to it.	2.9857422125627906

In T.U.R.P.method telescope stays attached to a video system.	3.1365663933987373

There are many advantages of surgery by T.U.R.P.Method.	3.157443862347311

In surgery by T.U.R.P.method patient is given discharge from the hospital after 24 to 72 hours.	2.808419730362147

In surgery by T.U.R.P.method , necessity of making a cut in the stomach of patient is not needed.	3.7081924990263064

In surgery by T.U.R.P method because of less time of the patient 's staying admitted chances of infection become quite reduced.	3.1312522627901616

During surgery by T.U.R.P method there is less bleeding.	4.184248982812605

In surgery by T.U.R.P method patient recovers after only 2 to 3 days.	2.5827750790055606

On treatment of prostrate by T.U.R.P.method , after a few days there is a complaint of clot of blood coming in urine of patient many times.	3.5379412596566517

The complaint of appearance of clot of blood is a common problem which can be seen in a surgery of this kind.	4.649296706191012

This happens due to rupture of small blood vessels during surgery.	3.6573610051913863

Secretion increases on blood pressure increasing extremely , getting a fit of cough or in a state of excessive infection.	3.4117117994296056

If there is a mistake in detection of disease because of some reason then after later on it is prostrate cancer and its surgery is done.	3.2355125373786193

In such a situation the part of place of surgery becomes stiff like stone.	3.339111483700064

The turning of the part of place of surgery becoming stiff like stone occurs because of cancer having spread reaching into the third stage.	3.055928815688227

When the growth of cancer reaches the fourth stage then it also takes the bones in its embrace.	3.2713217753054256

The other problem of this surgery is that of the flow of urine becoming reduced.	4.771444414237644

To get rid of this problem therapist puts a rubber tube in the urinary passage of the patient that helps urinate.	3.75688236574221

Due to this sound of whistle starts coming from chest.	3.861188516905406

Due to swelling in the mucous membrane of breathing tubes and increase in secretion of its glands problems like cough and phlegm also happen.	3.125957348116359

Due to contraction of breathing tubes in children during asthma , they have more distress as compared to elders.	3.2685199449685007

After this gradually start giving fruit , vegetables first and then grains.	3.3404727835616845

In children brought up drinking mother 's milk chances of allergy are less as compared to cow milk drinking children.	3.100890960065952

Make the small children lie down on soft , cotton bed sheets and cover them.	3.291477368717746

Keep oneself from too much athletics or running around.	3.724560413665509

Do not be careless in treatment of spine tumor.	4.753500973081233

In human body other body parts are attached to the spine in such a way that it can move body around according to its own convenience.	3.261404195677402

All daily jobs done by humans are effected by ` spinal cord ' situated in body.	2.7728937143705754

On this Earth most developed is the very human mind which thinks for sure but it is given consequence by ` spinal cord ' only.	2.892841613989187

In body role of spinal cord safe in the backbone is like an electric wire , like on pressing a switch bulb turns on.	2.62418484969302

but electricity reaches the bulb through the wire only.	3.837767365870923

Just like this , in getting every job finished , role of spinal cord is foremost.	3.4575846071182466

Spine happens to be the base of the whole body and rest of the bones are joined to each other like the ends of a staff.	4.027077556648786

Back bone not being straight like a staff is made of 33 vertebrae and between every two vertebrae there is a disc.	3.1789167310881608

At the posterior side of back bone there are many tiny joints.	4.119612434883733

It is these discs and joints that impart the ability to the back bone , that we can bend on all four sides.	2.704355993802546

As bones of other parts of body get worn with age , just like that back bone also gets worn.	3.3214737665986385

In many people due to the amount of water being less disc tears so there is waist pain.	4.216737156084126

This pain can go from the neck towards the hand or the waist towards the foot.	3.7430829896749755

Now treatment of tumor in spine has been considered very hard but today due to a lot of techniques it has become easy.	3.8176775850838696

In spine tumor most common are those tumors in which cancer is in some other part of the body and tumor has occurred in the bone.	3.3342100700579524

In this prostrate cancer is also included.	6.063049353140036

It is called metastasis.	8.959806745204212

In our country most of the spine tumor patients are of this category.	4.599895765104722

In spine tumor other than backache there is danger of paralysis in legs due to pressure on nerves.	3.1525104875535894

Other than tumor of spine there can be tumor in spinal cord.	3.9804239617309194

The unique thing about this tumor is that it can occur at any age.	3.828947359420818

In treatment of this , other than removing the bone , as soon as treatment from chemotherapy and radiotherapy is possible it is good.	3.4005316531338

Because at a later stage patient does not get any benefit from it.	4.19766068021986

Treatment of spinal cord is only surgery.	6.5725895930596

The direct relation of back ache is with back bone.	4.003661368741992

According to ` Spine Society of India ' 10 to 15 crore people above 30 years of age are patients of backache.	3.268394251135907

To escape from backache however modern technique of operation is available in country but there is no better treatment than precaution.	3.252643194742372

In our spine between every two vertebra there is a thin , flexible membrane or cushion which is called an inter-vertebra disc.	3.3059744786853917

By this flexibility comes in spine and it works like a spring.	3.4224444260093305

Many times due to imbalance in muscles else by suddenly picking up weight or by suddenly bending the body , the part in the inner side of the intervertebral disc which is very soft , by shifting , comes towards the hole between two vertebrae.	2.51644045746172

By this pressure is exerted on the nerves there and pain is felt anywhere from waist to leg.	3.2423925346208655

Tingling and weakness is felt in legs.	6.387523728204665

Nowadays for treatment of slip disc , surgery like spinal endoscopy has become possible.	3.5386927495134146

Firstly it is important to know what is the cause behind slip disc.	5.022861343706597

If by working too much backache or waist pain is occurring then it will get better by resting.	3.0239082123359218

Do not keep body in tension.	6.302016992195336

Do not pick up too much weight , prevent constipation.	4.251668558248922

Diseases of thoracic spine and VAT surgery -.	4.5707343394621045

Nowadays due to increasing use of computer eruption of pain in neck is increasing fast.	3.8138665809214447

In big cities of India and in metropolitan cities , in the face of increasing use of computer there is a rapid increase in number of people afflicted with waist pain.	3.2865076753200735

From children to aged everyone can be affected by waist pain.	3.3564465145179256

Increasing age , heavy physical work , people working in the same condition for a long time like secretary , receptionist , workers of call center , people who pick up heavy loads get affected more.	2.49851436173063

If it is the case of it 's treatment then several kinds of treatments are also present :.	4.2035515624747255

Bed rest , injection , surgical treatment , spinal fusion , disc transplant , vertebroplasty , pinhole surgery and minimum invasive surgery , etc..	2.297863109658346

Now the beginning of a new surgery has been done and it is , VAT surgery Video Assisted Thoracoscopy.	4.252377530992854

Today diseases related to backbone have increased a lot.	4.970273287402997

Till now surgery of thoracoscopic spine which happens to be behind the chest is very difficult and excruciating.	3.525989908118917

For this the surgery was possible only by cutting the ribs and by removing the heart and lungs to one side , the side effects of which used to be very serious.	3.3882786688063664

But now by VAT surgery it has become possible to treat these diseases very easily by cutting and ripping.	2.880608879613802

In thoracic spine like neck and waist all diseases are possible , like slip disc , tumor , infection like T.B., fracture , hunchback , etc.	2.2076763494789264

This pain can sometimes go down to the legs.	4.171147690343221

With this it can produce numbness in legs , difficulty in walking and in daily activities.	3.267796653657918

The cause behind all these difficulties is pressure on nerves.	3.7386216589688415

By this the distortion of waist in patients of hunchback can be removed easily.	3.8445962584676328

The benefits of VAT surgery :.	6.830124247105196

In VAT surgery all those surgeries are possible through a thin telescope by reaching the backbone while watching on a TV screen , which were possible before on cutting open the chest.	2.057612295420094

The whole VAT surgery gets over in only 1-2 hours.	3.801518501082627

The main advantage of VAT is that patient can start walking around from next day , there is no risk of bleeding or infection and patient gets a discharge from the hospital in 3 days.	2.914896606695052

With this , for patients of hunchback , deformation of waist can be easily reduced.	3.872225015219155

Cancer of gall bladder can be fatal.	5.890006992933807

In cancer of gall bladder there is no pain from the start.	5.520109331844138

Gall bladder closes because of cancer.	5.967163786652778

Because of which jaundice can happen to the patient in the last stage of his life.	4.869015426825755

So that the patient does not face much trouble in last stage.	4.6435740279227025

It would be better that the patient is admitted to such a hospital where there are better stomach disease experts so that the anguish of patient is reduced at the end of his life.	3.326839266061669

Cancer of gall bladder , on increasing , spreads even to the lymph node of stomach then this is also not possible that it be cut and removed from body via surgery.	3.06977744352803

Cancer spreading to the lymph node means that the chances of the patient recovering fully becomes 0 %.	4.576078599279078

Why do lymph nodes enlarge in stomach ? 	4.892615481920159

Ordinarily lymph nodes are found in the stomach of all individuals but when they increase inside the stomach then there are many reasons behind their enlargement.	4.293936442509621

These lymph nodes of stomach enlarge due to T.B.disease also.	3.2572989679525026

Their own cancer in lymph nodes which is called Lymphoma , because of that also they can enlarge.	3.367970020306513

Other than lymph node one more cancer is also there which is called Hodgkin 's disease , or in some other part of body if cancer is occurring then lymph nodes enlarge in the stomach.	2.9623398959319767

Cancer of stomach and cancer of gall bladder mostly spread in the lymph nodes of stomach only.	4.238666642274806

If in the gall bladder there is some ordinary common defect then it is removed out of the body.	4.171471946333771

Patient can lead a normal life but if cancer is in its first stage.	4.061141042755387

If cancer on increasing reaches the lymph nodes then it is a late stage of cancer , and in this attempts can also be made to save the patient.	3.940462406306068

Cancer is surely a horrible disease , but if detected in time then this disease can be cured too.	4.359327078979944

Therefore after 30 years , 35 years and 40 years of age every person should certainly get a medical examination of all his body parts done once.	3.241979992791556

There was a time when people were told the reason behind ceaseless pain happening in their pelvic region to be imaginary or depression related.	2.359839119153721

But after investigation , this problem has been spotted in the nature of I.C.	3.430803252139013

In cases related to I.C., the thing which therapists find most challenging is this - ignorance of the reasons behind the disease and absence of a characteristic diagnostic test.	2.5010897554724627

The disease of Interstitial Cystitis is often misdiagnosed with urinary tract infection.	3.1131776629104624

There is an urgency for urination.	5.042574072554909

The cause behind I.C.disease is still unknown.	3.745514866685618

Some researchers have recently found out a factor , anti proliferative factor APF.	3.156202486235974

which is only found in urine of women during I.C.	4.852432944977618

The thing that needs to be noted is that for effect to take place in the therapy related to this disease , it takes time and for this it is a necessity for the patient to have endurance.	3.554909788451405

Xerophthalmia occurs due to these reasons.	9.597527479465896

Xerophthalmia occurs due to the reduced consumption of less food rich in Vitamin A everyday.	4.121827398529328

Xerophthalmia occurs due to the error in transmission of the absorbed retinol to the right place in the body and the fast depletion of the accumulated Vitamin in the body.	3.5368482321977734

The deficiency of food materials rich in Vitamin , the reduction of the quantity of Vitamin A accumulated in the body are the chief causes of xerophthalmia.	3.972572507651117

Because of the deficiency of Vitamin a the power of the body to fight with the infections is reduced.	4.113313733061251

Due to infection the health of the child goes on deteriorating.	5.580498316316122

Eye related signals and symptoms -.	7.4763488133741145

Although the deficiency of Vitamin A affects many organs but its worst effect is seen on the eyes because of which eye sight is constantly lost.	3.791292273818889

The surface of the cornea becomes dry and rough which later on ruptures partially or completely.	3.463652667955665

Wound develops because of this in the cornea.	7.848740105805316

The damage to eyes is such due to the wound in the cornea that it is permanent , that is , it can never become alright.	3.833183833087043

The eye sight goes by this.	5.791264348840847

Eye related symptoms are the most trustworthy measure to identify the deficiency of Vitamin A.	3.855657250954189

In the serious condition of disease the grave symptoms may become visible early.	3.6255698322225083

It is not essential that mild symptoms before order and grave symptoms later on are visible.	2.545561632444771

The detection of the signs and symptoms of xerophthalmia.	4.6635686885988665

Night blindness : the first symptom of xerophthalmia.	5.193218424634955

In night blindness the child can not see after darkness or things kept near him in the room.	3.1536862009282878

Bitata stains - although there could be difference in the shape , place and design of the bitata stains but they are similar in appearance.	2.9371164311421603

Bitata stains are formed due to the accumulation of frothy substance on conjunctiva.	4.456215285155454

If disease of keratomalacia is not treated then cornea at the place of wound may get permanently damaged.	3.4674735734787747

Due to keratomalacia a hole may occur in the cornea.	4.579410089042111

In the condition of hole in cornea the damage would never be corrected.	3.1282061065662474

The sooner the treatment of keratomalacia is done the smaller would be the wound and the damage of cornea.	4.0597834554093835

If the treatment is done fast then the damage of the cornea and the blindness occurring due to it can be completely prevented.	3.8523540296929917

India was the first country which had implemented a national level program to prevent blindness occurring in children of less than 5 years due to the deficiency of Vitamin A.	3.031239516793745

Initially the prevention program was started in those seven states where the problem was more serious.	3.1204176938710146

By 1975 the disease prevention program was implemented in the entire country in the form of a national program.	4.09208960056102

At present the national disease prevention program is being run amidst 3 crore children less than 5 years of age.	2.8859223828926246

The help of two principles is being taken in implementation of the national disease prevention program.	3.1852671936558465

In the short term principle heavy dose of Vitamin A is given time to time to children less than 5 years of age.	3.1501444978819193

The danger of blindness due to the deficiency of Vitamin A is the maximum in the children less than five years of age.	4.215489531549615

At first the age of pre school children 1 to 5 years was included in this program.	4.142444130636296

Now by giving an extension to this program children of 6 - 11 months are also being included.	3.0878951987621286

Together with this there is the proposal to give priority to children from 6 months to 3 years.	3.9037663290195774

Giving extra dose of Vitamin A in addition from time to time is effective and safe.	3.7658553642116552

On giving the dose of Vitamin A in limited quantity its ill effects are negligible.	3.968737556261282

At times the effects of headache and vomiting are seen but they are seldom and common.	3.6569553884901667

The prevention of blindness occurring due to deficiency of Vitamin A -.	4.622792148903737

The decided dose of Vitamin A is as follows -.	5.32981359853347

Children of 6-11 months : giving the dose 1,00,000 I.U.	4.782423336684842

The time of the inoculation of measles is a good time to give the dose of Vitamin A.	4.190042007709389

Children of 1-5 years : The dose of 2,00,000 IU every 6 months.	4.426719670552258

The treatment of children affected with the deficiency of Vitamin A.	4.768328880006275

On the identification of deficiency of Vitamin A all children affected with this must be immediately given the dose of 2,00,000 IU of Vitamin A.	3.2724398849866554

One to four weeks after this second dose of 2,00,000 I.U.of Vitamin A should be given.	3.9452283148347016

In order to avoid the occurrence of the deficiency of Vitamin A again the regular intake of Vitamin A rich food items like green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables of yellow pulp should be encouraged.	3.452798789948756

Children who are suffering from dysentery , intense respiratory infection , an eye must be kept carefully on them.	3.153954582210026

Such children must be administered the normal dose of Vitamin A.	3.9397658454455797

For the national program the solution of Vitamin A comes in the form of a fragrant syrup in bottle of 100 millilitre.	4.205671881200078

Vitamin A syrup is obtained from the ministry of health and family welfare.	4.115849870420405

On the basis of the probable number of the beneficiaries the children from 6 months to 5 years of age the medical officer of the primary health center should put a demand for the required quantity of Vitamin A.	2.678360174742877

The maternal and child health department of health and family welfare department is that central department which has the complete responsibility of the implementation of program.	2.7399829868910914

The program is implemented by the primary health center and sub center in the rural areas under the guidance of medical officers.	2.894848769645544

The medical officer of the primary health center is in charge of getting Vitamin A , administering dose of Vitamin A to children and guiding the program.	2.787385028550351

The responsibility of administering dose to children in primary health centres is on assistant health nurses ANM and on other paramedical workers.	2.608411707232694

Comprehensive immunity inoculation program provides an opportunity of coming in contact with the newborn babies.	3.330889012883229

The contact happening with the newborn babies of 9 - 12 months for the inoculation of measles is the best time for giving the first dose of Vitamin A 1,00,000 IU.	3.105995621711712

Intensive Children Development Service ICDS program provides opportunity to give Vitamin A to children of 6 months to 5 years of age.	2.9436013751497097

Not only should Aanganbari workers help in identifying needy children but they should also help in administering Vitamin A dose and health education to areas where ICDS program is running.	2.166186201752715

By his fifth birthday the child should get nine doses of Vitamin A in total.	3.620359700657795

Under the ICDS program vigilance is kept on all the children of up to 6 years so that the use of their growth vigilance card is behavioural.	3.5133122719806074

Lack of Vitamin A in food and lack of accumulated Vitamin A in the body are chief reasons of xerophthalmia.	4.659558117296818

In children of pre - school age lack of Vitamin A and carotene the initial form of Vitamin A in the daily diet is the chief reason of tension.	3.4539696732453775

The amount of Vitamin A and carotene in the diet of children have been found less than half of the daily proposed quantity of 400 gram retinol or 1600 microgram of beta - carotene.	3.0319480715264526

The absorption of Vitamin A decreases in children suffering from dysentery , breathing infections , stomach related diseases , measles and other diseases.	3.07180218611797

In the lack and prevention of Vitamin A help may be got in the control and prevention of malnutrition through immunity , proper nutrition , oral rehydration and timely treatment.	2.6799447791726

The last resort in the prevention of the lack of Vitamin A is the regular consumption of Food items rich with Vitamin A.	3.3436583533689705

The food items rich with Vitamin A Are cheap as well as locally available.	3.3812156478829762

The getting of Vitamin A should be ascertained right from the time of birth.	5.053482995399496

Along with the feeding of colostrum or milk the milk that is secreted from the mother ' s breast immediately after the birth of child the need of Vitamin A would be fulfilled during the first six months of breast feeding of the child.	3.0235188573432765

Between the age of four to six months initiating giving abundantly Vitamin A rich food is very essential.	4.036968290398625

The food items included in this are green leafy vegetables and fruits and vegetables consisting of yellow pulp carrot , Capsicum , gourd , papaya , mango and sweet potato.	2.9479697381849967

The quantity of Vitamin A received from 100 grams of edible part in maximum green leafy vegetables is more than the daily received dose of Vitamin A prescribed for the diet of Indian children.	3.115219404003842

After cooking this much of vegetable is reduced to only two tablespoonful.	3.420329394398609

Along with the other food items a child can eat this much of vegetable easily.	3.740032276562521

This way he can easily fulfil his daily need of Vitamin A.	3.3148724754679337

The inclusion of other food items rich in Vitamin A apart from green leafy vegetables like dairy products milk , cheese , curd , butter liver , eggs , ghee and oil should also be encouraged.	2.5626744334314155

Such habits related to diet put a stop on the lack of Vitamin A.	3.6631668569181945

The consumption of green leafy vegetables and other food items rich with vitamin A everyday during pregnancy and breast feeding is advised.	3.133978834640318

Because of the state of Vitamin A in the body of the mother the quantity of Vitamin A in the mother ' s milk and by that the health of the child is affected.	4.906046999968898

Because of the consumption of food materials rich in vitamin A in abundant quantity during pregnancy and breast feeding there is never a lack of Vitamin A in both mother and child.	3.19747274051204

Nutrition education is an integral part of primary health services and ICDS program and under this emphasis must be given on the encouragement of the use of food items highly rich in Vitamin A.	2.785238022672148

The ultimate solution to the problem is implicit in providing education of eating food items rich in Vitamin A to people.	3.4320230061597656

The consumption of regular and sufficient quantity of Vitamin A in the children of preschool age and pregnant and breast feeding women should be ascertained.	3.375126644336728

The implementation of the national program in effective manner.	4.664551872536575

The program can be implemented effectively only with the help of trained workers and the rise of community awareness of high level.	2.783778232221947

The training must be given to the entire team providing health services and the workers of ICDS program.	3.5172542772867783

The workers of both the areas will be benefitted by this in playing their responsibility in the implementation of the program in effective manner.	2.8752095856407567

The following matters must be paid attention to while training.	3.7794651368702565

The identification of people receiving dose of Vitamin A.	4.086323544091211

Along with getting Vitamin A the treatment of lack and stopping of Vitamin A by giving heavy dose of Vitamin A.	3.9433993587284446

The encouragement of community participation.	7.039021819743314

The technique of recording and the method of reporting.	5.2705147673792965

The lack of Vitamin A is the chief health problem of the mass among the children of preschool age in India.	3.5758837249693447

According to a rough estimate 30 to 40 thousand children become victims of preventable blindness every year.	2.982884825406415

The danger of infections in children increases because of lack of Vitamin A and the chances of their falling sick and dying also possibly increases.	3.2496457578399243

The benefit received from Vitamin A complex makes the national disease prevention program stop the blindness occurring due to lack of Vitamin A very widely effective.	2.8660324547715423

The officers of health and ICDS program and the controllers of these programs can play the role effective support in saving the eye sight of crores of children and improving their life.	2.4995525300018575

Under the National Disease Prevention Programme implemented against the blindness happening due to the lack of Vitamin A 3 crore children below the age of five years are being benefitted at this time.	3.07215397986573

Under this program two chief principles are being adopted.	3.603782043264119

One is short term principle and the second is log term principle.	3.26807650921826

Under the first principle the arrangement of administering heavy dose to children between the age of 6 months and 5 years has been done.	3.3361320848531992

Under the second plan emphasis is given on getting more vitamin through the medium of vitamin A rich food materials like green leafy vegetables , yellow vegetables and fruits , regular consumption of dairy products and breastfeeding.	3.031269070147211

Encouragement is given on consumption more quantity of vitamin A rich food materials which are cheap and which are also available regionally and on educating the children because this is the last solution to stop the deficiency of Vitamin A.	3.134736292287439

The mobile phones of hospital staff become home of diseases.	3.757843348165664

The mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern life style may become the reason for the spreading of disease.	3.6579152479482175

This fact has come forward in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of MGM hospital situated in Washi here.	3.0016437926904214

More than 82 percent workers of hospitals are found to be the careers of microbes and organisms of contagious diseases in a study.	3.214088145205876

The doubt of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , pimples , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases are in this.	3.305419027475092

According to the study done by the Indian Medical Research Council the test of 120 mobile phones of the workers were done.	2.9333222168452986

The researcher final year student of MBBS of MGM medical college Dr.Nikhil Tambe has found that such organisms and microbes have been found on 99 phones , which along with making the disease of the patient serious may also become the reason of delay in his getting well.	2.5754686455587517

Tambe has said that the maximum number of presence of microbes has been found in phones of the technicians.	3.760359282770562

After this the mobile phones of ward , nurse and then doctor were infected.	3.005166109586937

The chief of the microbiology department of the hospital Dr.Chitra said that the maximum 54.6 percent stacillococcus acurus organisms have been found on the mobiles , which become the reason of skin disease.	2.7694493471091457

Apart from this the organisms like e - coli and pseudomonas have also been found because of whose infection the ill effect on the body is maximum.	3.302358393777729

In one of the studies done in Coimbatore the presence of 96.2 percent organisms was found on the phone of the hospital workers.	3.322089576858334

Sprouted cauliflower may protect from the cancer of stomach.	5.145314505007262

This fact has come up from one of the studies that by eating germinated cauliflower three days early keeps you miles away from stomach cancer , gastritis and ulcer.	2.5411562476793157

Sprouted cauliflower destroys the microbes which give rise to these diseases.	4.070998123969736

According to the published study in the General Prevention Research of the American Association for Cancer Research situated in America by eating 70 gram quantity of germinated cauliflower regularly three days before finishes the effect of the organism named helicobacter pylori H.pylori.	2.091023368668791

H.pylori microbe is the maximum reason of the diseases related to stomach and the cancer of stomach.	4.798437658953869

Jade Fahe , the research associate of the faculty of the department of medicine science of the John Hopkins School of Medicine has said that it has been found from the study that with germinated cauliflower not only in animals but in man also it is capable of stopping cancer.	2.6193442963572466

In the beginning of the study on these people the effect of these organisms was studied after four to eight weeks following it through various tests.	2.706813777865709

After eight weeks it was found less , however the effect of the microbes on the ones feeding on Alfa was fond to be the same.	2.98942446913277

New oral vaccine has been prepared for diarrhoea.	4.960897773462254

The National Institute of Disease , NICD Kolkata did test on 70 thousand people.	2.9646460668248515

The cost of the dose of oral vaccine would be 40 - 50 rupees.	3.5198253448551804

To prevent diarrhoea the chances of the oral vaccine to come early to the market has increased manifold.	3.0728009057077172

The National Institute of Intric Disease has completed the successful test on around 70 thousand people.	2.5520831200941094

70 percent cases have come positive in the test.	4.205085454711078

Although around one year of time may be required for the oral vaccine to come in the market.	4.273999801196043

The cost of the dose of the medicine may be between 40 to 50 rupees.	4.011427554491316

Despite this there was no vaccine for the treatment of diarrhoea.	5.419144520478308

But after the untiring efforts of hundreds of researchers success has been achieved in the preparation of one more vaccine.	2.4682280182717546

International Vaccine Institute Korea has manufactured this medicine.	4.105453308127268

To escape from the Indian market a national company has bought this formula.	3.061623409877783

The cost of this medicine would be one dollar per dose and any person would have to take two doses of it.	3.066548228997248

The effect of medicine will stay for two years.	5.018216657311387

In Vietnam the dose of vaccine has already been given to 90 lakh people and in Kolkata , India the trial has been done on 70 thousand people , in which the accuracy of the medicine has been found to be 70 percent.	3.105488051925522

In the program specialists from World Health Organisation , National Institute of Cholera and Intrinsic Disease Kolkata , ICMR , Department of Biotechnology of the Central Government and International Vaccine Institute Korea.	2.038457093630753

The experts have told that the first to prevent diarrhoea is oral vaccine.	3.768471985145243

Its maximum benefit would be in Orissa , West Bengal along with the people living in other coastal regions of the country and on international level Africa , Australia and people residing in the coastal areas in other countries , because the number of cases registered here is maximum.	2.3825903597144387

Though this medicine can not be administered to children who are less than one year of age.	4.168159166237334

According to the figures of World Health Organisation the total number of case registered for cholera was one lac 77 thousand in the whole world and 4 thousand 31 people died because of this.	2.4732142583446826

Because of unavailability of any vaccine to prevent this disease one has to depend only on the methods of precautions.	3.485719061417492

According to the World Health Organisation the effect of diarrhoea is seen more in coastal areas like Orissa , West Bengal , Gujarat and metropolitans like Delhi and Mumbai.	2.575968461693391

How can the diagnosis and treatment of cancer be done ? 	5.155265691425729

Many times due to less information or carelessness the diagnosis of breast cancer is done late.	3.795372862577112

If you stay a little attentive then the treatment of breast cancer is possible timely.	4.459696331202024

If tumor is felt in breasts together with growth in the arm pits then be cautious.	3.19214267573495

Mild pain and swelling is felt on that place because of the growth of tumor.	5.9173800399548

Change comes in the breasts or their size.	7.614848413097438

At times wound appears on the place of swelling and then blood secretion starts from there.	3.824624249831765

When the tumor is on the upper and outer surface of the breast and there is secretion from the breast then immediately contact the doctor in such situation.	4.257219549072793

The tumor appears hard and there is no pain in it on touching.	4.683627084390699

The women who are more than thirty years of age should certainly themselves inspect their breasts once monthly seven days after the menstruation.	2.8754454309193784

The stages of breast cancer are believed to be four.	5.008559966934596

But as the spreading of the wound increases its treatment becomes difficult.	4.0600542264372494

In the fourth stage also if its treatment is done then success is achieved in 50 percent cases.	3.6534464647505596

In the first and second stage the treatment is cent percent possible.	3.7673362540109316

In the first stage the size of the tumor is less than two centimetres.	5.3619847818978625

The tumor of two centimetres is not visible in any part of theory.	3.775292945791441

In the second stage the tumor grows to two to five centimetres big.	3.519781534271537

This reaches to the neighbouring gland of colourless fluid.	4.3007735946762775

In the third stage the tumor grows to five cm and spreads to the skin and muscles of the body but does not reach up to the neighbouring gland.	3.852641353624865

In the fourth and very dangerous stage the tumor can be of any size.	3.4723542811793537

The tumors do get affected by this and it also spreads to the other parts of the body.	4.626017213888764

As first surgery is done on the area with pain and then it is diagnosed that how big is the spread.	4.021360972383349

The conclusion may be wrong at the clinical stage but at the surgical stage the condition becomes very clear.	2.6006748924285032

After the age of forty years the women should certainly get the mammography done.	3.6332512722789088

In one mammography the expenditure comes to one thousand rupees.	3.518125568854655

Do not hesitate at all in getting mammography done.	4.386614484584336

Discuss about this , tell this to the members of the family and accumulate new information.	3.7974776909861507

The treatment of breast cancer is expensive , which comes to one lac rupees.	3.9816883040304814

But many charitable institutes are such which help immensely in this to the person.	3.3033294086320986

Many help line services are also available for the treatment of breast cancer.	4.781571278996863

the treatment of cancer depends upon the age of the patient , the shape and spreading of the tumor formed in the breast.	5.258889366600685

Maximum women have to undergo surgery following which they are advised for anti cancer drug or hormone therapy.	2.8007993220650276

After the age of forty get mammogram done regularly or else do the inspection of your breast yourself after consulting the doctor.	2.4138274413933827

Actually they get relief by sucking their thumb.	5.525677836475118

If this habit of sucking thumb does not get over even by the age of four-five years then the case becomes serious.	3.409507433562227

The thumb starts weakening and it also has bad effect on the teeth as well.	4.307339590018032

In such case many times to give correct shape to the teeth many times the braces are needed.	3.189297326298594

If the teeth are in bad shape then reduction comes in the beauty of the face , in such case dentists are the ones , who make the face beautiful by giving good shape to the teeth.	2.795507911539397

Implantologist and orthodontist play the chief role in this.	3.7040454010753288

Implant is the latest technology in India.	5.58186477554114

Generally before implanting tooth the nearby good teeth are rubbed and then new tooth is fixed.	2.5877056291060683

Some myths which disturb.	8.586939764691815

The eyesight becomes weak on the removal of the upper tooth , this myth is totally false.	3.2118208210364587

Removal of tooth has got nothing to do with sight.	3.8941080655402636

When the artificial set of teeth or denture is built for once then it comes to use for the entire lifetime.	2.851717057677562

But it is not at all like that , the tissues below the denture keep engine with time and the dentures do not fit and such dentures then do not stay hygienic , therefore the dentist advice to change it every five years.	2.4176014011036657

If the treatment of damaged tooth is done once then all the problems of teeth and gums get over , but it is not like that.	3.817534849950987

Actually the teeth become weak only when the gums and teeth are not cleaned properly.	3.617727291116672

If the scaling of the teeth is not done regularly then the gums become weak and the teeth start falling after getting rotten.	3.4850937346967665

The procedure for the treatment of teeth is painful , it is not at all like that.	4.645292887731747

The patient is given local anaesthesia due to which no matter what kind of treatment is done to the teeth there is no feeling of pain.	4.511722457341092

Very modern high drilling machines also do not vibrate much.	3.929629685277009

The pregnant women should not get the treatment of the teeth done , this myth is also baseless.	4.924816573036403

If the x-ray is not done in the initial three months of pregnancy then it would be good.	4.9185773388192615

The teeth should be massaged with finger and not brush , this is also a false belief.	3.943924358475526

A brush having good bristles removes the food particles entangled in the teeth properly.	3.019890561302776

Massaging the gums with finger after cleaning the teeth with brush is beneficial.	3.701931593728096

It is not good to clean teeth with rice , salt and tobacco powder etc.	3.5119260854396956

While the truth is that in good quality pastes there are such particles which are specially mixed for the teeth.	2.987366220484543

The arrangement of blood is a very important work.	7.848443537086218

During pregnancy there is often the deficiency of blood in women.	6.05998936290861

If any danger arises during delivery then excess blood may flow out of the body of mother.	3.982282344355783

In such situation it may be required to give her more blood.	4.254358843816146

In such time it is the moral responsibility of all the males of the household and the neighborhood to give blood.	3.4142940351199407

At least two blood donators definitely go to the hospital so that on requirement blood may be received by the pregnant woman.	3.215758351233623

Therefore you must eat these things of iron elements.	4.989934900161321

Even eat vegetables and lentils of green leaves every alternate day.	3.6469328358319593

Pregnant women should not drink tea before and after meals.	5.010902917193485

Due to the consumption of tea the use of iron elements found in food does not take place completely.	4.62835171998427

Lemon , orange , guava , raspberry and raw mango with meals increases the use of this iron element in the body.	3.1237925351919995

Eating tablets given by A.N.M.sister  Anganwadi activist is also very necessary for not letting the blood lack in body.	2.965073862450212

If the child falls sick then should consumption be stopped ? 	3.6804135149969794

If the child odes not eat then would he not become weak ? 	3.056220260151525

Therefore on child falling sick also do not stop feeding food to him.	3.693572509977032

In such condition you will have to give more attention to the child.	5.625483525738627

Now your child is growing up and his body has started growing.	3.9715553426199413

The child needs more meals , more food.	4.752301825598158

Now for child your milk only is not enough.	4.89620000045406

Now the child needs food two - three times in a day.	3.489044242319977

That too such , which the child may eat with interest.	4.955693021249781

Now the teeth of the child have not come out.	7.270651497506324

In such a situation what will you make him eat ? 	3.736112170038225

Give the child mashed things in food like mashed roti , dalia , mashed fruits and vegetables.	3.0275270567771937

Certainly use one - two spoons of oil in food.	5.203865972876695

Feed the child half bowl of food two - three times.	4.737443530263851

On the attainment of one year age of the child increase his dose.	5.652205123755512

Now instead of feeding the child two - three times a day feed him at least half bowl of food five - six times a day.	3.2882900152642347

You should not feed the child till the time he does not start eating his entire food after asking it from you on his own.	2.862279416000617

Contraceptives have given new description to women and new dimension as well.	3.259619961942601

Especially because of the contraceptive pills they got the right to take the decision on their own to give birth to the child.	4.2219908417112215

Apart from healthy and active life to women the contraceptives have also given this self confidence that they themselves have the right on their body.	2.5402058373491823

Contraceptives have helped in making life of women simple.	4.058885461391857

Now they are capable of living their life according to their own wish.	3.95420472556579

When they want children , how many children , whether they want or not , they can decide this with the help of their life partner.	2.9535255952397583

Birth of child is now not her compulsion , it is her own decision.	3.340926426121529

She has also proved to be a good mother by this.	4.755127595331415

The woman plays an important role in the betterment of own child and the entire family through less children and proper gap in the age of children and in this contraceptives help her in every step.	2.8238222294546436

The history of contraceptives is also told to be very old , despite this they got a developed form in this century only.	2.713649176625866

More important than this is that first time the identity of women got approval in the form of a human being.	3.5357700118643454

What is conception ? 	13.805161766422895

When the sperms of man meet with the ovum of woman then conception takes place.	2.951173662503532

But before this conception many situations are formed.	4.4222051204937545

Firstly the sperms reach the uterus by going through the vaginal canal and enter the fallopian tube.	2.842594749830148

Here in the broad portion of the tube there is mating with the developed eggs which comes out of the ovary.	3.5229708348795525

On entering the eggs sperms mix their chromosomes with the egg.	3.2343735677858736

The egg gets fertilized and after developing gets converted into a multicelled ball which is called blastocyst.	3.048035228286711

This gets attached to the surface of the uterus.	5.686165746588571

The contact with the muscles of the tube and the cilia lining as thin as hair advance the egg towards uterus.	3.0477984656001493

The egg does not advance on its own.	4.231860484492567

Every month many eggs are developed but in hair follicle only one egg is able to develop.	3.015810145923616

The other eggs get squeezed on their own.	4.254358808964053

Lakhs of sperms enter the uterus but maximum get destroyed due to the reason of the acidic substances inside.	3.2176751002120554

One or two out of whatever sperms escape get attached to the outer layer of the egg and the moment conception takes place , it puts a ban on the entry of other sperms.	2.651298307165646

Following situations come in conception.	6.978120381337144

Sperms passes through the uterus and goes to the fallopian tube.	5.080827347202502

The egg enters the tube.	7.126630823739088

The sperm makes the egg conceive.	5.623246152368099

The zygote gets divided into two.	5.864412255489647

64 cells of zygote enter inside the uterus.	5.013021006645767

This gets converted into a seed.	6.292917468437807

On reaching its destination the seed gets connected with the surface of the uterus.	3.5983104818517395

Here it gets nutritive substances from the blood cells of the mother.	4.446025380345553

Related to the menstrual cycle generally women have this misbelief that it is dirty blood and the more it flows out of the body the better it is.	3.6094479001869035

But this is a very wrong misbelief.	9.583172427899445

Actually the reason of menstruation is the destruction of inner wall of skin inside the uterus , that is , the endometruim line.	3.670195791995029

The thinner this wall would be , that much less would be the flow of blood.	3.829953866688651

Because of excess flow there is a deficiency of iron elements in the body of the woman and the woman becomes victim of anemia.	4.735923946736958

Actually menstrual cycle is one such physical change in the body of women which comes entirely within the system of reproduction and is very important for reproduction.	4.166810750328598

The menstruation coming every month is the time between the onset of puberty and menarche.	3.0386610222975214

During the menstrual cycle from the body of fully mature woman during ovulation ovum is released , with this the lining of uterus , endometrium develops that time only.	2.842347305591214

After ovulation this lining prepares the reproduced egg and conception takes place.	2.899345889208192

If conception does not take place then a new menstrual cycle starts.	4.121837548691917

Generally the menstrual cycle is of 28 days.	5.669405285861696

It has three phases - in first phase menstruation from 1 up to 5 days.	2.7642854247727873

In the second phase the hormone cycle from 6 up to 13 days.	3.016317815172246

The third phase suitable for reproduction 14 to 28.	4.634229368867203

Before the start of menstruation many changes in the hormones take place , whose maximum effect is seen on the behavior of the women , like the increase of irritation , some stiffness in breast , increase of weight , swelling etc.	2.923692836714382

Because of the reason of the bursting of ovarian cyst many times there is sudden pain in abdomen.	3.634144460639333

Many times blood also starts flowing heavily , the reason of occurrence of both these complications together is soreness in genitals.	3.4436767084765187

But there is no need to panic in this because these diseases become alright easily by proper treatment.	3.0671280250581425

Generally there is a misbelief that four days prior to menstruation , four days of menstruation and four days after menstruation are very safe , but this is possible only when your menstruation is regular.	2.8645680687981336

The second method is that everyday the woman takes her temperature and notes that in a diary.	2.9395726177017507

The day on which temperature rises by one degree then believe that egg has been produced this day.	2.619843245170906

Five days before and after this day are said to be unsafe.	4.410020115279548

By recording the temperature for three - four months the woman can easily get to know her unsafe days easily.	3.133581299082964

Various methods are present for contraception , you have to choose according to your ease.	4.152130002172174

Because of not using the methods of contraception children are born one after the other and by becoming victim of malnutrition go to the embraces of death.	3.228134314042697

In the entire world death of around 60 thousand children takes place , out of this 99 percent deaths occur only in developing countries.	2.675991159447545

The mother and child should stay healthy and fit and proper gap should be there between two children , for all these it is important that methods of contraception should be used.	3.138488985093376

For men condom is very cheap and is a simple option and it also saves them from many infections.	3.302166184384074

There should be knowledge of the method of its proper use.	5.07211101494689

Apart from this because of this the woman has to depend completely on the man.	4.161260393286523

After discharging instead of putting the semen in the woman ' s vagina he throws it outside.	3.232327455564634

Though it is a good and free of cost option , but because of this the danger of conception is maintained without interruption.	4.685286218688621

In the process of vasectomy also that passage is closed without incision through which the sperms flow.	3.095652258051675

What is to be understood is that only the passage is closed.	4.525154869781716

This is a small work of 15 minutes.	5.390133108714403

By coming on his own the person can go back home on his own.	3.573818223084459

After vasectomy he can do his daily work as usual.	3.8557496852692403

In vasectomy one precaution has to be taken , for the next three months while doing intercourse condom has to be used.	3.2061236901004406

After vasectomy on the interval of one month and then in the third month coming for the doctoral test is important and after the doctoral report intercourse can be done without any tension without any condom.	2.6549431479626016

But for this men do not agree easily.	4.525178360654274

The options for contraception for women -.	5.562673578319647

This is done in two ways - first through telescope and second by cutting the stomach slightly.	3.2623474180428147

By telescope the fallopian tube is either tied or destroyed.	3.7416552530357463

Both these processes are painless and hundred percent successful contraceptives.	3.5133330909207463

At our place since long intercourse is done by calculating the days which is considered a successful contraceptive option to a great extent.	2.8807477703395166

Apart from this regular and uninterrupted breast feeding is also considered to be a good contraceptive.	3.8051635108221378

In today ' s modern world though there are options one after the other like condom , pills which are kept in the genitals , copper T , etc , but the most effective options are contraceptive pills.	2.6426287092417766

Contraceptive pills are those pills which are eaten which women find the most comforting.	3.131557558930514

In modern times Karl Deresy is considered to be the genitor of contraceptive pills.	3.5148930737723356

Obesity does not only make the personality unattractive , it even attracts many diseases.	3.037129333183848

How should be the lifestyle for staying fit ? 	4.770154874356348

No one wants that there should be useless fat on his body but due to carelessness in lifestyle weight starts increasing and many types of diseases start surrounding.	3.0524217926470283

Today piling up of fat on body is a universal problem.	3.797890586040374

It should in fact be said that in case of obesity India is slowly on path of America.	3.250462565106034

Here obesity is given the status of disease.	6.247717989504425

Here every third person is victim of obesity.	4.143773340250232

If said in the language of the doctors , then any person becomes obese when in comparison to the calorie used by him he consumes calorie in more quantity through the medium of food and other food materials.	2.891490195604253

This imbalance in the consumed and used calorie may arise due to various reasons.	3.2654660922400467

Now this depends on the particular person that which reason is responsible for him becoming fat.	3.596878388609191

Obesity may also happen due to hereditary reasons.	6.083484886751359

Although this is also a fact that the food habits and life style of some families are the ones which increase obesity.	4.205792890147056

But despite this , it has been proved in researches that somewhere the biological makeup of human body is also responsible for obesity.	3.2156528177989525

Especially for adopted children it has already been proved that there is much closeness in their weight and the weight of their real parents in comparison to the weight of their adopted parents.	3.539794170083075

Environmental reasons also become a cause for obesity.	5.9676088697191485

What any person eats and how much he is involved in physical activity , it has a direct relation with his health , especially the weight of the body.	2.9094626889761894

If he does not burn the calorie received through food , then extra calorie starts accumulating in his body in the form of fat.	3.1785213399611836

And lastly the result is the person becoming victim of obesity.	3.8756333305941046

Today people eat a lot of fast food and fried things but save their skin from labor.	3.7202349325687094

At homes modern instruments are present for the help of women , then children keep sitting in front of TV , computer for hours.	3.1781244651852694

Not only this their mouth is always full with chips , chocolates and other market things.	2.758616656536226

On the other hand seven - eight hours of a day of office going women - men are spent sitting on the chair.	2.7944150658301226

What is meant by saying is that the opportunities for man to be included in physical activities are becoming less and less and the consequences are in front.	2.809127681148798

Even the smell of food makes the person obese.	4.958319505095284

Many times even when there is no hunger he comes towards the food attracted with the smell and in return he gets more calorie than the required.	2.8424956895231395

Psychological reasons also become the cause of obesity.	7.217379987083271

On being mentally unhealthy also there is tendency of man to eat more.	3.7216879791607926

Especially , on being victim of tension , sadness , anger or inferiority complex not only do the people eat more , but at regular intervals they also get the urge to eat something or the other.	2.418171811013026

This way they not only receive calorie in high quantity but by repeated eating the eaten food also does not get digested and the rate of their digestion the rate of the consumption of energy becomes disrupted.	3.029379031259147

In such situation it becomes a difficult task for them to get rid of obesity.	3.771169125787206

But it is seen up to the extent that the enthusiasm towards life in the person disturbed mentally diminishes.	3.507142205830999

And in such situation he becomes depressed towards keeping himself fit or to reduce obesity.	3.131985176387779

The diseases occurring due to obesity.	8.93288650034409

Heart attack , sugar type B , stone in gall bladder , high blood pressure etc.	3.9591136495768713

many types of cancer like cancer of intestine and prostrate in men , then the cancer of reproductive organs , uterus , ovary , breast and gall bladder etc.	3.3682917826547825

The disease of joints , the disease of liver , sleep apnia that is obstruction in breathing for some moments during sleep.	3.437314419723902

In women the irregularity of menstruation and infertility etc happen.	4.395099736268898

Some special types of diseases also make the body of the person fatty.	6.926580012656176

Hypothyroidism , depression , consumption of steroids or anti - depressant medicines are some such situations , when fat starts building up on the body of the person.	3.028424971094316

In women they have seen to become fat especially on the occurrence of the complication of thyroid or after the surgery of uterus.	3.647005608918925

Similarly after delivery also they become fat in an abnormal way.	3.5301286071121196

Although their weight starts increasing during pregnancy , but this is the stage of overweight , not that the quantity of fat starts increasing on the body.	3.723724527561893

While after giving birth to the child fat only increases on their body , gaining control over which is many times beyond their limits.	2.7965188354716273

Often the meaning of obesity for people is the increase of weight , but this is not the right definition of obesity.	4.233576423981064

According to medical experts , in the increased weight the weight of everything like muscles , bones , fat and water are included.	3.023067419329655

While with obesity the meaning is - accumulation of fat in body in proportion higher than a certain quantity.	3.3585199438219973

That is the direct relation of obesity is with fat , not with the increased weight of the body.	3.259748222557093

Like if we consider body builders and athletes then their weight is very high.	3.235634045139129

Despite this body builders and athletes are not fat.	3.8878889700658026

Body builders and athletes are stay absolutely fit and healthy.	3.582568193331422

But this does not mean at all that fat is bad every ways.	3.220330765423837

It is important that in every human being there should be fat in certain quantity for storage of energy in the body , for the maintenance of enough heat , to bear the shocks from outside or to other such important works.	2.7459547913740576

You are fat or whether you are fat or not , to know this it is important to know BMI or body mass index.	3.4224625343084956

The easy way to know BMI is - BMI = weight  height square meter.	3.103633268022336

If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9 , then it is considered that the weight of the person is more , while people with BMI of 30 or more than 30 are called obese.	3.501932592849762

Though BMI is incapable of saying this that in a person the quantity of fat is more or that of muscles , bones , fat , and water etc.	3.287253607274808

Then also with its help the quantity of fat can be estimated to a very great extent.	3.3596271116696905

To know this together with the weight of the person his height in square meter is also needed and in height all the organs of the person are included to a very great extent.	2.847319294940917

There is no alternative to exercise in reducing obesity , But if you feel that strolling morning - evening is exercise then it is completely wrong.	3.0554444351230856

With exercise the meaning is - to bring the heart rate to the level of 75 percent to its rate after doing exercise for 20 to 60 minutes.	3.2084376891688637

Like if your age is 40 years , then your desired heartbeat rate is 220 - 40 = 180.	3.874645898042855

Your level of exercise is its 75 percent , that is it should be 135 par minute.	4.287571139101796

For this anything in cycling , jogging , aerobics may be included in the daily routine.	3.5709915696921573

Together with this do yogay , also meditation , but while doing exercise you must keep certain thing in mind.	2.544834065622884

For heart patients walking fast , jogging or brisk walking are the best exercise , but if their has been a heart attack recently or there has been a bypass surgery , then definitely take the advice of the doctor before exercising.	2.716730404914481

With this keep in mind the following things in the daily routine -.	5.126320595849396

take deep breaths while exercising , but pay attention not to stop breathing.	3.338090959671446

keep at least an interval of one hour between meal and exercise.	4.260382372680965

Do not exercise when you are sad , in tension or angry.	3.8955168371136883

Adopt controlled lifestyle.	14.506763005346707

Smoking , drinking , mental tension fuel the fire , therefore escape from them.	3.194304686029281

If you are suffering from some psychological disorder or the disorder of overeating , then contact the psychologist or psychiatrist in time.	2.745567060107184

Because of more than required weight , children are becoming victims of the diseases which occur in adults.	4.609386593505143

Increasing obesity in children ahs come up in the form a serious problem.	5.822219374781723

It has become very important to control obesity.	6.155474836055251

doctors believe that the treatment of obesity should be done in childhood only.	6.600122458021191

Because due to obesity on growing up diseases like heart problem , diabetes and high blood pressure start cropping up.	3.0978594605192895

In maximum children the complaint of obesity is seen in the age of 2 - 5 years.	5.082541560122614

During this time the weight of children is more than their age , the chance of whose reduction diminish with increasing age.	3.9640657978856675

In countries like India increasing urbanisation and globalisation have pit a deep impact on the food habits of children.	2.8535953957834863

Today children relish the fun of TV , video game , DVD and other electronic gadgets for hours , because of which their sports have reduced.	2.5319633616719694

Also with this the consumption of junk food has also increased in children , the cholesterol , and sugar which are found in them only become the main reason in increasing the quantity of calorie in the body.	3.726395223143087

Because of the reason of these junk food only around 10 to 20 percent children in India become the victims of obesity.	3.072436906211905

By 2030 approximately half of the children of the country will come in the clutches of this disease.	5.753328846204557

In a survey done recently this thing has come up that in the last 50 years the consumption of oily substances in Indian children has increased 20 percent.	3.4615374849963496

In children eating candy , chocolate , pizza , hotdog , French fries and sweets the number of children in the age from 11 to 20 years is told to be around 80 percent , there the number of children from 9 - 11 years is told to be approximately 25 percent.	3.0153001288831023

Apart from this at home mother - father should pay special attention on the food habits of children , by which they eat fibrous fruits and vegetables in more quantity leaving the fatty food.	2.787551323042624

The government of every country should put a prohibition on the advertisements of junk food that are shown on the TV.	2.5746865122487557

Especially that time when children are watching programs on the TV.	3.9913930271750626

In every school the period of yoga , exercise and PT should certainly be organised because of which their outdoor activity increases.	3.149445251172332

Also with this it is important to highlight their performance in the report card of the children , by which they themselves also stay alert.	3.1858100647895546

the moment the eye of any person falls on the increased fat of his body , then immediately his attention goes towards his food and he starts dieting.	2.946972306029616

While for reducing the quantity of fat the requirement is of balanced diet.	4.413919011481424

Therefore , firstly get your check up done , so that it is assured that the weight is not increasing because of any disease.	4.2124607865274815

Get a diet chart made from the dietician according to your height , weight , age , sex and routine that how much calorie you should consume through your food daily.	2.3452978563061144

For your convenience some suggestions to control calorie are like this.	3.202159820440406

keep an account of you food and physical activities.	4.3271714210093055

Mind it that in return to the eaten things you have done labor.	3.7244695463502997

If you like eating ice then eat it after taking out the rice water.	3.491866417122891

Drink at least two litres of water everyday.	5.27822278829814

Do not eat mango , banana , sapota and grapes.	3.8614373256206793

Always eat thin dal and eat dal with peels moong dal , horse gram dal.	2.687378954198119

For chapatti instead of using flour of mill use thick flour made in millstone with the bran.	2.5539602739276894

This mixture of cereals does not let fat increase on the body.	3.764732546508265

For cooking bring in use such oil , in which there is less cholesterol like soya bean or oil of corn.	3.268139566677577

If there is desire to eat sweets then eat such sweets , in which there has been no use ghee like petha in place of gulab jamun.	2.8167299725894237

Consume less and less of fast food , meat , ghee , oil maida , sugar and dry fruits.	3.2854928055169657

Consume less salt.	15.614695741285086

The direct relation of obesity is with our food habits , but the important thing is ` right eating ' not ` less eating '.	3.134534148790095

The use of bypass surgery in the treatment of heart diseases is not very old.	4.567231016703903

This has proved to be a boon for the heart patients.	4.934799653985846

The obstruction created in the originating part of all the major arteries can be treated with bypass surgery.	3.295437337565812

Through the coronary angioplasty method a tube is made to reach the arteries of the heart through the medium of the starting point.	3.548293855861617

A balloon is fixed on this tube.	5.501385317335191

While putting the tube inside the balloon is deflated.	4.007537247921204

Studying the path of this tube on television it is taken to the place of obstruction.	3.734848310749662

Right at the pace of obstruction the balloon is inflated.	3.7420102928946406

By this the obstruction in the arteries of the heart open up.	4.956390919185361

Then the tube is taken out.	7.303263620444276

There are many benefits of this method like less expenditure , no need of surgery , there is no danger of infection as well and even one does not have to stay in the hospital for more days.	3.591643034605512

But this technique can not be brought into use for all the patients.	5.211475693803362

In opening up blocked arteries E.C.P.proves fruitful.	3.765811238343628

E.C.P.external counter pulsation is one such technique through the medium of which the blocks occurring in the arteries can easily be removed.	3.996681723025161

The moment the obstruction of the arteries are removed the transmission of blood in the body increases.	4.786929461442309

In the medical process of E.C.P.a set of three soft strips compressive cuffs is tied on the knees , lower thighs , upper thighs and hips of the patient.	2.406635393063711

This soft strip keeps inflating and deflating regularly.	3.6560017224862964

During this entire process these strips by putting pressure on thighs and hips increase the diastolic coronary perfusion pressure because of which reduction comes in the pressure exerted on the heart.	2.822697872948011

E.C.P.Treatment process is very simple and easy.	4.625186401181713

This treatment is given to the patient only for an hour.	5.792412043513943

In total this process continues for 35 hours in 7 weeks.	3.9576779081530735

The patient is neither made unconscious during this nor any kind of medicine is given to him.	4.006171802945398

During the entire process of E.C.P.The patient feels very easy.	4.071811138908671

In the immediate diagnosis of heart attack apart from E.C.P.And some special tests of blood at present a special type of camera is brought into use.	2.761706551217776

By this camera how much part of the heart has been damaged , this can be known.	5.05511929880173

The destroyed muscles of the heart may be diagnosed with the help of gamma camera.	4.614187843869978

According to the heart specialists , immediately after heart attack more damage occurs in the heart by the accumulation of blood clots in the coronary arteries.	3.8164497549968264

The clot of blood if accumulates on the upper part of the artery then the heart attack becomes serious.	3.620906359863418

Because in the upper part of the arteries only the flow of blood is more.	5.657232461297058

On the accumulation of blood clot in the lower part or the last part of the artery the heart attack does not become serious.	4.114316884382278

Due to the reasons of the newest technique of medical science removal of blood clots now has become very easy.	2.976489510783221

In the decade of eighties two injections were developed by the American medical scientists to remove these clots which are called ` streptochynas ' and ` urochynas '.	2.3707699691942934

For the patients of heart these injections have proved to be a boon.	4.4482635253891045

In the cardiac medical science this technique is known by the name of ` thrombocytic therapy '.	3.3720515187358213

But today for the diagnosis of the diseases of the heart newer techniques better than the other are available.	4.400286100879396

The myth that after heart attack life becomes worthless , useless and meaningless has changed now very fast.	2.4959625928922256

After becoming alright the patient may join their work.	4.247612936866749

The malfunctioning in the muscles of the heart may also be made alright like other diseases.	4.880271076722585

Rehabilitation is very important for the patients of the heart.	8.875092019657938

The meaning of rehabilitation is to make the patient capable of working again , removal of mental tension and making him able to lead normal life.	2.8229169668928566

Often after heart attack mental tension and fear start bothering the patient.	3.7017928629537975

For leading a normal life it is important to remove such apprehensions.	4.552423054393298

There are three important stages of rehabilitation.	4.690356946411234

In the first stage it is important to remove the fear of becoming incapable or death from the mind of the patient.	4.135840163092551

Also with this any kind of pressure exerted on the heart is tried to remove.	4.4746146854820905

This is that stage when the patient is made healthy mentally.	4.956773623619766

The initiation of making the patient disease free completely takes place in the second stage.	4.409652876390236

In this the person comes out of the bed and also starts climbing up some stairs gradually and at the end he comes back.	3.369475530204873

The complete effort of the doctor is this that once again the patient becomes a healthy and active citizen of the society.	3.8987388018387343

In the third stage it is tried to make the patient physically and mentally completely healthy.	3.80690719404684

In the SAAOL natural medication keep the heart disease free -.	4.221797373122865

Today the number of heart patients is increasing at a fast pace.	4.37325431344625

Medical science has also gone very far in this direction.	3.6246783842764008

With techniques like angioplasty , bypass surgery the successful treatment of heart disease is possible.	4.364998524651402

But various research studies on the heart patients reveal that by taking slight precaution in one 's life pattern , style of living and food habits and by doing yoga and exercise the danger of many types of diseases may be averted.	3.1012236740910524

After some days these symptoms are removed.	5.700018038532569

But after 7 - 8 days the symptoms of polio appear.	6.6508422282249615

The vertebral column gets stiffened due to the occurrence of fever , vomiting , dysentery , restlessness , pain , injury in the layer of the brain.	3.9488829493833273

On the disease not getting corrected the hands or feet or both the organs of the child become incapable of movement and locomotion.	3.175109686963666

The use of salk vaccine is done thrice in muscles through injection.	3.1661247677122826

First injection in the quantity of 1 m.l., six weeks after this second and the third injection is given after 7 to 9 months.	3.4630253569326395

With this vaccine for around four years immune power develops against its virus.	3.040439592762942

In this vaccine all the three types of viruses stay mixed diphtheria , tetanus and polio.	3.3348576718155467

The creation of sabin vaccine is also through three viruses.	4.017271588729331

There is the provision of making the use of sabin vaccine through mouth at the interval of every 1 month continuously for three months three times in total.	3.4545200490009282

Generally it is considered that the direct relation of heart diseases is with the increase in cholesterol.	4.876266901869346

As the quantity of cholesterol increases in body , the danger bell for heart gets rung.	3.710321538059335

But in modern experiments one such element has come to be known , which is considered to be far more lethal to the heart than the cholesterol.	3.094402639276063

This substance is - amino acid named homocystin which is four times more sticky substance than cholesterol.	2.8216760409902366

This gets produced in the body during the process of digestion of food only without protein.	4.832944506473993

First that in which some part of the breast only is removed as per need.	5.117759523672576

This is called conservative surgery.	6.460596671957527

This is possible only in the first and second stage.	6.50466578553599

The need of chemotherapy arises in 80 percent women.	4.9367934403279685

In the first stage the success of surgery is 85 percent.	4.040027429981713

In the second stage 60 percent , 45 percent in the third stage and 15 percent in the fourth stage.	3.8881642106732044

Deep , comfortable and sufficient time of sleep rejuvenate the body or makes the body young again.	3.273649715998308

The damage which occurs in tissues , the deficiency that comes in energy , all that is again fulfilled during sleep.	2.8376564097276877

In such case if one does not get enough sleep , then problems like pain in the hands - feet , dark circles around the eyes , headache start from the very next day.	3.176543495529274

For proper sleep it is also important that your bed is comfortable , one gets enough sleep to change sides and with less disturbance at least eight hours of sleep is got.	2.5838367418348316

Not just that in sun also you should protect your skin.	3.8942710228305346

Staying in sun for more than ten minutes could be dangerous.	4.679347600795313

Long menstruation or onset of menstruation at any time , more menstrual flow or menstrual flow for long duration is also a disease.	3.098030185707393

Its symptoms are the following - increase in weakness , giddiness , loss of appetite , pain in hands , feet , back , stomach , waist etc while sitting or rising.	2.8795621045676256

sometimes this discharge becomes wound on increasing and foul smell also starts coming out of it.	3.818930353512646

Because of this reason there is itching around the vagina and the quantity of calcium starts decreasing in the body.	3.726750717163974

For this the chief medicines are pushyanug powder , triwang bhasm , kaamdugha juice , moenorrhagia preventing pearl rich juice , ladhrasaw , leukesil etc.	2.0556735244312647

During menstruation the mind - body does become little uneasy , but many times these days the complications also increase.	2.7804563622404954

Though rainy season is considered to be a good season , but it is also the reason of many diseases.	5.182583859429641

The humidity and temperature of this weather is helpful in the growth of organisms and insects.	3.968288258831205

This is the reason that in monsoon indigestion , allergy , dysentery , cough , cold , eye infections etc diseases occur.	2.6096754593319065

On drinking polluted water also diseases occur in which typhoid , cholera , jaundice , amoebiasis are very common.	2.782299553411901

These days at every place there are heaps of garbage and the water also continues to get accumulated which is the suitable place for the breeding of mosquitoes , flies , cockroaches etc.	2.452729658293386

Many types of diseases start spreading through these.	5.199732543790426

From mosquitoes malaria , dengue etc spread.	5.327612851324678

The cockroaches pollute the food materials by reaching in the kitchen , due to these diseases of stomach happen.	3.691538337386464

In monsoon the cold or stale food may also be harmful for health , because in them fungus and bacteria start growing which make the food poisonous.	2.9576998888901262

In this season stale food should not be eaten.	5.075762303600929

In rainy season only the respiratory diseases also occur more.	4.083624015342908

Allergic sinitis , bronchitis , asthma or pneumonia may occur in young children.	4.235283824771789

Skin diseases also trouble a lot in rainy season ringworm , scabies , itching occur more in these days only.	3.159599118105722

The diseases occurring in rainy season.	6.896412047854518

Dysentery with blood - due to the consumption of polluted and contaminated water in rainy season and due to the weakness of stomach pain and spasm happen.	4.284693845685553

In order to remove this disease take poppy seed , dry ginger powder and candy sugar in equal quantity and make powder by breaking - grinding.	2.483193132842939

Take this mixture one spoon each at the interval of every 3 hours.	3.436074094092332

By consuming three - four times a day with one cup water which has been boiled and cooled mucus , dysentery with blood and spasm and pain in stomach get stopped.	3.2011347565868205

Till the time of benefit do not consume fried things , heavy things , hot tea , hot milk and salty substances.	3.1335388116660754

The immune power to bear those matter and environment are not there in the body , due to the effect of that matter or environment there is reaction in the body and it is called allergy.	3.838419175964074

In rainy season due to the allergy because of polluted environment and substances in some people breathing or respiratory diseases occur.	3.1845195221130895

To avoid this complication equal quantity of mulhathi and fine powder of turmeric should be mixed and half spoon should be taken with warm water two three times in a day.	2.6631295462968128

By this method one gets riddance from disease like cold , respiratory diseases , dry cough etc and immune power develops in the body.	2.6993605095213544

Because of contamination of water in this season dysentery , vomiting appear separately or even together.	3.8506557497447993

ANM bahanji had also said it that if the child faces difficulty in drinking mother 's milk or his breathing becomes fast then it would have to be taken to the hospital immediately.	3.3396338711004976

Radha knows that there is complete nutrition in the milk of the mother.	5.545893790895348

Therefore for complete four months she fed Muniya with her own milk.	3.1586952899470857

ORS , glucose or not even water , no matter how much hot or cold it had been.	3.24417326533215

In the initial days do not bathe the child only wipe with cloth.	3.553957237958884

Up to four months do not give anything other than mother 's milk.	4.0776085090390195

Definitely take the weight of the child.	6.6847712184929104

If the child has problem in drinking water or the breathing is fast then immediately take it to big hospital.	3.2564937646692216

Exactly one and half months after birth Radha took Muniya to get the vaccine injected.	3.701107299917984

Behanji said that vaccine and doses save from six polio like diseases , therefore in getting the entire vaccine there should not be mistake.	2.7197348289674004

Exactly after one month Muniya received vaccine and dose again.	3.5011627344929805

Every vaccine was registered in the mother - child protection card and every time behanji reminded Radha of coming the next time for the vaccines.	2.5799498209407346

Behanji also told Radha that she should not forget at all the vaccine of diphtheria that would be put in the ninth month of Muniya.	2.893535652608495

Because of if the vaccine is not given to the child and if diphtheria occurs then after that diseases like dysentery , pneumonia , malnutrition and sarsaam etc.	3.311954567327881

But on the completion of ninth month Muniya got the vaccine of diphtheria and with it she also received the drops of vitamin A to save from night blindness.	2.7925333651272917

She will continue getting the dose of vitamin A every six month up to three years.	3.5300014126551407

This you should also remember that on the decided dates you must get the vaccine - dose given.	3.7296326144326475

Every time get the protection card filled.	4.950639129485521

Do not forget the vaccine of diphtheria on the completion of ninth month.	3.2822500567565003

Give the drops of vitamin A up to three years.	5.082421922487274

repeated.	63.754508145769194

Radha had fed Muniya with her own milk from the first month her birth and up to four months she had not given her anything apart from her milk.	2.4360358824682615

Every month Radha had to take the weight of Muniya.	6.310292962796319

On sixth month the weight of Muniya was twice from that at birth.	3.598974648081004

Radha became happy that the weight of Muniya had increased correctly according to the saying of A.N.M.behanji.	3.4030651827251406

Then three - four times a day Radha started feeding Muniya half bowl of mashed chapatti , dal and vegetables.	3.225040837757984

And with it Radha also used to give green leafy vegetables , papaya and gourd so that night blindness does not occur to Muniya.	2.9439613482529308

Now Muniya is of one year , today is her birthday.	4.372853750529604

Now her weight is three times of that at birth.	4.545153153548415

Every body at home are happy that nurturing of Muniya is happening in the correct manner.	3.2767706531168663

Now Radha feeds Muniya half bowl of food even five - six times in a day.	2.9946098699992008

You all should also remember that in six months the weight should be doubled.	3.579545660590037

To the child of four to twelve months half bowl of food must be fed three - four times a day.	3.3322253079126325

The weight should be three times on the completion of one year.	4.210969195859962

From twelve to eighteen months feed half bowl food five - six times a day.	2.7082090564215284

One day Muniya started getting loose motion.	4.594811675518649

Radha became worried , she remembered the saying of A.N.M.behanji that because of repeated dysentery the water of the body and the salts come out and there may even be danger to his life.	3.016070117299878

Immediately as per told by bahanji Radha started giving liquid items found in the house repeatedly to Muniya.	3.313783133730184

But together with these things behanji had also asked to give O.R.S.but that there was no O.R.S.at home.	2.8805908433485414

Sohan brought O.R.S.packet from anganwari.	4.833757429830246

Radha made O.R.S.solution according to the process told by A.N.M.bahanji.	3.8947352419554275

And made Muniya drink after every dysentery.	4.603141534261525

Next day Radha threw the leftover solution and made fresh solution.	2.9771946915599035

Apart from this she also continued feeding complete meal to Muniya.	3.12505292444897

In two - three days the dysentery stopped on its own and Muniya became alright.	4.01359160873174

Everyone should remember it always that as dysentery starts in child , keep giving domestic liquid things after every dysentery.	2.4375366506889575

Deficiency of water in body is very dangerous , therefore keep giving O.R.S.solution as well.	4.1182052415981145

At least give half bowl of food four - five times in a day certainly and even after this there is dysentery then take her to health center.	3.3373947774464563

The treatment of cough - cold may be done even in the house.	5.132041758333813

Therefore on contracting cold Radha treated Muniya this way.	3.528660406291859

By giving more and more things to drink and by feeding regularly.	3.843201742503128

Muniya became alright in three - four days.	6.181830315480395

But Radha thought if her condition would have become worse even after doing everything.	2.816302489681252

Bahanji counselled that the meaning of such happening is pneumonia and there are three symptoms to recognize it stopping of food - drinks , fast breathing and rib movement.	2.682971539819142

In such situation take the child to bahanji immediately and get her administered the medicine of pneumonia.	3.4802987986626297

If bahanji tells then immediately go to big hospital and get her checked up.	3.295216211561856

If due to any reason you do not find bahanji then also take the child to big hospital immediately.	3.564202120727536

Muniya did not even become of one year that mother - in - law started expressing the desire for a grandson.	2.895400589872452

Radha asked bahanji , she said that it will take two to three years for the weakness that has come in the body after the birth of Muniya to go away.	3.7394562598570364

As such if there is pregnancy then there may be problem as well as complication and the prospective child may also stay weak.	3.544500551559076

Also Muniya will stop getting mother 's milk and her care will also not be taken.	3.7941594873737166

Radha understood , the meaning of more and frequent children is disease in the destiny of child , malnutrition and twelve months of money crunch.	2.94469133719767

Bahanji told easy and reliable ways of contraception.	4.841702646035725

After discussion Sohan and Radha chose the right way and decided that for three years they would not produce second child.	2.533627531566275

You should also remember that there should be a gap of three years between two children.	4.595758565480291

Conception before three years is bad for the health of mother and child.	4.4896175258481685

For keeping gap between two children use condom , pills or copper - T.	3.5793363537097065

On stopping the these methods second child may be given birth to.	4.3370194209206065

One day some people did a counsel after coming to the village , Radha and Sohan also went , the discussion happened regarding the stopping of disease through hygiene.	2.2956752726419283

After toilet putting soil or ash over it.	3.9527122863532878

After washing the hands properly only feeding the child and using clean water.	4.706630888154933

To protect food from dirt and flies.	4.635183899896918

Burning the garbage of the household or burying it in the ground.	3.9685774442947523

Not letting water accumulate near well or hand pump.	4.071010495129338

Through all these things the prevention of diseases may happen to a great extent.	4.335876632716193

Everybody liked the talks and with the help of institution and panchayat people completed these together.	3.076932257440245

Sohan and Radha in fact even swore to ward off dirt and disease.	2.934595449648497

After some days the result also came in front , as dirt lessened the diseases too started reducing.	2.568272576698927

Diabetes has taken the form of an epidemic in the world and its various kinds of social and financial adverse effects are also coming forward.	3.4330105748978252

In the patients of diabetes diabetes foot is an extremely serious problem.	4.813949663544596

Thus in the whole world in every 30 seconds surgery of amputating the foot of a certain patient afflicted with diabetes foot takes place.	3.2691691043711413

My intention of telling you these figures is not to frighten you , but to caution you.	2.4900571269768044

The ancient proverb of Prevention is better than cure is absolutely successful in diabetes disease.	3.0915448370191703

There is a chance of occurrence of ulcer in feet to the patients of diabetes due to the following two reasons.	4.866029611958393

In the patients of diabetes because of damage occurring in the nervous system there is decline in capability to feel in their feet and they do not feel pain at all due to which wound or injury in feet does not get detected in time.	3.0680100894765423

In patients of diabetes because of flaccid blood circulation wounds or injuries heal late and on occurrence of a small wound danger of infection keeps lurking.	3.046658333780576

Such people whose blood level is high can suffer from diabetes foot.	3.4810998870855565

There is a chance of this number increasing to become about 860 lakh in 2030.	3.5147039603555457

There are a number of reasons behind cases of diabetes increasing suddenly in India.	2.9456129683330796

Having congenital reasons , having much weight , imitation of western lifestyle , sensitivity , stomach fat and insulin resistance with less weight.	2.3241572564432924

Diabetes can affect various body parts.	5.961209285297939

Nervous system , eyes , kidneys , bones , etc.also have not escaped this epidemic.	3.0943267100337084

By diabetes disorders can occur in bones , joints and muscles and nerves.	4.224708382543072

Because of which stiffness in joints - swelling , ulcers in feet , decaying of feet else feet can become dark.	2.6413790659357006

If proper control is not kept over diabetes then bone related diseases can occur.	3.007377669708159

If an elderly woman is afflicted with category - I diabetes then danger of bone breaking increases by it.	2.905841665634572

If bone breaks then it takes a long time for it to join.	4.827907350479968

In addition to this bones become basically weak because due to deficiency in insulin developmental process of bones stops.	2.652601345887117

This does not happen in category - II diabetes afflicted as most of the patients of this category are fat as a result of which their bones are also big and strong.	3.146975424704806

Hence patients of category - I require an average of 1200 mg Calcium and 400 to 600 units ' vitamin - D ' everyday.	2.7597594290219294

Dose of osteoporosis is necessary for patients of category -1 like common patients.	4.734226059128556

According to an interesting research if baby is given ' vitamin - D ' then danger of occurrence of category - 1 diabetes reduces.	2.9139843902041274

There is more chance of occurrence of infection to patients of diabetes.	4.524202797927529

Various deformities and mortality rate can increase in patients due to infection.	3.7223064123049556

There can be various reasons for its basis.	4.144944378575781

Immunity reducing , nerves of body or nervous system getting affected negatively , glucose level increasing in skin.	2.9721069876301165

The level of amount of glucose in skin exceeding 150 , danger of bone infection increases.	3.956429070217729

Hence controlled amount of glucose is necessary in surgeries related to bones like joint transplant and treatments like joining or setting a broken bone.	2.409674139782765

If level of glycosylated hemoglobin increases by 2 % then by that danger of occurrence of abscess or ulcer increases by 1.6 % and danger of amputating a body part increases by 1.5 %.	2.5768723956728024

Here it is reasonable to discuss the topic of diabetes and infection of feet because it is found so in most cases.	3.2243105471143436

Due to the reason that sensory nerves get damaged , the feeling of hot and cold and injury in feet gets reduced and feet get continually damaged.	3.0742992379808824

By damage of nerves that are manager of muscles there can be paralysis in feet , feet can become deformed or twisted.	3.0934244812246714

By exertion of more pressure on less space chance of formation of ulcer increases.	3.8083914026066727

In this manner by damage of nerves that control the temperature of skin , skin gets worse.	3.205670249016388

Because of blockage in the blood circulation of feet proper nutrition is unable to reach the feet and less white blood cells reach there.	4.139879328785673

Hence immunity becomes less.	9.247891150446245

Bone diseases occurring due to diabetes are in this manner :.	5.734314563836722

Weakening of bones , change coming in the walk , balance of body is not maintained by blockage of nerves occurrence of decrease in immunity , wound not filling up fast , getting an infection again and again from wound not healing and consequently from these diseases starting from handicap of patient even death can occur.	2.2111378648400057

Because of diabetes infection of feet begins from the soles of feet.	3.6038227571477526

In the beginning there is a redness in skin which remains even after pressing.	3.830654817402211

Skin gets tough.	14.405019776126661

There can be formation of ulcer by injury in foot that reaches the muscles and bones and pus can develop in foot , fingers can degenerate or darken.	2.4346609575664946

You should cure patient immediately , surgery and amputation of foot are also combined in the treatment.	3.056920783589278

Infection of foot because of diabetes is a state of emergency.	5.8356634820300535

There is influence on joints because of diabetes.	4.724425896904548

Disease named ` Charcot joint ` can occur to 1 out of 600 patients of patients afflicted with diabetes.	3.8830235883554782

The difference between infection and Charcot is this that in Charcot feet of patients are red , swollen , and twisted and patient does not have any pain in it and patient does not have fever.	3.338875358811374

A specific kind of test might be necessary to detect ` Charcot joint `.	3.4622973318519445

Aid of diabetes control glucose control in blood , plaster of a specific shape , shoes and surgery can be taken in the treatment.	3.2396087378301313

As a result of the bone breaking often deformity can occur in joints also.	3.6301680930050884

Skin of hands of patients of diabetes becomes thick , stiff like wax and dried up.	3.6736507195178727

Fingers of hands stiffen and snap on bending.	3.9392019898581307

Nerves get deformed due to diabetes.	5.6652648784990784

Blockage occurs in blood circulation in vessels by excess of glucose in blood and other defects can also arise in vessels because of which most patients lose balance related control of sense and body.	2.951154002312904

Many problems like shock in hands and feet , feeling a burning sensation , in hands and feet going numb , occurrence of paralysis and fingers getting distorted can originate.	2.823777303911642

Defect can also arise in the muscles of feet and patient is unable to walk properly.	4.827739263921619

Occurrence of problem like compression of nerve by thickening and stiffening of skin near and inside joints and by blood circulation not occurring normally is a common symptom.	2.394544539482153

Mostly nerves of wrists can compress , by compression of medial nerve of wrist ' carpal tunnel syndrome ' occurs.	2.3035008506193675

In this pain , shock and numbness which usually increases at night time occur in thumb and with it in two and a half fingers.	2.6749184073019974

This difficulty can also happen to patients of diabetes by working on the computer in a wrong position or working much , holding the newspaper , etc..	2.9634930760996525

Having disease of diabetes for a long time.	6.422961873243645

Not having a proper control on blood glucose.	4.442484748421791

High blood pressure , heredity , race , smoking etc.can also be causes of diabetes generated kidney disease.	3.662471604734831

Diabetes generated kidney disease occurs because of protein urea on increase in amount of protein in urine and glomerular filtration rate G.F.R.	3.289809289340562

The main cause of diabetes generated kidney disease is uncontrolled level of blood glucose in body.	3.41374449768344

However imbalance of blood glucose in body is harmful for cells and other body parts which can become a cause of various kinds of ailments.	4.079839198340914

Hence it is possible to prevent diabetes generated kidney disease to quite an extent keeping level of blood glucose controlled in diabetes patients and diagnosing the disease on the preliminary level and detecting microalbumin urea in the urine.	2.518607456069897

Urine of 24 hours is tested to detect microalbumin urea.	4.165009115353678

The family planning program was started in the country from 1951.	5.611097288191614

Its aim was only to plan the population.	4.4936132654532965

Afterwards for the attainment of the missions of the program it started being used for mass education and propaganda.	2.9466412310916144

In the decade of seventies by stressing on vasectomy extreme strictness was done in the achievement of goals.	2.647632982538085

As a result opposition was produced among masses towards family planning program.	2.876686486159006

During the seventh plan year 1985 - 90 in place of the family planning program the program was given the identity of family welfare.	3.5473890249574174

In this special emphasis was given on the health related needs of women of reproductive age and children of less than five years.	3.2227693502892176

In 1985 - 86 pervasive vaccination was started.	6.6144316659433775

In pervasive vaccination the aim was fixed to bring down the death rate and sickness of young children from such diseases whose prevention is possible through vaccines.	2.5526537488809797

Thereafter by looking at the benefits of this program in the decade of nineties child safety and safe motherhood C.S.S.M.was prepared and implemented from 1992 - 93.	2.492742081798452

In the present times all the family welfare services continuing from before were kept implemented.	2.733426174017408

After unifying the plans created on the sub centres it would be given the form of district work plan.	3.66156469066417

The district work plans together would take the form of state work plan.	3.729161313925435

In order to supply the goods to state the national plan would be based on the state work plan.	2.4926850696886738

It is written in it that the government investment during the eighth plan for family welfare is reducing.	2.883230226832347

The extra expenditure of the eighth plan has also been less than that of the seventh plan.	3.726939210394893

This situation looks even more unsatisfactory.	5.310403632030877

At every level there is a need of upliftment of health care system.	3.9480335779296296

The health care program should be made to reach to more and more people.	3.936139108027483

So that at the end the national goal may be achieved.	4.419972655265822

However because of the economic development , spread of education  literacy and due to the rights given to the citizens there has been a constant improvement in the program in the past years.	3.7738270765278075

In the states with less execution many problems are present in relation to weak implementation , because of the women not receiving enough rights and education  literacy.	3.022428714353379

Under the reproduction and health program the solution to these problems would be achieved through the following strategy.	3.3756555431595507

Under the child safety and safe motherhood C.M.M.S.plan in the unification process of the programs one more step was taken in 1994.	2.4011926717609158

In the population and development conference in the country of Egypt the proposal for the unification of reproduction and child health R.C.H.programs were tabled.	2.5164224470126695

In the reproduction and child health policy it has been emphasized on this thing that people should have the power to control reproductive force.	3.3448690400259684

Couple should be able to keep sexual relation without the fear of conception or disease.	4.25097475186233

Accordingly the mission of the ninth plan was kept that all the related programs of eighth plan would be unified.	2.546987336390546

Or else not starting to give any other food materials apart from mother 's milk even after six months.	2.9692110498748145

In the ninth five year plan the registration of all the children in the school , continuation of the mid - day program and test of the weight of children and disease should be arranged.	3.3217740792278834

In youth the physical and mental growth occur very fast.	4.307899468334902

The boys will only fulfil the major responsibilities of the house.	3.3739041763542716

While apart from the responsibilities of the house the girls have to give birth to children later on.	3.772805160015543

If the girls are weak then post marriage their children will also be weak.	3.6331362834493137

Apart from this henna is useful in reducing the temperature of the body , curing headache.	4.9587396542311

henna is also useful in removing the inflammation of the legs.	6.413250303476633

It gives relief in problems like excessive sweating in palms.	4.418783031831198

In many Oriental countries the use of henna is done in the form of medicine.	6.05772065007489

In Morrocco in order to keep the house cool the residents even paint the door of the house with henna.	3.315939312938319

In henna there is one such chemical which is helpful in leprosy , small pox , headache.	4.345520826594602

Henna is useful in removing problems like burnt skin , wound and eczema.	3.915635111931131

If there is fever , then apply the paste of henna in palms , fever will lower fast.	3.1486050115463216

In a new study it has been found that during pregnancy the chances of the children suffering from asthma is more forwomen who stay tensed.	3.999073767708651

According to the researchers of Bristol university if during pregnancy the women are treated for tension then the cases of asthma can be stopped from increasing.	3.0094007581492894

In Britain 10 lac children and 40 lac adults are suffering from patient.	3.899270181980897

According to the chief researcher Professor John Handerson , ' Due to tension only many types of hormones get secreted in our body whose effect is seen on the child and its immune system during pregnancy which spreads in the form of disease like asthma in future.'.	2.9821091335618335

In this study 14 thousand children of 5800 families were included.	3.6929802756014616

The researchers had asked questions even to the mothers of these children.	3.552721601354864

Whenever a person is ill , then he knows that which medicine he has to take and how much to take.	3.3914652989181997

If the disease is in the lower part of the body , then the consumption of medicine before the meal is beneficial.	4.981197692925972

If the body is to be thinned , then the medicine should be taken before meal.	5.320158908417224

In the ailments of stomach , abnormalities of bile the use of medicine should be done in the middle of the meal.	4.557779940238108

Strong people should generally take the medicine empty stomach.	4.3592586495482255

For the upper parts of the body the medicine should be taken after the meal.	4.981798460653566

Medicines for cough produced ailments and to make the body fat should be taken after the meal.	3.905241406505305

Boys , girls , fragile and those hating the medicine should take it with the meal.	4.068404177407041

In respiratory diseases , cough , intense thirst , vomiting and poison related diseases the instruction is to take the medicine a little after meal.	2.90777157097054

In diseases of ear , nose , throat and eyes it is beneficial to take the medicine before going to sleep at night.	3.571417022112067

The consumption of medicines which are repulsive and of intense smell can also be used before meal.	3.619653972182082

Children actually jump around enough the entire day then why do they need to exercise ? 	3.2478833018072524

If you also think such and do not inspire your child for exercise , then in one way you are compromising with his growth.	2.8522572449576082

The university of Illinois did a study on the physical education and exercise in children and discovered its multiple benefits.	2.8896830209066726

It was found in the study that positive influence can be seen on the study of the physical education class , exercise program in recess time and after school.	3.1576011897464813

The study done by professor of community health Charles Hillman says that physical education enhances the ability of the student to concentrate.	2.6372914573591495

Prof.Hillman said , ' the aim of this study was to know whether light exercise like , walk can even have good impact on the health of child.'.	3.1972698171084026

During the research the study was done on three bases.	4.273218705788523

During this a positive link was seen between physical activity , concentration and academic achievement.	2.709075599062538

In the study 8 girls and 12 boys of 9 years participated.	4.048819680028926

In order to know there control power many stimulus tests were done.	2.8708998867319826

In the research it was seen that children who walked everyday did the test in better way.	2.6539182422166365

So far that even to complete difficult challenge these students did less mistakes.	2.908698940151525

It was also seen that even in the midst of noisy environment these students were able to do the work with more concentration.	3.0582514794495035

Because of all this much improvement was seen in the reading , spelling and maths.	3.320462842107684

Mobile phones which are becoming the integral part of the modern lifestyle may also become the cause of the spread of disease.	3.7630590162551703

Here in the study of the mobile phones of the workers of ' Washi ' situated MGM hospital this fact has come up.	3.0010197996750483

By this there is chance of the occurrence of skin disease , food poisoning , acne - blisters , toxic shock syndrome and other diseases.	2.8995010650429327

In this study done by the Indian Medical Research Council 120 mobile phones of the workers were tested.	3.033573551133342

The researcher Dr.Nikhil Tambe final year M.B.B.S.student of MGM hospital found that bacteria and spores were found on 99 phones out of them.	2.2213424617699906

This bacteria together with making the disease of the patient serious also become the cause of the delay of the cure.	4.060228730178536

Tambe said that the presence of the maximum number of bacteria were found in the phones of the technicians.	4.736816415450235

After this the mobile phones of ward boy , nurse and then doctors were found infected serially.	2.713386418514656

Dr.Chitra Pai , chief of the microbiology department of the hospital said that on the mobile phones maximum 54.6 percent ' staphylococcus accrues ' bacteria were found.	2.4672104071644667

This microbe can become the cause of skin disease.	5.798983053810403

Apart from this in mobile phones microbes like E - Coli and pseudomonas were also found.	2.6254076417907912

Due to the infection of E - Coli and pseudomonas microbes maximum ill effect is seen on the health.	3.408640000317715

Two years back in a study done in Coiambatore the presence of 96.2 percent microbes was found on the phones of hospital workers.	3.150173278232129

First let me tell you as to what are antioxidants ? 	3.94231728215742

As our age passes some or the other type of loss occurs in our body.	3.612048855309511

We generally see that some people appear old before age while some appear comparitively young even at the age of 80 years.	2.37684043979312

The answer to this is with modern medical science and this answer is the deficiency of antioxidant in our food.	3.2571729151680495

All around us there is pollution , tensile environment and many among us smoke cigarette actively.	2.761316570240531

All this speed up the process of destruction in body after uniting.	3.959986304334149

Even the diseases of the heart to great extent can be due to this destructive process.	4.97608326537622

Just like the rust on the iron exposed in air which occurs due to oxidation the cause of the destruction in the body is also oxygen and tissues  the chemical reaction of the enzymes.	3.1518566465026

The accumulated fat in the arteries of the heart L.D.L.Cholesterol gets oxidised before getting accumulated.	3.29836554266527

Antioxidants are micronutrient substances which stop the destruction occurring in the tissues and organs of the body.	3.0957219798002793

Therefore these have immense capacity to keep the disease of the heart at bay and for its treatment reversal.	4.268705449617605

Along with antioxidants there are other substances as well which are essential to make the food complete which help our heart and other organs and make our body healthy and increase the immune capacity of our body.	2.5697631269758916

This collection of the information of heart , throw light on these food making it complete.	3.1635279586443987

This is the wonder food of future antioxidants.	4.273690479086537

In continuous fast life generally man is left devoid of nutrition or else stays dependent on diet consisting of less nutrition.	2.4244894512438657

In this relation can we think something for ourselves or our family instead.	2.758229803734155

This is that portion of knowledge related to nutrition which has been specially created for us.	3.138594694136435

Every capsule of this knowledge give us information about vitamins and minerals , which are important for our health.	2.9532202323815353

What are free radicals ? 	10.144640750286026

In what way do these harm human body ? 	4.1880393418636155

In what way Vitamin E and other antioxidant nutritive substances protect the body from the destruction of free radicals.	3.0204671559475282

We will try to give answers to these questions and will tell that fruits and vegetables rich in 5 - 8 types of antioxidants may be beneficial for your health.	2.7334639155140525

For the knowledge of this thing that how free radicals and antioxidants react with each other , little bit of knowledge is essential in the subject of tissues and molecules.	3.0718892249664442

Physiology , for the revision of chemistry brief chapters have been given here.	3.245977590202187

Human body is made up of various types tissues and tissues are made up of various types of molecules.	3.7126271708467478

In molecules there may be one or more atoms which remain tied due to chemical bond.	3.228710249723164

In atom there are nucleus , neutron , proton and electron.	3.423151443616748

Electrons participate in chemical reactions and keep the atom tied in the form of molecule.	4.080417841759084

Electron keeps the atom surrounded in one or many shells.	4.200244682782375

Certainly oxygen element is extremely important for life , but in some conditions it is even harmful for human body.	3.1376866093768863

Due to the reactivity of oxygen many harmful compounds are formed.	3.1271939005624585

These are called the compounds of reactive oxygen species.	3.897752733153202

Reactive oxygen compound give oxygen to other substances according to their own nature.	3.42532524292315

Many out of these reactive species are free radicals and consist of one or more extra electron.	3.632025273709679

This way because of the lack of similar compounds it is the cause of instability and extreme reactivity.	4.703819558433376

Oxygen atom is the cause of the reason of ageing , heart disease , stiffening of the artery , the reason of loss of immune capacity , damage of free radicals.	3.3532519630861857

Due to these losses the conditions of stiffness of the arteries , diabetes , cataract and premature agreeing arise.	2.809141591148031

The contribution of antioxidant is extremely effective in the prevention of cancer , heart disease , Alzheimer 's disease , rheumatism and cataract.	3.370436235565072

Together with different oxidants these work in different cellular compartments.	3.342849340786373

The system of enzyme is an important aspect of immunity capacity , glutathione peroxidise , superoxide dismutase and catalase etc which reduce the accumulation of some harmful oxidants in the tissues.	2.459232048933828

Some essential minerals are - selenium , copper , manganese and zinc etc are essential for the production of the activity of the live enzymes.	3.0686947422218576

Another security line of the immune capacity of the body towards the harm of the free radicals is the presence of antioxidants.	3.7556712818787608

Antioxidants is a molecule which is at least so stable that they can give one electron to free radicals and make them inert so that their capacity to harm is lessened.	2.5998639522091342

Some antioxidants of this type are antioxidants , glutatione ubiquinol and uric acid which are produced during the normal metabolism of the body.	2.782432294875674

Though till now around 9000 antioxidants have been detected.	4.252573730706127

The most popular antioxidants are Vitamin E , Vitamin C and carotenoids.	3.6846337552986665

Tissues of oxygen free radicals oxygen free radicals are produced during digestion.	3.89895538543403

These poisonous molecules of tissues are produced in the body due to the cause of the light of the sun , x - ray radiation , food , tobacco or the smoke of car and other pollutants of the atmosphere.	3.4083883469719747

In fact these free radicals harm DNA that is the ones providing hereditary characteristics.	3.1325251318593

Microbes convert chemical compounds and at times completely destroy the tissues.	3.7216336397069067

With the help of antioxidants the compensation of this damage can be done.	3.490070818218794

In which way can the antioxidants protect from the harm occurring due to the frss radicals ? 	3.897941758346996

The ones providing immunity are the antioxidants substances.	4.204036579088274

As it is clear from the name antioxidants are those substances which stop the destruction occurring in the body and normalise the oxidation process occurring in the tissues of the organisms.	3.0920084369838237

These nutritive substance vitamin and mineral are enzymes the supportive protein in the chemical reactions situated in the body.	2.8498206448461403

It is believed that these protect from the ill effects of the free radicals.	3.675263619206533

By donating their personal electron the antioxidants depress the process of stealing electron by the free radicals.	2.8034496545721037

After shunning the electron also they do not become free radical because in themselves they have stability.	3.1567909017694338

Antioxidants stop the process of oxidation , by deactivating the free radicals.	3.983121879030572

In doing such the oxidation of them takes place.	4.0495734439042

Though you take multivitamin regularly , consume extra vitamin C , many types of fruits , vegetables , then also it is not essential that you are getting sufficient antioxidant.	3.6118077081940587

With respect to these nutritive substances fighting cancer , health enhancer specialists have given opinion.	2.785905017236399

here such substances are being named which should be taken in daily breakfast.	4.347074756642125

Among the antioxidants given daily there are vitamin C , vitamin E and selenium.	3.1570112485851345

Vitamin E is found in two types tocopherol and trocotreinol.	4.7631361960935905

If you are taking any vitamin E then it would be tocopherol because at present tocopherol is under research.	2.799254689786879

What does tocopherol do ? 	8.894694677147601

Tocopherol protects from heart disease , stroke , Alzheimer 's disease and cancer.	4.305663591557049

The immune capacity also increases with tocopherol.	5.544208335649197

Trocotreinol fights against heart disease , breast cancer , it also protects the skin from ultraviolet radiations.	3.454337593052287

Where is tocopherol found ? 	8.981594147913903

In less quantity tocopherol is found in almonds and vegetable oils.	4.674988097264369

Trocotreinol is found in the husk of rice.	7.2138972391621605

For therapeutic dose the need for other complementary substances arises.	3.8840926457334852

The dose of natural Vitamin E has been suggested in the form of 400 to 800 I.U.Of mixed tocopherol.	3.1411754433225014

What does selenium do ? 	8.88774481312599

Selenium protects from cancer , heart disease , cataract , muscular degeneration and is supportive in the function of other antioxidant.	2.6884070058946716

Where is selenium found ? 	8.974609209078716

Selenium is found in brazil nut , cereal , vegetables and its quantity various according to the regional soil.	3.9199426538944504

In the suggested dose 100 to 200 mcg of selenium with food or even without food daily.	2.5829205480112822

Do not take selenium in large quantity otherwise poisoning may occur.	3.720888660114153

Start taking antioxidants after the age of forty years.	4.703472333300154

If before the age of 40 years you have to take many pills then you should not take coenzyme Q - 10 alpha lpoic acid.	4.010312072800147

Coenzyme Q - 10 fights against cancer and heart disease.	4.636800338739799

Coenzyme Q - 10 makes the gums strong , protects nerves , is helpful in energy production.	3.557427047275962

Where is coenzyme Q - 10 is found ? 	5.669132320685775

Coenzyme Q - 10 is present in each tissue of body , specially in heart.	4.010562142621788

Coenzyme Q - 10 is also found in almonds and oils but for medicinal dose extra quantity may be needed to be consumed.	2.725332934650586

In the suggested dose with daily food 30 mg of coenzyme Q - 10 specially , is important for heart patients.	2.905024182619774

What does alpha lipoic acid does ? 	5.883571660628254

Alpha lipoic acid protects from the nerve damage related to heart disease , cancer , cataract , stroke , diabetes.	3.089764003637871

Alpha lipoic acid increases the level of glutathione.	5.774486944620632

RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VAUX V_VM PR_PRQ N_NN N_NN N_NN 	2.8054054060151685

In some food substances very little quantity of alpha lipoic acid is found example lettuce , meat , potato etc.	2.746536158718003

In the suggested dose 100 mg quantity of alpha lipoic acid with food , 200 mg everyday can be taken by people suffering with diabetes.	2.579958217249616

What is the sufficient quantity of nutritive substances ? 	6.011191131437609

In 1941 American Food and Nutrition Board decided the quantity of various types of nutritive substances after guessing the quantity of nutritive substances , the protection of body through nutritive substances , through figures after studying the scientific history.	2.8050477419972117

For each type of nutritive substance the board has decided recommended dietary allowance RDA which is 98 % diet for healthy people , which the body can easily accept.	2.4968482870723605

Tolerable Upper Intake Level UL - is that quantity of nutritive substance which a healthy person can consume everyday without any harm.	2.7762355621888113

Only in some cases the board could not decide yet that how much quantity of nutritive substance would be beneficial or harmful.	2.8353767468040854

How to choose antioxidants for fighting the diseases.	4.286617713818211

Whenever you buy fruits and vegetables , keep in mind that you choose only those whose color is bright.	3.7073468599871733

As much bright the color of the fruits and vegetables that much more would be the antioxidants.	4.496559084474159

Apart from this there are more antioxidants in fresh fruits in comparison to canned , cultured or heated food materials.	3.6121956045386914

Generally if you consume food materials with little variation then you get more antioxidants.	2.999079772530648

Like in comparison to green colored or white colored grapes antioxidants are found more in red grapes.	3.7813684538234686

In comparison to white onion red and yellow onions are more antioxidant rich.	3.033912964862756

Cauliflower , cabbage raw or light cooked broccoli is highly rich in antioxidants.	2.8839851924842392

In green and grinded garlic much antioxidant is found.	3.7047307565522942

In comparison to canned vegetables fresh and frozen vegetables are richer in antioxidants.	2.7585339438391934

In place of boiled or steam cooked vegetables the vegetables cooked in microwave is richer in antioxidants.	2.41541459201696

Dark green leafy vegetables are highly rich in antioxidants.	4.682015141681176

In place of juice whole fruits are rich in antioxidants.	3.3762387168044756

In place of canned juice fresh and cold juice is good source of antioxidant.	3.3354802303966715

Dark orange colored carrot , gourd and sweet potato are substances rich in more antioxidants.	3.1406286366260203

Being scared is also mental disease.	5.744740025416073

The person suffering from phobia knows that his fear is meaningless and not correct , but then also he is not able to keep control over it.	2.790976745136482

The disease of being scared has been found more in women.	4.526985399980306

Generally this problem arises between 20 to 30 years.	5.419079564486353

Many times this problem gets finished on its own.	4.222893143582657

In the situation of no treatment it keeps the person disturbed for long time.	3.2294081278743483

having fear or being afraid is one of the many normal emotions.	3.798671650251138

Fear is in the mind of every person.	8.257976571395428

The fear of going in social gatherings , meetings , groups of people and other such situations is called social phobia.	2.7390446340197356

On facing social phobia the person becomes worried of this thing that whether other people do not consider him weak , stupid , bad etc.	3.005394306649815

The person suffering from social phobia always has the misconception that in such situations the people 's gaze would be on his behavior , dressing and minute actions.	2.3411522202819457

Everybody would try to point out shortcomings in him.	3.5113266932343814

The starting of the problem of social phobia comes up maximum in puberty.	4.40497118349576

The main symptoms of social phobia are avoiding going in other people 's , meetings , marriage , parties etc.	2.6074105267026395

On the confrontation of such situations feeling restlessness , fast heart beat , panting and strange restlessness in the brain.	2.767230720165691

Reduction of the symptoms on their own on going away from these situations which disturb.	4.114636637926877

In social phobia not being able to converse by looking straight into the eyes of others.	3.4689781168645517

Panicking while talking to others and feeling lack of confidence.	4.228997384395127

feeling uneasy in doing special tasks in front of others like - eating , writing etc.	3.319603896678137

The starting of shivering in voice and limbs while talking to others.	3.3777883888680647

Not able to face the audience after going on the stage.	4.317350701813418

Due to all these reasons the limiting of the lifestyle of the person are the symptoms of social phobia.	4.376669739486956

Due to the disease of agoraphobia the person is scared of that situation where going out immediately is difficult.	3.127267727373542

For example - the fear of getting stuck in crowd , bus , train , lift etc.	3.364547791022002

In the disease of agoraphobia the person is extremely scared of such places and he stops going to these places.	2.8322501430454126

If by chance also he faces such situations then he starts feeling very scared and helpless.	2.5593694207949986

On the situations becoming serious the symptoms of rapid breathing , cold limbs , shivering , sweating , increase in heart beat , stomach pain , dryness of the mouth etc.	2.9120594889409785

many times the person starts feeling such , as if his life will come out now.	4.204940620837055

If in such situation the patient is present with any of his dear ones then his fear gets reduced a bit.	3.285504107887873

Specific phobia is not considered so serious.	5.56086839610113

In specific phobia much difficulties do not arise in the daily life of the person.	4.085007507536343

the fear from any specific thing or situation is called specific phobia.	3.311270475456539

For example the fear more than usual arising out of cockroach , cat , lizard , river , bright light , noise , blood , skyscrapers etc.Come under this category.	2.2699102238585045

The problem of fear in some people also arises due to genetic reasons.	4.109598915706612

In some people the genes of this disease comes from parents which gives rise to the problem of fear on getting negative environment.	3.657316574502628

The appearance of the problem of fear in the blood relatives of people suffering from this increases in comparison to general people.	4.47256877209298

Even after tiring to know intensely , many times it becomes difficult to know the matters on their mind and this problem goes on continuing for long time.	2.6940297291770583

In one way the problem of hysteria is the voice of the mind.	4.918855213186287

Generally the meaning of hysteria is considered in the form of the onset of bots of unconsciousness.	4.1799226563057665

But there are many types of hysteria.	8.962489971067074

Due to ignorance this myth is popular pervasively that this disease occurs due to the effect of various supernatural powers , ghost , spirits , souls of dead etc.	2.755178332098568

Actually hysteria disease occurs due to the reason of the problems happening at the mental level.	4.325296978185522

In India hysteria disease is found more in married women.	4.357429106329198

the disease of hysteria is found in children from 5 years to even men.	6.738043737184091

The chance of the occurrence of the disease of hysteria is the maximum between the age of 10 up to 30 years.	4.8743286848534435

In psychiatry hysteria is known by the name of dissociative disorder.	4.051043895391268

The symptoms of the disease of hysteria are as follows.	4.636693805956443

RD_PUNC V_VAUX V_VAUX N_NN PSP N_NN PSP N_NN N_NN PSP N_NN 	2.085633461917627

Theatrical hysteria - in this the patient conducts as if in him there is the residing of any god , spirit or ghost and the powers of giving boon or punishment have come in him.	2.4899820033854074

That time the voice of the patient also changes.	7.176990534886974

Big crowd of audience get surrounded near him and people ask for favors from him.	2.585906757744643

Paralysis - in this the condition of weakness appears in one or more organs like in hand , foot , shoulders etc.	3.646853890185068

Whose relation is not with any physical deformity or disease even.	4.142216499014573

At times there is such feeling as if the body organ has stopped working.	3.3244586920364796

Many times for doctor also differentiating between actual paralysis and hysterical paralysis becomes difficult.	2.5940954770748386

Dumbness and noiselessness - in these conditions the patient is not able to speak anything.	4.293948155502751

But without any problem he can whisper , can do his talking by writing or gesturing through hands.	2.751161775549044

On investigation all the organs of the patient of hysteria like the tongue , lips , sound cord etc are found to be working in normal way.	3.5287937035461376

Why does hysteria arise ? 	8.813421764177034

The mind complicated by some problem when fails to find any solution then the situation of a mental conflict arises.	2.8662766408790294

In such situation if any person is not able to face his mental strife or is not able to express his problem in any way then the suffering mind finds the way to escape from his problems or to express them through hysteria.	2.7880567342857554

Often women due to social and domestic situations are not able to express their desires and feelings and consequently many types of internal conflict arise in their mind.	2.7300315546538862

These conflicts continuing in the sub - conscious mind become the reason of hysteria.	4.161561298332131

Hysteria is completely the game of sub - conscious mind.	4.014590048720124

The addiction of intoxication is also the disease of mind.	7.534029987368847

The biggest problem is this that those people who do intoxication they themselves do not know whether they are the victim of addiction or not.	3.6337608444355114

One person who takes eight - ten pegs of alcohol only four or five times in a month he assumes that the addiction of alcohol has occurred to him.	2.7213428594148796

On the other hand that person who takes half bottle of alcohol every night and can not sleep without drinking , says to himself that no - no I am not drunkard , drunkards are of different kind altogether.	2.1759502143944434

I drink only some , that also while sleeping.	4.196321112464123

The person does the intoxication of anything and to him any of the three things out of six things given underneath apply to him then assume that he has been addicted or used to for intoxication.	2.4172577728859155

Intense desire to take intoxicating substance.	6.597888444336175

Repeatedly failing in the attempts to quit intoxication.	4.161146748107869

Arising of physical and mental problems on the unavailability of intoxication like the shivering of limbs on not getting alcohol , not getting sleep or getting restless.	2.8155635282536244

Gradual increase in the quantity of intoxication because after some time the effect of the previous quantity starts reducing.	4.900930949208093

For example the person doing smack intoxication in some months from half gram smack his coming to two gram smack.	2.386494508690568

Wasting a lot of time in the consumption of intoxicating substances.	7.516490181280529

The person ignoring the other aspects of his life like socializing , doing his work , care of the children etc.	3.2976436360058914

Intoxication is harming the body , despite knowing this continuing intoxication.	3.6493476888306358

For example despite jaundice and vomiting blood not stopping the consumption of alcohol.	3.7434583455288837

Apart from this other symptoms like intoxication in solitude , harm to the physical and mental health , taking intoxication in large quantity in one go etc are also the signals of the problem of intoxication.	3.4467827796732124

Beer , whisky , champagne , vodka , rum , gin , brandy , alcohol , country made alcohol etc come in the category of alcohol.	2.79122057560764

Opium related substance - opium , smack , brown sugar , capsules proxivon and spasmovon , the pills of lomotil etc.	2.354032410420594

Other substances - amphitamin , L.S.D.Solvent petrol , eraser fluid , polish etc cocaine , tea , coffee etc.	2.328443518634263

Tea , coffee are also in fact intoxicating substances , but due to not being much harmful they have been accepted on the social basis.	2.788234687924545

Being mentally or physically dependent on substances affecting the activities of body and brain is only called the addiction of intoxication.	3.438127755527668

The addiction of intoxication has been considered a mental disorder.	4.556573136049495

The Indians alone drink approximately 120 crore litre of alcohol during a year.	3.027178260793626

The consumption of alcohol in India is continuously gaining strength.	4.780701905235291

If the drunkard is able to quit alcohol foursome months then it is good riddance , because during this his body and liver gain strength as earlier.	2.9062537813052005

But if the liver has become absolutely bad then even after quitting alcohol it does not become alright.	3.26704118193092

For the patient it is very difficult to quit alcohol on his own is very difficult.	4.182213726535867

for this a lot of will power is needed which is formed in very few people.	4.254040456056193

Some people think that by gradually reducing the quantity of alcohol one day I will completely quit it in fact such people deceive themselves.	2.690169701281195

In order to get rid of this problem it is extremely important to take the advice of the psychiatrist.	4.300876586294345

People in whom there is no internal desire to quit alcohol , their family members should certainly meet their closest psychiatrist once.	3.4237109312498384

many times the work appearing difficult is in fact easy.	4.64824551993708

Through some methods in such addicted people producing the internal desire to quit drinking may be tried.	2.629922576075215

To treat addiction two method are used one is through medicines and second through behavioural treatment.	2.6806388938275436

In the treatment through medicines some special medicines are started after completely stopping the alcohol of the patient.	2.7638121920879555

After some days of this the patient and his family members are told about two different types of medicines.	3.772985336418131

One medicine helps in reducing the addiction of alcohol while the second medicine produces negative effect as the alcohol is consumed.	3.0789462849788216

Due to this medicine reddening of the face , vomiting , breathlessness , restlessness , giddiness , fainting etc occur.	3.2118834032408436

Due to the fear of these negative effects the person stops consuming alcohol.	3.54060004427571

In the behavioural treatment talking with patient , counselling , relaxation , exercise , desensitization , aversion therapy , group therapy etc are included.	2.24544144287636

Along with medicines behavioural treatment also has very important contribution in treatment.	3.3838633741695845

No matter what the addiction is , after getting the treatment 60 - 70 percent people again start the intoxication within few months.	2.8034539153247766

In such situation the patient and his family members should meet with his doctor again without feeling sad.	2.918959113488899

Today the main aim for the treatment of intoxication of the psychiatrists world over is to keep the person addiction free for long time after successful treatment.	3.2986094461560254

If the person drinking alcohol more than required is not ready to stop alcohol completely or else is unsuccessful in doing this , then the consumption of alcohol in controlled way may be one way of treatment.	2.7137530692015193

This method is determined after talking to the doctor.	4.464138655894165

Abstain from the quacks advertising the medicines for quitting alcohol without telling.	3.2474128509871965

Keep in mind that addiction also is the disease of mind only.	4.253341496870236

Other diseases like running nose , cold , cough may occur again similarly the addiction to intoxication may also occur again.	2.7582279137776995

Therefore do not panic , take stem for repeated treatment.	3.793601872110909

This way after gaining control the desire to do intoxication dies gradually.	3.7494857328803164

After the treatment the doubt of the family members on the behavior and conduct of the patient becomes the cause of complex for the patient.	4.084190909485359

The more the absorption of oxygen in the body that much more energy would be produced and as much energy is produced that much we will stay disease free.	2.9972549073284696

This way laughter is the healing and nutritive element of life and it may also be called the essence of life.	3.607029994751177

Through laughter changes come in the bio - chemical construction of our body.	4.5077806975250105

Due to laughter reduction comes in the level of hormones producing tension namely cortisone and epinephrine because of which the body becomes tension free and the meaning of tension free is health.	3.231409017538936

Apart from this due to laughter the quantity of hormone named endorphin increase which is a natural painkiller and works as disease immunity for the body.	3.0689694244803527

According to the research of Dr.Lee Berk of Rosalinda University of California T.Lymphocytes stay more active because of laughing and staying happy because of which there is increase in the growth of those natural cells which are called killer cells.	2.66022676438963

These killer cells are capable of destroying those dangerous cells capable of the growth of cancer.	3.511408490133898

This way by laughing one gets help in getting rid of dangerous diseases.	4.202632285355012

When you are surrounded by depression then laughter only is one such medicine which can stop your depression.	2.981434616342063

Due to laughing all the pain , all tensions melt away.	3.369200646883568

Due to laughing the body gets relief after becoming tired.	4.121110417557487

A cheerful person never suffers from depression and not even does the activity of suicide.	3.358034596480088

Objectively the treatment of all the depressing diseases is hidden in laughter.	5.261463831761049

Objectively laughter is the only one such medicine which is capable of stopping wrinkles externally and is helpful in making you full of motivation internally.	3.2920652986519716

Laughter is a spiritual health , laughter is burden less.	3.9467858634092314

When you laugh then you can keep your mind separate.	5.913120522594764

The person who can not laugh for him the door of intellect is closed.	3.1878915567504467

For me the importance of laughter is high.	5.694623226392312

Any religion has not thought of laughter ever.	4.27962811866397

Religion has always emphasized on seriousness and therefore all the world went on becoming sick psychologically.	2.612638077594296

Through laughter throw away the coat of negative point of view or seriousness forever.	3.1794451795466023

Leave making excuses and smile a little.	4.399952582586822

After this laugh and laugh strongly.	5.032485815005877

This only is the invaluable essence of life and the art of living the life with enthusiasm.	3.1570902175869517

In homeopathy the treatment of esitinse disease has proved to be fruitful.	5.352539074911402

In last stage of patient suffering with liver disease esitinse disease has been seen.	4.383398417378011

In esitinse disease water accumulates in the stomach.	5.161852992332653

This esitinse is seen in the disease of kidney , the disease of peritoneum , heart disease , sound system , self stopping fever , cancer , the diseases of blood vessels.	3.9618890251976056

esitinse is not disease on its own , but this disease is seen in the guise of other diseases.	4.569593415680245

In esitinse disease due to the accumulation of water in the stomach the front portion of the stomach appears to be big and high , the amount of urine decreases and often constipation persists.	4.1633827703659945

In esitinse disease there is difficulty in respiration.	6.907450233547844

In this disease the heart beats strongly and sometimes one feels thirsty and sometimes not.	2.8752106111015863

In homeopathy in the disease of esitinse the following medicines can be administered and observed.	3.8347030210427087

You can see by giving Epismel - 30 if the urine is very less , there is no thirst , there is intense pain in the muscles of the stomach , inflammation and pain in the body at various places like stings , difficulty in respiration on lying down , relief in sitting down.	3.466031200485389

The aposinum medicine is fruitful in all types of swellings.	4.1335515483647605

Due to eposynum disease there is intense excitement in gall bladder.	4.249687547963519

Aposynum medicine is given to the patient on the occurrence of the following symptoms vomiting immediately after drinking water , urinating like mud , dysentery.	3.8807575283041036

Apart from this among other homeopathic medicines chayna , colchicam , canbalbulus ars , lycopodium , natrumsulph etc medicines are those which you can take under the guidance of the nearest able doctor.	2.402581195992169

Why do we yawn ? 	9.501463540835482

According to Dr.D.Balasubramaniam there are many things in the daily life which are considered common but we do not have any explanation of these with us.	3.0750928117163223

Yawning is one such thing.	10.902186485108613

If I see you yawning then why do I also start yawning ? 	3.1483671143634693

Why is yawning like an infection ? 	5.652851166267018

Why do we start yawning a little time before going top bed and immediately after getting up ? 	2.932695825091123

Together with yawning why do we stretch ? 	4.986785310053039

Someone had said that yawning is like economics regarding which everyone has his one favorite explanation.	2.500618355625342

A very popular belief is this that we yawn then when we need more oxygen.	3.5812983174707784

But it has been found that this belief about yawning is not correct.	4.128594632337587

Dr.Robert Provin of Maryland University is doing research on yawnings for long time.	2.6734571236720805

Dr.Robert Provin made some people sit in the room and kept on changing the composition of air.	3.4247874356981653

At first he made the volume of carbon dioxide 3 - 5 percent in the room and observed the rate of yawning in people.	3.176410305318203

After this he made the volume of carbon dioxide zero percent and once more the rate of yawnings were seen.	2.698952542925472

It has been seen that both the times the rate of yawnings dimension has been nearly equal.	3.1476320731875056

Do we take more yawnings when we are tired ? 	4.274732899168356

No difference has been seen in the dimension of yawnings before the exercise , during and afterwards.	3.6103926220730678

Does yawning have any relation with age ? 	4.86757124499511

It has been found that new born baby and even the foetus yawn.	4.066129490712991

During ultrasound inspection yawnings have been recorded in twenty weeks pregnancy.	3.164468815923851

It seems that this action is approximately as important as respiration , movement of eyes and parturition during birth.	2.615821126006366

This is an involuntary action on which the person does not have any control.	4.365282199671715

Yawning is not a simple action.	8.845324330644601

On average yawning is of 6 to 7 seconds.	4.894589604327205

During yawning the air is inhaled till deep and then released all of a sudden.	2.9038444375919195

During yawning the heartbeat rate increases up to 30 percent and many types of nervous scientific changes occur in the brain.	3.6314277089478395

It seems that the relation of yawning is to the attentiveness of waking up.	3.229544171559921

By this one understands as to why long spells of yawning comes to people suffering from nervous scientific problems epilepsy , multiple sclerosis.	2.4766325016027975

On the basis of the nature of the disease , the availability of the related medicine and its process of effect the doctor prescribes the patient to take pills , injection and syrup according to the need.	3.0160645694162556

Maximum medicines are available in all the three forms of pills , syrup solution , injection.	4.605696931366178

Then also there are many such allopathic medicines which are available in one form only.	4.3570144411462195

Keeping the condition of the patient , age , condition of the disease and the effect of the medicine in sight the medicine is made to reach the body through the following media.	5.354879206106443

Through the mouth the medicine is given in the form of tablet pill , capsule , syrup solution.	4.496055719393594

The cover of capsule is made of gelatine which melts after going to the gall bladder.	3.41974954699486

With the name of medicines which are to be drunk you often read linctuses , mixture , emulsion.	3.7073303150028964

From linctus the meaning is of that medicine which generally is in sweet solution.	3.31701675176904

Mixture is the solution of many medicines in water or in other chemicals.	4.102913855236847

In emulsion there are two solvents which generally becomes negligible.	3.766048718004035

The medicine of heart disease is placed on the tongue , which shows effect immediately by melting gradually.	3.914052015568511

This medium of taking the medicine is called ' sub lingual ' medium.	4.945782247568441

Injection and allopathic treatment have become the synonym of each other.	3.5545490571983027

For giving glucose and other medicine fast into the body injection is given intravenous that is through the medium of arteries.	3.1672506519672226

The veins visible on the outer part of the body take the deoxygenated blood towards the heart.	3.5271153045209096

Opposite to this the arteries situated in the deeper parts of the body take the blood to the rest of the body from the heart.	4.978392584646059

In the arteries this blood flows with the speed of 65 kilometre per hour.	3.351767028495386

Then only the arteries are heard to be beating fast.	3.8280540549295448

In general terms it only is called ' pulse '.	4.680001463544207

the second popular medium of giving injection is ' intramuscular ' that is giving injection in the muscles.	3.1704934072601274

Generally injection is put on the upper or outer part of the arm or the upper part of the hips only.	4.27935686902763

Actually in both these places the nerves beneath the flesh is less.	3.2456120464743012

If any nerve gets damaged through the needle of the injection then it can be lethal for the patient.	3.233379428483582

Apart from these popular methods there are ' subcutaneous ' and ' intradermal ' methods as well.	2.7368198836810413

In these methods instead of putting the injection deeply in the flesh it is put at low depth beneath the skin.	2.7270612822329094

The ' turbutaline ' injection in respiratory disease and ' insulin ' injection of diabetes is put through this method only.	3.257535964607809

In the subcutaneous method the effect of the medicine is slow.	5.194324144373526

Apart from this injection is also put in stomach peritoneal.In chect pectoral and spinal cord spinal.	2.751764601405742

In the diseases like asthma and cough the patient takes in some medicine by inhaling through breathing.	3.2045576233336925

The medicine to make unconscious during surgery ether is also given through this medium alone.	3.2996620555986995

In the medium of local application ointment , balm , oil etc are applied in body pain , warts , injury , itching atc on the essential places.	2.5443130766911772

The ointment applied on the nose , ear and eyes and glycerine etc applied on mouth ulcers also come under this category alone.	2.8563254881575104

How does the medicine show its effect ? 	4.723365414909892

The medicines given through the injection enter the blood flow directly only.	3.833447829206059

Therefore the effect also is quick and pervasive.	4.4391313676692645

The medicines taken through mouth digest with the food in gall bladder and intestines.	3.7830906764133294

The intestines fail to absorb these medicines completely.	4.202055022315091

If they stomach is empty then the oral medicines show more effect.	3.392843117602014

The medicine absorbed through the intestines goes to the liver through the ' postal vessel '.	3.581809518948043

If the functioning of the liver is not alright then maximum medicines become inactive.	3.464071228161786

various types of enzymes affect the chemical activities of the medicines.	5.380363678329958

From the liver the medicine goes to the heart and from there through the pumping action it sends the blood to every cell of the body.	3.3466010248837863

The medicine travels in the entire body through the plasma available in the blood.	5.4872353296418765

These medicines finally mix with the fluid available outside the cell and show their effect wherever there is need of medicines.	2.641315059746204

After the consumption the remaining medicine is excreted through the urine after reaching the kidney from the heart through the medium of the excretory parts of the cells.	3.045888939353842

Therefore during the excretion of some medicines the color of the urine appears to be yellow , red or dark.	3.174092181217416

Which medicine stays in the body for how long and for how long it affects , on this basis alone the doctor prescribes the mode of taking the medicine to the patient.	3.064669384383732

Even after scholarly studies and researches the exact theory of the effect of the medicine has not been developed.	3.554402362303533

Receptor Theory ' proceeds by considering this that along with special tissues there is a construction named receptor in the body which attaches to and then speeds up as the medicine comes close to the tissue.	2.848092979679721

The second theory is of ' antimetaolitis ' , according to which the cells acquire their nutrition from special type of elements.	3.063369839379089

The antibacterial medicines too possess the shape of nutritive elements.	4.170231391820738

As such the microbes etc consider these as nutrition and their growth stops.	2.911178810202025

Finally the microbes die and the patient become alright.	5.5798639642712455

Some enzymes do the work of ferrying the liquid inside and outside of the cells.	3.705527700068068

Some medicines are capable of affecting the general nature of these enzymes and the functioning cells.	2.9306630152819064

Allopathic medicines are made of various types of plants , minerals , chemicals and the body of animals.	4.592420860106497

These medicines show effect according to the nature of the specific disease.	4.974776206422242

Some medicines fulfil the deficiency of special elements in the body while some deactivate the chemicals which have increased.	3.9095206227297488

Similarly some medicines provide speed to the activities of the body while some finish off the growing microbes.	3.742004514037606

Due to this reason alone the side effects ill effects of English medicine is also very much.	3.878095552670212

As it is clear from the name alone , the attainment of the condition of sleep through yoga only is yoganidra.	3.1189926479307526

What is yoga ? 	13.52424578264973

The control over the activities of will or mind alone is yoga.	3.8918140356849436

Handicappedness is an extremely ancient and omnipresenet problem.	5.216869124333826

The people of all the parts , religions and communities of the world get affected with handicappedness more or less.	3.623946268047823

Everyone male - female , rich - poor can be the victim of handicappedness.	4.621000790754716

With time change has come in the appearance of this problem of handicappedness.	5.476636007452555

Today control has been achieved to very great extent on measles , reasons of blindness at birth , leprosy , polio etc.	2.7297656908886077

The cases of cerebral palsy and mental retardation are increasing.	4.397386316664472

The spread of education in handicaps is also increasing and the understanding of people towards handicappedness is also becoming positive.	2.8493077865874676

Technical development has provided artificial reading power to blind people , better hearing power to deaf people , improved movement to skeletally handicapped people.	2.2071062651705615

The development of medical science has prevented the growth of diseases and put reins on the process of conversion of diseases on handicappedness.	3.2232336662918577

The spreading of education among handicapped people is increasing due to the efforts of Indian government , state governments and self help organizations.	3.0652005325925678

Today the situation has come to this that by providing suitable environment and extra facilities the handicapped people can be included in the mainstream of society.	2.7812749703237607

Now instead of becoming burden on the society the handicapped people may come in the condition of contributing to the society.	3.4906767743553

Computer , information technology , automation have made working for handicapped people very simple.	3.0591642921696907

Now in comparison to normal people handicapped people may contribute better.	4.782030758133663

The weakening of any part of body , situation arising due to deformation is called handicappedness.	3.4384479170098063

The ability of sight plays important role in our life.	4.679063535916107

Most of our activities are possible because of our reason of seeing.	3.4500743502330335

The various types of deformities occuring in eyes become the reason of vision imparement.	4.5410711043223735

How much is the vision impairement this a specialist doctor can tell only after complete check up but there is also an easy method of testing it.	2.9683502003195215

If a person is not able to count the fingers of a person standing at the distance of three metres then he can be considered visually impaired.	3.483413183480206

The complete investigation of visually impaired person is essential.	3.7080325804124703

A big part of the eye ball is white.	6.674384980493611

This white part maintains the shape of the eye and also protects its fragile construction.	3.843418842856194

A small part exists in front of the eye which is called cornea and it works as a window.	4.4785165946652645

Light enters through the medium of cornea.	8.097518749617775

Hearing impairment is that condition in which child or adult is incapable of hearing partially or in complete form.	2.929490722716678

There are many types of hearing impairment.	5.340078894940922

Many times outer and middle ear fail to transmit sound to the inner ear.	2.7243393411451797

In such situation the person faces difficulty in hearing.	4.106820899257346

One more reason for this can be this that dirt gets accumulated in the canal of the ear.	3.8902802671702377

Apart from this deformity in the construction of the bones of the ear , injury or because of the reason of any disease also it can happen.	4.991497151837514

The reason of other type of deafness can be the deformity in the inner ear.	4.217344206767821

The more the deformity , more is the loss of hearing ability.	4.264989784574854

In the innere ear place is decided for every frequency.	3.2482520137371456

In the inner ear the loss at any frequency becomes less and on some it becomes extremely high.	3.169027931672113

There are many reasons of this type of deformity but generally due to the reason of damage of the minute construction of cochlea this deformity takes birth.	2.9939178385416985

In some children due to the damage occuring in cochlea the ability to bear loud noise gets destroyed.	3.6336279056668626

The more the damage becomes the ability of child to recognize words become that much less.	3.241250380174938

When the damage occurred in the cochlea it does not get corrected through treatment and surgery then there is no other way leaft apart from wearing the hearing aid.	3.076806278612759

If the pregnant woman suffers from from viral fever , influenza , chicken pox , mumps etc in the first trimester then the child in the womb can be adversely affected.	3.0821816501234554

The child in the womb can also become deaf.	5.965265407040019

The complications during birth like foreceps delivery can have influence on the ear.	2.956598300952972

Continuous flow of water and pus may also become the reason of becoming deaf.	5.266108316062371

If the pregnant woman eats unnecessary medicine without the consult of the doctor for abortion or any disease then there could be adverse effect on the foetus and it may also become deaf.	3.4518012652322554

There are two ways of safety from deafness.	4.397034738369391

First way is this that one should stay away from those diseases which give birth to deafness.	4.8992016801992655

Second this that if there has been the influence of this disease then it should be prevented from being converted to handicappedness.	4.7849924757529

The useful instrument used for hearing in deaf people is basically a small electronic appliance.	2.675822912412023

This electronic appliance is also called a minute mike.	5.2514483530392635

Through this electronic appliance or minute mike the sound can be amplified many times.	2.7210794509367657

Speaking is actually a special process which differentiates us from other organisms.	3.316854529342811

If by 15 months the child is not able to speak meaningful word then it is essential to get him tested.	4.38032489183923

If by this age the child starts speaking words like mummie , papa then there is no reason to worry.	3.9798175477505366

If the voice of the child is abnormal , heavier , or comes with obstruction then also it is essential to get it c hecked up.	3.449696234345291

During management program the exercises for the growth of child is being done.	4.84383063688297

During management plan the activities of daily life are taught.	4.179354312157226

The child is taught to speak , move etc under the management plan.	3.0420803380136228

Under this the difficulties of the children are solved and the treatment of the diseases are also done.	4.948011100350034

Some activities among these take place in hospital or rehabilitation center and some take place at home alone.	3.3251773691068993

The activities which take place at home are demonstrated to the mother - father and important instructions are given to be repeated at home.	2.974020897748179

According to the American Association of Mental Retardation that person is called mentally retarded who is not able to do his simple activity.	2.970022168966498

The measurement of intelligence is less than 70 and bothe these problems start affecting the person from the age of 18 years only.	3.3202114024035696

From 0 - 6 years the child learns to stand up , walk , run , eat , wear clothes , use toilet , keep clean , to converse etc.	2.3436951204545213

From 6 years to 12 years of age the child learns to read - write , talk meaningfully , to help etc.	3.5273237662924948

From 12 to 18 years of agethe child learns to do all his domestic work and lears to use hospital , post - office , public vehicle , phone etc.	2.3924880929599457

The child acquires skill in sports and entertaining activities as well.	2.9245237548318235

the child learns to do useful work as well.	4.293237830433519

That child whose growth rate is less than the above mentioned rate he is considered to be mentally retarded.	3.8095229365779795

Intelligence measurement scale is a method to measure intelligence prepared by the scientists.	3.8237876773387067

The average IQ of man is from 90 to 110.	5.5374144040315665

If the IQ is between 70 to 89 then the man can lead satisfactory life.	2.6626284463859298

On the IQ being less than 70 it becomes essential to pay attention to him.	3.72069904023024

If the IQ is between 52 to 69 then the man is considered to be less mentally retarded.	3.204521731110351

The man with IQ between 36 to 51 is considered to be average mentally retarded.	3.5602642770097788

If the IQ is between 20 to 35 then he is considered to be extremely mentally retarded.	3.607239282898133

The people with IQ less than 19 are considered to be extremely serious.	4.476648654469625

Making a mentally retarded child recognize himself and learn his own name is an art in itself.	2.632211989117104

For this during all the activities of the menatlly retarded child like bathing , changing clothes , eating , playing etc.his name should be called.	2.4482632996800167

Apart from this after showing the reflection of the child in mirror his name should be called out so that he can recognize himself.	2.9730770070091403

For making the mentally retarded child learn to drink milk at first he is made to sit in front of the mirror and shown to hold the glass.	2.848258206395058

The child becomes happy by seeing himself in the mirror drinking milk.	3.5125401982554987

Initially the child has to be given support but later on the child the child starts drinking on his own.	4.410853584505148

People who are mentally ill are entirely different from mentally retartded people.	3.060628766148023

The IQ of the person mentally ill is average or more than average.	4.242312941404707

The growth of the person mentally ill also takes place normally.	5.777185439099338

These people are victims of the psychological disorder and become alright through medicine or psychological treatment.	3.276701539698252

Due to psychological disorder their feelings become deformed and along with it effect is seen on the intelligence as well.	3.098569293494236

The persons mentally ill generally become alright after treatment and lead normal life at home.	2.8319863939581085

If the hands of the person are incapable then he would considered to be the victim of the impairement of the upper skeleton.	3.8030294987501367

If the legs are incapable then he would be considered to be the victim of impairement of lower skeletan.	3.209052257920579

There are many reasons of skeletal impairment and some among these start from pregnancy itself.	2.6843283299749

Many diseases occurring to the pregnant mother become the cause of handicapedness in the child in the womb.	3.8828668568486733

Many times from the time of birth the hands or feet of the child remain underdeveloped or are not there at all.	3.843987949410657

In such situation the person does maximum work with the help of assisting instruments or artificial organs.	3.405949636332662

Many times the loss of hands can be fulfilled with legs and the loss of legs with hands.	3.6939198134795843

The legs of many children are twisted and deformed from birth.	3.837422855085269

Attempt should be made to straighten such deformed feet as soon as possible because the bones and joints of children are soft.	3.576576871153279

Cerebral palsy is one of the deformities occurring from birth and is sufficiently dangerous.	3.5519072147987125

Due to the damage occurring in the brain some organs of the brain stop functioning.	5.28632984071242

Jaundice is a major reason of cerebral palsy.	5.208732945974833

In the state of jaundice one can be saved from this situation by giving blood to the child as soon as possible.	4.141262246344193

High fever , vommitting etc occurring in new born baby become the causes of cerebral palsy.	3.5391235793531797

Apart from this many children become victims of T.B.	4.745813754162205

The condition of cerebral palsy persists life long because there is no treatment for this.	4.303766871601631

But on the other side if correct opportunities are provided to the suffering child then to sufficient extent he can become responsible and a man of independent personality.	2.5504582109745124

In the management of child suffering with cerebral palsy the role of parents and guardian is important.	2.9252439057031516

Therefore for preparing parents for this work continuous consult and support should be given.	3.103706900170719

The guardians must be shown the way to recognize specialities of the child and to help and support them in order to fulfil their deficiencies.	3.350158384442251

There is also the need of special instruments to the child suffering with cerebral palsy.	4.4836977524374415

With these instruments the children suffering with cerebral palsy are able to do many types of work easily.	3.9097848223909453

Muscular dystrophy is one such disease in which the muscles continue becoming weak gradually.	4.127266301776889

Muscular dystrophyis of three types.	6.490796462097757

In the first type of the disease of muscular dystrophy the growth of the child occurs at first normally or a little gradually.	3.6797892786479665

When the child is of 2 - 3 years then he faces difficulty in walking , strolling , running , climbing etc.	4.00547725051189

Later on in muscular dystrophy difficulty comes in standing as well.	3.2796132375958273

After some days the child is forced to stay lying on the bed.	4.635230472051425

In the other types the rate of the muscular dystrophy disease is less or more.	3.6190249794788274

T.B.is of many types , bones and joints also become its victim.	4.019499690856112

Due to the reason of T.B.the rotation of the joints stops.	4.072091634580779

If T.B.reaches to the spinal cord then hunch comes out and paralysis may attack.	3.386023841392862

The disease of lathyrism is a disease that occurs due to excessive use of grasspea.	4.710672319751607

Grasspea is cheap and is eaten by the poor class in the large area of Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Orissa.	2.646470737933968

Due to the use of grasspea first the person feels weakness in walking and then becomes obligated to take the prop of a stick.	3.180358574071068

During to handicappedness there is much more psychological damage than the physical damage.	3.80956932084217

In fact with the information of handicappedness a very big shock is received to the person.	3.4886259650229436

If we see from the scientific point of view then all the parts of our body work independently.	3.8086558639615102

The effect of a bad or inactive organ is not seen on the other healthy organs.	3.999771658340179

There are very few such diseases which show effect on other organs together.	3.2815581732275754

Therefore it may be believed that the reproductive organs of the handicapped person would be normal.	3.811012395986275

He can keep his partner happy by using his reproductive power and can fulfil family duties.	2.7401513697671716

During pregnancy the women with damaged spinal cord may have to face various types of complications.	4.154183117099361

These complications are untimely pain , ulcer due to pressure etc.	3.77384764704632

Because of the spinal cord being damaged these women fail to feel the movement of the foetus.	3.6420184537278093

The delivery in such women is possible through foreceps and other other methods.	3.6973029555178543

There is no difficulty to deaf and dumb in walking.	3.3844788778206145

Menatlly retarded or people suffering from psychological disorders also walk easily.	3.981213565775599

There is need of training for walking to blind people and skeletally handicapped people.	2.8948740473585963

In new blind people there is huge lack of confidence.	3.985367887144624

Newly blinds become anxious on slight problem and in anxiety fail to even go for little approximation.	2.540698659654567

Therefore for such blind people the training of movement is that much essential as the learning of braille.	2.824526999622181

Blind person can recognize objects to very great extent with touch.	3.587275755860766

Blind person can estimate by touching by using hands or feet.	3.1955386410416136

Blind person can estimate many things by smelling inside or outside the home.	3.09775952783084

On the basis of smell the blind person estimates many shops , factories or offices.	2.837698561673453

When we walk then the effect of the forthcoming obstacles is seen on our muscles and joints.	3.8352566727925193

Different types of places grassy , road , sandy area or an area filled with mud puts different types of effects on the muscles and joints of our feet.	2.6157646090044904

Similarly while traveling in bus , climbing up the stairs or while opening the doors our muscles feel differently.	2.5244887967007585

On the basis of these fellings the blind can come to know of his situation and direction.	2.9733337679230476

The person with sight should stand in front of the blind person.	4.407591165545733

The blind person should hold the arm of the blind person by standing one step back.	3.0787248470356965

The skeletally challenged person also is made to learn movement.	4.697840734801467

After the sudden skeletal handicappedness where its physical capacity decreases , there its confidence also shatters.	2.495015910085006

In such while the skeletally challenged person is need of assisting instruments to move , there he also needs someone to give the right directions.	2.7002758624912078

Stick is the oldest assisting instrument in which there is the use of straight wood.	5.185401601689323

On the upper part of the stick there is one handle.	5.199848732576109

At present there is also the use of aluminium stick which is light and strong.	5.149386027254577

Below this aluminium tip there is rubber tip which keeps a good hold on the floor.	2.662950672694072

When wheels are attachd to the normal chair then it is called wheel chair.	4.092839981917641

After sitting on this chair the victim of serious handicappedness also can come up to some distance.	3.1678227831103536

Motorised wheel chair for going inside and outside of house and office are also available which have brakes as well.	2.7355681811965082

At present the complaint of contamination in things for eating and drinking are becoming common.	3.717069601906001

Ghee , oil , milk , spices and in fact in vegetables as well as the use of chemicals is a serious problem.	3.9180853556015394

Certainly by consuming contaminated things we are straight away inviting diseases.	3.2285283506069185

The chemicals mixed in these contaminated things affect our immune system directly , by which the problems of dehydration , vomiting etc may occur.	3.2075951679976296

This way by the use of substances mixed with these chemicals there is a risk of the occurrence of the diseases connected to nervous system etc.	4.111564901791299

With contaminated things not just liver , but the effect is also seen on intestines.	3.608604376602556

We can overcome this problem , provided we stay cautious.	3.6572311081062248

In order to stay away from the ill effects of contaminated food materials we must at first try to buy goods of good quality.	2.7544565936115735

An alternative from being saved from contaminated food materials may be branded items , but many times complaints may arise even in them.	2.5239086974684652

Therefore for you organic foods would be safe.	4.25448674899975

The biggest benefit of organic food products is this that no type of chemical substances can be used in them.	3.7504571451109263

On the other hand the complaint of the mixing of fruits and vegetables and the use of chemicals to ripen them is also coming forward regularly.	3.424989442472739

This may also prove harmful with respect to health.	4.978993025647631

As such from the point of view of safety you must eat the fruit after peeing them off.	2.867566967779782

Similar things you can do with vegetables as well.	4.547388395395365

Not just this , you wash fruits and vegetables many times before use , so that , more and more color on them gets washed.	2.8910042948389054

Just nutritive food is not essential , but staying cautious is also essential so that the chemicals do not go inside with nutrition in the body.	3.3940548569380176

The problem of handicappedness is ancient and the efforts of their diagnosis are also equally ancient.	2.914420395229777

The level of technical dvelopment has been having continuous influence on these efforts.	2.825561418048609

The National institute for the Visually Handicapped have developed various types of assisting instruments for various purposes.	2.8118960516969835

For the higher education of handicapped people latest braille slates , tailor 's frame , instruments to solve numericals and algebra , and kit helpful in geometry have also been prepared.	2.023305191095409

For the handicapped persons the set of pictures helpful in the study of physics have also been developed.	3.2488958197368096

With the help of all these assisting instruments related to education the blind person can read new and every type of subjects.	2.8806417718188486

For general blind persons tools for threading a needle , for shorthand etc have also been developed.	2.486548984115923

For the physical development and the entertainment of blind people many things of games have also been developed.	2.716990798641853

For the blind people the ringing balls in cricket and football etc have been developed.	3.203800585489852

Tactile chess for sitting down and playing , cards of braille , pocket frame etc have been manufactured.	2.676932560795509

For the locomotion of blind people the stick which is brought in use have also been developed.	3.2933554575335435

Although the braille script has been of support for the blind people from long time but with time improvements have come in this as well.	2.7062189001975647

The person types normal words on the computer and simultaneously the attached machine continues taking out the print in braille.	2.5992112543063177

Now in less time newspaper , letters , magazines or books can be prepared.	3.4746382614998876

Where such machines are being imported from foreign institutions there in India as well many organizations are doing research in this direction.	2.481221300852053

Voice synthesizer has also become common now and has become available in less price.	3.3973828387294067

Whatever is fed into the computer , the attached voice synthesizer reads it aloud.	2.729125069128611

Previously the blind people used to get scared with calculation and maths.	4.3682614742864505

now after the invention of voice calculator not just the anxiety of the blind people has vanished , but now they can also work at the place of calculations.	2.9090832028532483

At present in our country there is adequate arrangement of making artificial leg or calliper etc according to severed legs or weak legs.	2.536068252641964

The leg is severed below the knee or above , the artficial leg can be fixed.	2.888206527051704

similarly to whatever extent of the leg is weak or distorted the callipers can be prepared and these are very helpful.	3.298883848535923

These callipers can be worn for many years easily.	4.385973403103415

In order to make club foot straight initially and or the making of special shoes according to them is also easy.	2.3748700450995788

When the person becomes handicapped after becoming victim of a disease or accident then his treatment is done in various ways.	3.7410223989902707

Among these various types of surgical treatment , physical treatment , physiotherapy , occupational therapy etc are included.	3.056122997554133

At present to great extent benefit has been observed in various cases of polio , leprosy , accidents.	3.100915172419166

In the country there is a web of the centres of ALIMCO and Mahavir Handicapped Institute where every type of artificial organ and calliper etc are available.	2.627536868517798

Through the surgical treatment the effort of making the patients of cerebral palsy normal is ongoing.	3.7854455584588385

Due to the development in medical science the lost eye sight is retieved once again and the diseases do make the person blind.	2.828871215646864

The biggest example of this is earler people in large numbers used to become blind due to cataract.	3.0187991871393662

Now with simple surgery the treatment of cataract is done.	5.883809834388265

Through the intra occular lens the person continues to take benefit of the complete sight capacity.	2.658848358667228

At present with the surgery transparency is brought back.	4.09130765148787

In the schools through the regular treatments of children prevention is applied on the diseases of eyes and the increasing diseases are corrected.	3.4932868773929635

In various cases when the person starts living his life after considering himself blind then with the surgery of cornea he starts seeing.	2.8364777544858666

Organisations like Mahavir Vikalang Sahayata Samiti have provided artificial organs to people by visiting villages and investigating on large scale.	2.170631106453022

Similarly in such camps the surgery of cataract of the eyes of people has been done successfully.	4.227682219601546

One more solution of the diagnosis of the problem of handicappedness is this that so much facilities and concessions should be given to the handicapped people so that there could be sufficient compensation to the losses occurring due to physical disabilities.	3.333177620735316

According to the order issued by the Railway Ministry blind people , physically challenged , deaf - dumb and mentally retarded people would get 75 percent concession on the fares of first class , second class and sleeper class.	1.902115756404078

Also in season ticket the handicapped people get 50 percent concession.	3.9281008207317862

Besides this different aids programs are also run through district rehabilitation centres , regional rehabilitation centres.	2.5127527840269455

Trachoma disease gets spreading through the dirty hands , polluted towels etc..	3.3971570035902356

Flies also play an important role in spreading trachoma disease.	4.15249968880105

Trachoma disease is more in those areas where poor people live and there is a plethora of dust.	4.303483968081357

The areas having a lack of water also have trachoma in plenty.	4.171485907749604

Open and dirty toilets , open sewers , twittering of the flies also increase the number of trachoma disease.	2.9460525679633305

Due to the disease of trachoma the eyes also get reddened.	4.844756051064864

In such situation it is essential to keep the eyes clean.	5.495546170589578

Cola can give rise to gas related problems.	5.381523201427477

Contaminated water or vapor rich water has ill effects on digestive system.	3.601898723672953

These days due to gas , bile and phlegm separately or by the combination of two or all the three several types of disease must be arising.	2.97528416267946

Therefore in monsoon season fire must be safeguarded cautiously.	3.788419777096956

Due to the subduction of fire there are lethal consequences on health.	2.93480731600653

Due to the deformation of fire the person suffers from many types of disease.	3.42570080823531

The disease is not eliminated by medicnes.	5.624245664075776

One symptom of the complication gets suppressed and becomes the reason of another disease.	4.251396046526477

The body tries for its own defense.	4.667229102423392

The nature tries comprehensively to remove the dirt present in the body.	4.361194161184967

Naturopathy helps in removing and throwing away this dirt from our body.	3.079320362829269

Naturopathy makes the person healthy , strong and full of glow.	4.380215295004741

Fast , juice , fruits , balanced diet natural lifestyle are helpful in naturopathy.	4.180579288901469

With the method of air , sunlight - water , massage , exercise , pranayam any disease is destroyed from the root.	3.4806729050278964

State clearly that you want food cooked in steam or you want deep fried , fried , cooked at high temperature or roasted food.	1.837253285574351

Like in the villages as pollution arises in the drains and streets of villages disease is produced due to them.	2.8079610370031145

Likewise dirt is accumulated in the body.	6.2550093382757685

This dirt of the body can not be excreted through the medium of toilet , urine sweat etc and starts percolating inside.	4.190142586201814

That dirt of the body is the root of all the diseases.	7.063168528756702

If your disease is not able to be rectified by any medicine then get a new life by adopting new natural treatment.	3.531847835980732

Health is natural and disease is unnatural.	5.249482823791016

When we follow the rules of body and life then the health is natural.	3.9411383443845356

When we ignore the rules of body and life , overlook then the disease is unnatural.	4.265217275813628

The normal reaction of the normal situation of life force is health and abnormal reaction is disease.	3.3523771794170103

This condition of abnormal reaction is the reason of disease alone.	5.315124207277655

Therefore we can say that those symptoms because of which the situations of disease are produced they should be corrected.	4.108521379247846

No effort should be taken in order to suppress the symptoms through traditional contemporary method and medicines.	3.8748923865447757

The excess pressure of traditional treatment stays on treatment.	3.962730730323852

Traditional treatment method does not rely on the philosophy of staying free of disease.	2.926010809487082

We know that for the treatment of disease traditional treatment method has left no stone unturned in every possible research.	3.064502135976086

The treatment of disease depends on the basis as to in what form do we take our disease.	3.7508796704738776

There is immense attack on the body in the form of medicine , injection etc.	4.8708435814253725

By that action procedure the patient becomes disease free , this is the general belief among people.	3.726486857361623

On the basis of this wrong belief the use of all types of medicines are used on the diseases.	4.056714837286672

That is simple cough and cold or dangerous cancer disease.	4.299910606930315

The nature tries to maintain balance in the body.	4.497330334455054

In the human body health and disease are two separate self religions in the human body.	3.008898061959564

మానవ శరీరంలో ఆరోగ్యం మరియు రోగం రెండు భిన్నమైన స్వయంధర్మాలు.	12.670329882248849

But it definitely lays stress on the fact that by understanding the creative process of nature dependent rules certainly the people suffering with dangerous diseases can be helped.	2.4667821642149774

The fact is that at present the extent to which people have the knowledge of destructive forces that much less they have the knowledge about the process of life force.	3.312046651364529

In the natural treatment the treatment is done of the patient and not of the disease.	5.54714590910348

On the occurrence of disease for the treatment of disease it is important to stick to the rules of health and essential to stay away from the habits which produce disease , matter and diet which produce the same.	3.425872248377198

By abiding by the rules of health only all types of diseases are cured.	3.919475407230304

By following the rules of health the treatment of the dangerous disease like cancer also is possible in the present times.	3.87059928221639

For the treatment of disease adopt any where and any type of method.	4.149159462072419

Eat medicines , but if you do not restricy yourself in food habits then the disease would not be corrected.	4.4752050848900735

Someone consumes alcohol , is in the habit of smoking cigarette , bidi and his liver has become infectious , is suffering from rheumatism , arthritis , psyctic disease etc.	2.999510880605831

For these diseases the person eats different types of medicines.	4.6810281378655825

Natural treatment is also done.	9.324896735744476

But if they do not quit alcohol , cigarette , bidi etc then one can not get rid of the disease.	4.845857206876695

By spending money of lacs and crores one can not free oneself of disease , till the time one does not follow the rules of health.	2.87294843111146

Natural treatment is proud that the treatment of all types of diseases is possible in natural treatment.	4.560522411572083

If the person will get the treatment done and do not quit the habits leading to disease , then is its treatment possible ? 	3.1944886351718247

This is also true that if the person gets the treatment done by staying in any natural hospital , where he is given diet and treatment under strict vigilence.	2.8077050652003925

The bad habits of the patient are removed with strictness.	6.072662743068649

In that duration of staying in hospital it is natural to get relief.	3.9370994101482197

After coming back from the hospital again old habits , eating habits , and the rules of healthy life style are left , then again there is attack of the diseases.	3.033174412011733

The nature has given immense power to every living being to stay disease free.	2.811254727868082

In order to rid us from diseases modern scientific development makes us aware of the behavioural and non destructive enriched energy of the nature.	2.4309374126340373

If once you become complete by the nature and follow its rules then you would always appear healthy and full of lively youth.	2.4825524360255953

In order to maintain health balanced diet , self control , yoga and exercise are essential.	3.0648408265471714

Good health is ultimate bliss.	6.5804626387046445

The only key to health is the regular following of decided balanced diet by the diet specialists , and yogasana by the yoga specialists.	2.549368927793173

The secret to long life is in this only.	4.2736697797500085

Not just long leaf , also of good health and youthful life.	3.6929206185825127

It would be very justified to call the modern age as the pollution age , because at every step there is pollution.	2.585300398441129

Iron and steel industries , aviation , motor and railways , deafness of the ears due to the noise of loud - speakers etc , disorder of blood circulation , irritation due to staying in tension , beating of the heart , increase of blood pressure , diseases like cancer etc.	2.8142409820251095

Diseases like tuberculosis , cancer , influenza , asthma , of throat and trachea etc are occuring due to the poisonous gases of motor cars and iron and steel industries and the spreading of pesticide chemicals in the plants in the fields.	2.371500127635896

The residents of those places where the atmosphere is covered with viruses , dust , smoke , moisture , fog and cloud are found to be suffering from tuberculosis , cancer , nervous weakness , rheumatism , blood disorders etc.	2.2326699430348955

The effluents of poisonous pesticides , plastic , dye , and the factories of rubber the dirty drains of the city and the poisonous substances of chemical fertilizers are polluting the sources of water and the diseases like diarrhoea , piles and of skin are spreading.	2.2399357472148007

In the pollution of the earth flies , mosquites and many harmful pests are being produced and are inviting the diseases like tuberculosis , gastritis , tetanus , yellow fever , malaria , dysentery , diorrhoea , cancer etc.	2.185100616611961

The edible items produced with chemical fertilizers make men and animals suffer from lethal diseases like cancer etc.	2.5434084288090433

The use of various types of chemicals on plants and cereals produce many types of dangerous diseases after reaching in our body.	3.334322031815426

Due to the use of wrong utensils also the food items become poisonous.	3.899466538673872

Contamination by greedy businessmen and the use of saccharine in drinking items make the civilized men suffer from dangerous diseases.	2.805910700131549

There is more expenditure of life - force in digesting more food and elimination of disorders produced due to them.	3.1697488072996176

By this its loss becomes definite.	5.28819468507443

One is required to work in order to lead life.	6.2563775775428025

But rest is essential on getting tired.	4.839450205265798

Wandering uselessly , without any aim , tiring the one 's body is foolishness only and also with it there is also the reduction of life - force.	3.48318206457132

Work is life , worklessness is death.	5.233776882164641

Flowing water is pure , but the water standing at one place only produces foul smell.	3.042449967916264

The brain of lazy , the house of disease.	4.726922508137689

Like due to not using the motor - car it gets rusted.	3.9778127870749045

Due to working till late at night or partying or passing the entire night keeping awake wastage of life force is essential.	2.801492757292117

Due to keeping awake till late at night one can become the victim of mental disorder and sleeplessness etc.	3.676124601676997

According the view of Prof.A.Clark all our curing medicines are poison and as a result every dose of medicine reduces the life - force of the patient.	2.5455213669772423

Allopathy suppresses the diseases with medicines and produces poisonous situation in the body.	3.587944084128492

The destruction of life force starts with the use of medicines.	5.5805571392194535

The body continues to grow continuously for approximately upto 25 - 30 years.	3.5787864844469923

The work of intelligence and construction is also finished in this period only.	2.987701618244483

Those men and women who destroy semen and menses in unnatural way , there is no production of glaze , fame , revolution , intelligence and strength.	3.108744785531776

Because of being extremely weak many dangerous diseases may be produced in men and women.	3.5045077780113814

According to medical science one drop of semen is produced by 40 drops of blood.	2.959284710564735

According to Ayurveda one drop of semen is produced by 80 drops of blood.	3.1320579684945793

In order to remove foreign particles accumulated in the intestines and to increase the power of the intestines the use of anima is done.	4.18857466895576

For anima generally the quantity of water is from 500 m.l.To 1500 m.l.	4.2990922955213255

This quantity of water is also dependent on the acceptance of the patient.	4.86989856023346

The quantity of water which the patient can retain in his intestine , only that much of water he should be allowed to take.	3.358639630537007

There are many methods of taking anima.	5.2128136722888385

In one condition after lying flat and leaving the abdomen region loose both the knees are folded upwards.	2.5938221729868984

In the second condition by lying on the left side the right leg should be folded from the knee.	3.7841774702098885

The pot of anima should be kept three feet above the bench.	4.263163672714596

Fill warm water in the pot.	10.582386361333254

Before taking anima some water is removed from the nozzle so that the air in the tube comes out.	3.4262383468110733

By putting vaseline or oil in the catheter of the nozzle is entred in the anus gradually.	3.3067234237484127

After taking anima one should lie down on the left and right or should take light walk , due to which the excreta gets dissolved in the water completely.	3.4717685124078774

On going to the toilet while excreting the excreta should be allowed to come out on its own.	3.5358465598260302

There is no need of taking special effort.	4.631758288857517

It is not essential that in one go the bowel gets cleared.	3.5517753092487605

For this before anima soil is put on the stomach and afterwards bath is taken only upto the waist.	3.368611422537195

On the formation of excess gas lemon is added in water.	3.8654726073020176

Neem water , honey water is given specially in intense excreta obstruction.	3.4932106409239285

What is balanced diet ? 	9.231089890162364

Form food the only aim of man is not just to fill stomach , gain health or fulfil taste , but also to bring about mind , character and spiritual growth.	2.520598989344347

The interest of man towards various types of foods is the symbol of his conduct and recognition.	3.268795636984096

Therefore in food the consumption of those types of foods should be done which is helpful in physical , mental , principle , social and spiritual enhancement.	3.54477227231679

Balanced diet develops love , affection , friendship , forgiveness , tenderness , non violence peace etc properties.	2.5121339703337506

Grow the feeling of respect and honor toward the humans.	4.007013791927587

Those foods in which there is no fulfillment of the above mentioned things and the consequences come the opposite instead , that food can not be called balanced.	3.4808926857802236

What type is nutritive diet ? 	6.614330973457947

In the food the eleme  nts providing energy , strength and heat to the body like proteins , glucose , fat , minerals , vitamins etc should be present in proper ratio and sufficient quantity.	2.5882436773328514

Due to which the growth of good cells in the body continues to take place.	5.656439414076408

According to one 's own financial ability , the selection of those substances may be done depending on the likeness and availabilty and personal necessity from the substances of various categories.	2.3528677312286397

Nutritive substances are also present in vegetarian food materials.	5.708182676537759

Today many doctors and people consider consuming nonvegetarian food for protein and calorie due to misleading advertisements.	2.4613380489491274

But in many vegetarian food materials also protein , calorie , vitamins and nutritive substances are available in sufficient quantity.	3.1343099957581884

In nonvegetarian items the outer part of pulses , cereals etc there is no quantity of fiber present at all.	3.3942113258520177

This has been ascertained by the scientists that fiber has a lot of importance in preventing diseases.	3.511758776790068

Vitamins are also essential for our health.	4.821729196402954

The source of these vitamins are vegetable substances only.	3.880955800115242

The main source of food for animals and humans is the food obtained by agriculture or plants.	2.9478056617545545

The proteins which are found in meat , those also are obtained from plants alone.	3.7703410395886094

Therefore getting nutrition directly from vegetable substances is better than from that secondary nutrition which in animal meat has also been obtained from vegetable substances.	2.6239345877857954

Some people spread this rumor that egg is a complete nutrition.	3.8004155501183687

Vitamin - C , carbohydrates and fiber are not found at all in eggs.	3.8179638616177396

Egg , meat , fish etc are acidic food due to which there is removal of calcium from the bones and due to this type of loss occurring of calcium it takes longer for the bone to rejoin after fracture.	2.9922803424854303

There is also more cholesterol in eggs.	5.3069843811163375

Any type of toxic substance can not arise in balanced diet prepared by mixing fruits , green vegetables , various types of lentils , seeds and milk.	2.8750379244578608

Its main reason is that when an animal dies then it becomes dead substance.	3.8099564281480864

This does not apply to vegetables.	5.874094869175381

If any vegetable is cut even half and its half part is put inside the ground then it will grow again in the form of vegetable or tree.	2.8940411337199907

This is possible only because vegetable is a living substance.	3.7404702843659474

This thing can not be said for a lamb , goat or chicken.	4.265486005059028

From the other special sources it has been found this that when an animal is killed then it becomes afraid and the toxic substance released due to fear sprears in his body.	2.519275878652931

That same toxic substance reaches the body of those people in the form of meat who eat them.	4.884148594215533

Our body is not completely capable of excreting all those toxic substances.	3.8239498042447653

The acid base balance is essential in food.	4.459499940528544

Many doctors believe that the reason of disease in body is the imbalance of acid-base.	4.7350470996781135

But in our food attention is not paid on the ratio of acid - base.	3.610147589510746

But in the present times due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the consumption of cereals and vegetables without washing them properly and with peels may also become the reason of harm because of some part of poison remaining in them.	3.2968997950698804

The aim of saying is this only that instead of giving importance to one sided thought with respect to food , we should take decision after thinking on every side with multiple point of view as per the weather and physical needs.	2.4991232168534587

But in no case the natural doctrines of Nature should be ignored.	3.0343395502451975

According to Chinese Panch Tatva doctrines various tastes have relations with different organs of the body.	2.5515674686883214

Natural doctors have such beliefs that liver and pancreas are affected by sour taste.	3.1159549846845502

Hot taste has relation with lungs and large intestine.	4.068586521864483

Sweet taste has direct relation with spleen and gall bladder.	3.783447822554811

The heart and small intestines etc are affected by bitter taste.	3.8259194536554824

With these tastes not just our organs get affected but the nutrition of these organs also take place.	2.961380189199296

The doctors consider the balance of taste in foood alone as the base of health.	3.3436651512277096

The doctors treat by balancing various tastes.	4.484894311814743

The food should be according to the weather.	5.743404297752354

Those food materials which are obtained maximum from the nature in that month , is generally considered to be good from the point of view of health.	2.9858155619787565

Maximum birds - animals which do not accumulate food and lead a carefree life lead there life on the basis of available fruits , leaves alone.	2.630494135157723

The nature gives complete support in order to keep each person healthy.	3.9564215609974633

All the animals eat only those things , which is available around them.	3.8695761088551226

Animals do not import food materials from other places.	3.8730806371152093

The laws of nature are equal for every one poor and rich.	3.2110628164172605

Therefore the consumption of expensive , unseasonal , imported food material is always useful for health , is completely false.	3.057010263873381

Balanced diet itself does the work of medicine.	5.4979995206575

Such is the belief of dieticians that the relation of maximum physical diseases is due to food related ill habits , carelessness and inattentiveness.	2.6240056998145027

The high blood pressure affects the activity of blood purification after contracting the blood vessels.	4.292354022378909

After its permanence the purification of blood becomes abnormal and becomes the reason of the infection of kidney and other disorders.	3.956867377520815

Since through the knidney the adverse substances for the body are removed daily post digestion through the urinary passage.	3.0701655941058683

But due to abnormal activity these substances return to the body again and make the body poisonous and become the reason of kidney failure.	3.623593369285809

The increased pressure for long duration enhances the pressure in the blood vessel which take the blood to the retina and may even tear them.	3.2646606708536674

Due to which the blood secretion occuring on the body may take away the eye - sight permanently.	4.1754152666088515

With the increase of age the blood vessels lose the property of their flexibiity after becoming stiff.	3.8003253221986286

These stiff vessels are called vessel stiffness.	4.751175714083808

Due to these very arteries the high blood pressure create more dangers and make the situation extremely serious and damages heart , brain , kidney.	2.835878837087256

Due this very difficulty of artery some it also weakens the feet.	3.178166126854293

On blood donation the body compensates for the donated blood with the formation of the new blood withing 24 hours to a week.	2.8132076870422984

There is nothing to excite about blood donation.	4.4396163472959165

A healthy person 's body generally has an amount of about 5 - 6 litres of blood.	3.653089628517903

You donate only 1  20 part of it.	5.64887461307583

A person who is afflicted with jaundice , malaria , sexual disease , AIDS , hemophilia , anemia , toxicity etc.is not eligible to donate blood.	2.563670978535049

As much as possible one should avoid taking the blood of a profession blood donater.	3.3338782771032216

Because he is donating his blood due to his poverty , not on the basis of humanity.	3.608118471444555

His blood might lack the total elements as per the standards.	3.9186283659998358

Due to frequent blood donation , such a person might be weak and afflicted with different kinds of disease , out of which some can even be deadly such as jaundice , AIDS etc.	2.7803973463028013

The amount of iron in the person donating blood frequently might be much less than that of a healthy person.	3.7640836038801773

Because such a person keeps on donating blood prior to the time of donating blood again due to economic compulsions.	3.2461307512812767

Because of not taking nutritive food many types of diseases can occur to blood donator person.	3.929399237048877

Only when the use of blood is very essential then only blood donation should be done because on the occurrence of slight carelessness and reaction the life of the patient can go.	4.241292575277215

It is compulsory to carry out the tests for HIV , Hepatitis-B and C , Malaria and VDRL before blood donation.	2.6879168462257366

Learn the difference between cholestrol and fat.	5.653027354174301

Fat can alone increase your weight but cholestrol alone can not increae your weight.	2.7902015432625222

In 9 out of 10 people the reason behind obesity is the presence of both the fat and the cholestrol.	4.241710312416733

When the cholestrol is in the body in normal quantity then it plays an important role in keeping the artries of the heart healthy.	4.392337130190263

It is very important for health that the cholestrol be in normal quantity.	3.7880441118214323

It is produced in the liver of our body by the nature.	6.283328039994287

If there is too much cholestrol in the body then it leads to the disease ` Aeksklerosis '.	4.784375194677964

In the ` Aeksklerosis ' disease , a wax-like substance is secreted in the artries which makes them very narrow.	2.850945834849372

Due to this wax-like substance blood is not able to flow properly which leads to heart attack.	3.4144815671928006

HDL cholestrol is a high density lipoprotein.	5.525044794785916

Its job is to clear the way of the blood flow such that the work of the heart mechanism goes on smoothly.	4.555980540484559

We can call HDL cholestrol the good cholestrol.	4.1280167761386775

LDL cholestrol is a low density lipoprotein.	5.498426740020553

LDL cholestrol accumulates in the artries by combining with the fat which causes obstacle in the flow of the blood.	3.7064367472892346

Due to the obstacle in the blood flow , there is a danger of heart disease.	6.045135285629674

We can call LDL cholestrol the bad cholestrol.	4.521080415419616

Vegetable fat is unsaturated lipid.	6.665919466858378

Because of vegetable ghee and the process of organic hydrogenation , vegetable oil takes the solid form in the room temperature.	3.0246416244815326

Vegetable fat is not so harmful as saturated fat.	4.530971888819372

As far as obesity is concerned both kinds of fat increases obesity.	3.309954325861649

Animal fat the fat found in all kinds of meat and milk products comes under this category.	3.6482191220933133

Animal fat is saturated fat , which means that it becomes solid from liquid at room temperature.It increases the fat cells of our body which leads to increase in the weight.	3.015716981668393

Animal fat , along with the bad cholestrol , reduces the blood flow towards the mind and the heart.	4.722896229428862

If you want to remain healthy then before having your food first see how much is the quantity of the cholestrol and the fat.	3.1078488977404555

Endocrine glands have a very important place in our body.	4.957736646038547

When endocrine glands secrete in enough quantity then our helath remains perfect but in case of the opposite our health malfunctions hence it is compulsory for us to keep them healthy under any condition.	2.6593413007145124

Because of these endocrine glands someone is found to be extremely small , some tall , some fat and some absolutely thin.	2.9763222106011042

Eunuchs are also the result of the abnormality of these endocrine glands.	4.597569665184194

Sometimes you would have seen hairs on the face of the girls and boys without moustache and beards and would have heard of sex change all this is the result of the abnormality of the endocrine glands.	2.7729352562984233

It is clear from all this that secretion of the endocrine glands keep a balance on our mental development , internal and external activities and behavior etc..	2.481335667833411

The hormone secreting from the pancreat gland is insulin.	3.6672911742222336

Pancreat gland keeps a control over the quantity of insulin.	6.020207972931506

When the body has excessive glucose then the secretion of insulin converts into glucose and due to the lack of insulin diabetes occurs.	3.3690278921372294

Thyroid glands are of the shape of the shield and they are situated in the throat on the both sides of the trachea.	4.09810264603874

The hormone secreted from thyroid glands is called thyroxin and it controls the growth of the body and the rate of the heart beat.	4.28546410770341

It is helpful in proper usage of carbohydrate.	5.797324332595069

In case of deficiency of glucose in the body the secretion of thyroxin helps in the formation of glucose by separating carbohydarte from other substances and controls the quantity of calcium.	3.8537392495206464

In case of throxin becoming over-active phosphate along with calcium is lost from the bone and it begins to come in excretion and consequently the bones become thin and weak.	2.3665291706553213

Parathroids are four in number and they are situated attached to the throid glands.	3.670669807697701

The hormone secrted in it helps in keeping the optimum quantity of calcium and phosphate in the blood.	3.8029684103489734

Its deficiency lead to tetanus , calcium deficiency and increase in phosphorous.	3.714291541039769

The secretion of liver and stomach removes the deficiency of blood.	4.685076738788162

The secretion of liver and stomach increases the red blood cells in the blood.	4.8814714012820515

Adrenal gland is also called suprarenal gland it is near the kidneys.	4.49158496666376

Every gland has two parts.	7.4902870675696045

The outer part is called adrenal cortex and the inner part is called adrenal almedula.	3.4275138048114258

The secretion of the outer part of the bordering kidney has a great importance.	4.370243833292309

The removal of outer part by operation causes immediate death.	3.458558112127011

The outer part is essential for life.	5.825933761806297

The sexual feelings are balanced by these hormones.	4.371381220839398

Due to more secretion than required untimely sexual development takes place.	3.0658565535714106

For example periods and complete development of sexual organs in 2-4 years old girls.	3.4060877559497875

Testes in the males and ovaries in the females are present in the form of sexual glands.	4.711654240367212

We call the juice secreted by these sex glands the sex hormone and it is this which gives maleness to the males and femaleness to the females.	2.643121811471233

Pituitary gland is the part of the brain itself and it is very small in size.	5.72486551925889

Several types of hormones are produced by the pituitary gland.	4.5014762844485485

It is because of these hormones that the hormones secreted by the rest of the glands is produced in the right qunatity and their work is completely controlled.	3.452276112177671

It is very necessary for the normal development.	6.840375401921462

These hormones are very helpful in removing the dwarfism.	5.795501831237926

The elements that develops then is produced in the front part of the pituitary gland.	4.985833314030455

The secretion of these glands is chemical and their work is also to produce chemical effect.	2.9386851699385517

Taking bath in cold water leads to the formation and the secretion of hormones within the body on time and in proper form.	3.7897138335753797

Use of fresh pure cold water is helpful in their secretion.	4.642958570317707

Therefore in order to improve the chemical work of these glands , we should take the complete chemical elements obtained by unripe food whether you take it in the form of water by taking the juice or just the unripe food in itself.	2.773402767618356

Because of the use of cold water the glands secrete properly by becoming strong and fired up.	3.3476070941662646

The property of unripe food is also cold and that of acidic ripe potato hot.	3.261879672451945

Therefore unripe food is necessary for the proper development and secretion of these glands.	4.491356140612179

Sufficient secretion by Pineal gland leads to proper secretion and development of sexual glands and it is also helpful in the mental development.	3.83115491645525

Because of the proper secretion of thymous gland , sexual maturity comes on time.	2.8894545154527083

It is necessary to know about the deficiency signs of the endocrine glands so that the related glands could be fired up.	3.0071044573133734

When absorption and release process of carbohydrate could not take place completely due to the deficiency of insulin then diabetes occurs.	3.3503001879711523

In case of deficiency of thyroxin , along with obesity and goitre , the absorption of iron could not take place sufficently.	2.9931775765240274

In case of deficiency of secretion by the sexual gland , there is a lack of maleness and femaleness.	3.6107476853661367

In case of deficiency of secretion by pituitary gland , alongwith dwarfism , strength also diminishes and complete inaction could even lead to death.	2.1913521825006987

In case of deficiency of secretion by pineal gland , there is an untimely development of sexual maturity and there is an improper mental development.	3.3801076719577283

In case of deficiency of secretion by thymous gland the development of sexual organs is not proper and complete.	3.1229575888381524

In case of deficiency of secretion by the adrenal gland , the life force diminishes and in complete inaction could even lead to death.	2.4246467568039867

In this way the proper understanding of the indications caused by the deficiency of secretion is very helpful in removing the deficiency.	3.6435812905929565

Cytica is a disease of nerves.	10.494596182660482

In the inner portion of the body , cytica nerve is a long nerve in comparison to the others.	4.85269746456405

Coming out of the lower end of the spine , it has gone towards the leg from behind the ankles.	4.5401415239109655

The pain which it causes is called cytica.	4.304575384008106

This pain originates at the back and sometimes spread till the toe of the leg.	3.8579994967834423

But generally the pain is caused by the part of this very nerve.	5.658366392154422

It is always limited at the back side.	5.169756515898202

The pain of cytica is very painful and it can be compared to the pain of the toothache.	4.036365619259799

This disease generally remains from several weeks to several months and in difficult circumstamces it can carry on till several years.	2.397407827998677

Cytica occurs due to cold , residence in damp place , paralysis of the muscles and constipation etc..	4.119858116106967

When due to these reasons the blood flow becomes poisonous and the cytica nerve becomes agitated by this poison and swelling appears in it then this disease appears.	3.0087872886750513

Therefore in many areas cytica is called a kind of neuritis.	4.637521363604942

Sometimes as a result of an injury to the lower portion of the spine the cytic nerve is affected causing this disease.	3.725893762789644

It is said that this condition arises by standing or walking for a long time , bending suddendly , picking up heavy weight etc..	2.8260359300839237

In cytica disease it is extremely important to make the patient healthy along with the local treatment.	4.632229106913235

For this it is specially important to pay attention towards the methodology.	4.382565440435046

But now because of the emergence of different diseases and allergies by the use of artificial resources , people have begun to give importance to the natural alternative.	3.096767167501481

It is necessary to give special attention towards the formation of acid-accumulation in the patient 's body.	4.112127866091562

In many situations this disease appears bcause of the decrease in acid.	3.6492489492653486

If one can fast one day before the treatment then the patient is sufficiently benefitted.	4.153940368624775

In all the old diseases one should fast in some form.	3.650834257443392

The body gets cleansed by fasting.	5.783174604520514

Other dietary methods are similar to mental weakness.	4.658482060791877

How natural are the beauty products ?.	5.989124856950309

Nature is not just the beauty source but also a big source of beauty products.	3.8423699128629187

We get such natural things from it which increases the beauty of our skin and hair as well as eliminates their diseases.	3.2910677879499253

Our body has the wonderful capacity to absorb the beneficial effects of these herbs.	3.233622100189653

Their speciality is that they do n't have any negative or harmful effects on the body.	3.6597345853551624

India 's famous and internationally recognized beauty specialist Shahnaz Hussain believes that ` Ako prepared by the vegetation and herbs has a very important place in the area of beauty industry.	2.737804236198267

They along with keeping the skin clean also nourishes them.	3.6763223768575886

It increase the blood flow and brings glow to the skin.	4.376930355652947

It also makes the skin free of diseases.	4.9520245509743015

Today beauty products made of artificial chemicals in the form of beauty materials is quite popular.	3.9572101095087193

In the cities and towns artificial face cream , shampoo , remover , hair oil etc are used in abundance.	3.0581213046847946

But due to the emergence of different diseases and allergies people have now begun to give importance to the natural alternative.	3.019289595584495

A lot of beauty products are now being sold in the market in the name of ` natural '.	4.104447116483415

Are they really natural ?.	9.094997560836024

Generally this question is a mystery for the consumers.	4.060595282446457

If we take a look at the advertisements then it is so that in the name of ` natural ' and ` herbal ' mostly chemical products are being sold.	3.56980136352952

Generally instead of taking the ready made herbal or natural beauty products available in the market if we prepare it in the home in consultation with a qualified herbal specialist then it is better.	3.104979189213739

Although in the busy life this is definitely a little difficult for every woman or man yet it is the best.	3.001724370183268

Some dependable herbal beauty products could be used.	4.767737519073041

Among these products like Shazema , Shalife , Shasilk , Shaleshm , Shabright , Shaclean , Shamlo , Shataj , etc are quite popular.	2.321847524830393

For hair specially Shaneem , Shacare , Shahair , Shahina , Shatone , Shamla etc are famous.	2.653148884192787

Even Shahnaz Hussain does not give guarantee about her products.	3.6636903689262783

She says that the way there is a reaction on the skin by the use of artifical products , in the same way there could be a harmful reaction from the products made up of herbs.	4.109464063326732

But there is no reduction in the effectiveness of the products because of our dependence on the nature.	3.5816474248226027

It is also good to forget.	6.1961015732530225

In the lives of all of us there are many moments worth forgetting.	4.10740454978093

It would have happened with you that some name might have been there in your mind but that does not come to your tongue.	2.9035028223518435

Sometime you forget after keeping the keys somewhere.	4.508483768276223

It is believed by the zoologists that even behind this incomplete memory of the humans also there is a motive.	3.189636836730111

Some people are unwavering in their belief that if we want a permanent impression of knowledge then it is necessary that our memory be incomplete.	2.902259893597384

If we could remember everything at the conscious level then we would go crazy.	2.8827901195078587

Everything would have gone awry by the memory of smaller events , therefore it is good that we remember only the important things.	2.7590314138989647

Healthy mind exists in a healthy body.	5.744873863854401

There is no kind of condition with Reiki , but even we are here shedding light on the non-vegetarian food and intoxication.	2.5962709904300914

It is extremely important that you do n't keep any kind of guilt-feeling in your mind.	4.803616868889473

In such a situation person will be able to use Reiki only for one 's own health , will not be able to help anyone else.	3.212588277666699

Because how can an ill body help someone else.	3.6408365276193497

On the basis of life-energy there is no difference in the body of humans and animals.	5.061915672951955

The principal elements of life-energy are air , sun , water and earth.	3.3355261108403806

This life-force is comletely balanced in the plants and trees.	3.6805813774986453

This life-force could taken visibly in the form of food.	4.663907236862945

Plants , vegetables and cereals are the natural reserves of these forces.	3.44165055117379

This life-force reserve remains present in them for quite a long time , even after they are cooked.	3.3083269907860853

This way when the person eats vegetables , etc , pulses and cereals then he takes in the visibly available life-force present in them.	2.408060448471578

That is why it is living food.	4.638024378196608

Besides this when we are in a condition of fear , anxiety , conflict , prejudice then bio-chemical changes happen in our body which spreads in our body in the form of poison.	3.512891750147053

This poison affects our body with different kinds of diseases.	4.931511306883432

Similarly when a person kills an animal for food then at that time that animal is overpowered by fear and bio-chemical changes happen in his whole body very quickly.	2.354325053541352

This poison in the form of chemical spreads in his whole body.	4.650024511295836

This chemical , because of fear , shock and pain is produced in larger quantity.	4.2269791742153915

The person who eats this meat eats this poison as well and takes the negative force in the visible form along with.	2.453588078852157

This force in future slowly begins to show its negative impact on the body and the person becomes affected with many diseases.	4.3116603017715045

The consciousness present in the plants is completely different from the consciousness found in the animals.	4.598640178426879

The life force which is necessary for the food of humans that humans get in visible form in vegetables , cereals and pulses.	2.9964500731053962

Intoxication first of all affects the mind and inspires the emotions buried into the unconscious mind to come out.	3.161873249536694

The buried emotions could be also of love , could be also of hate.	3.112997603681859

The person begins to behave abnormally due to intoxication because he no longer has control over his mind.	2.5669823416052746

The person can even become violent because of intoxication.	4.050417194438129

Intoxication always ends in mental depression itself.	4.83144570288804

The effect of intoxication is always negative on the body.	4.053706326778966

Slowly the important parts of body goes on becoming inoperable.	5.384985711415646

The main element of solar plexus is fire and liquor which itself is a fire element completely destroys the solar plexus.	2.5940181205084714

Along with heart chakra closes by shrivelling which in itself is a fearsome situation.	3.0254709364745502

Whether intoxication is of liquor or some other intoxicant material , the result is of simialr kind.	3.135762966653812

Similarly the intoxication of cigarrette , biri is also of the same kind , whose consequences are not good.	3.098142529028057

Slowly solar plexus begins to shrivel which gives rise to many stomach related problems.	3.193530542890108

The smoke coming out of cigarrette slowly keeps on obstructing the aura.	3.754688893648424

Therefore for good health and being a good Reiki channel it is best to keep away from the intoxication.	3.4629791822298115

The person should take oath to leave the intoxication which will be an indication of good will power.	2.9220830077234763

Sugar , sweets , chocolate , bottled  packeted drinking material are prepared by different chemicals.	3.2500045686009957

These edible materials prepared by different kinds of chemicals is dangerous for our health.	4.056643782555808

There is no nutrition in these edible materials at all.	3.4548555850002436

In the race for modernity the level of knowledge has come so low that people have made these products an inseparable part of their life.	2.4809521102966037

Sugar is a kind of acid because it is prepared with the help of acid itself.	5.169316186065016

This acid produces many kinds of diseases in our body.	5.428015077048826

Among which the principal ones are ulcer , arthritis , problems of kidney , skin disease , insomnia and disinterest towards the study of children etc.	2.6132803901748898

Those people who have mental depression and epilepsy they should shun sugar and products made up of sugar.	3.14533739901625

There are twenty spoonful of sugar in one square of chocolate.	3.6910759580089603

In the same way are the packaged food items , they also give only diseases to us.	3.050536262399785

A kind of chemical MSG-Monosodium or aginomoto is mixed in the packaged food which has the capacity to keep the food for more days.	3.286425592347529

The packaged food gives invitation to many diseases.	4.0228754140765455

This chemical affects our nervous system the most which stops the mental development of children , headache , mental depression and pain in the neck are there.	3.2003068358426034

Although in the west people have almost shunned milk , but in India milk has remained the synonym for good health.	2.4839347300386643

Therefore any argument against it would not be acceptable to the common man.	3.686141676626483

Even though it is important to tell in its relation that the milk of animal is meant for the animals.	3.247330492889262

A child can drink one 's mother 's milk till the age of three years.	4.24147454103668

Because till the age of three years those chemicals rennin and lactose are there in the child 's body which could digest the milk.	3.5206771592448227

That is it dissolves the element Casein that is found in the milk.	4.283147687415652

But after the age of three years these chemicals rennin and lactose end automatically and then the element casein found in the milk is not able to get digested and slowly keeps on accumulating in the intestine.	3.1552634631045646

In order to clean up this material mucous is created in large quantity and slowly it gives rise to many diseases.	2.877717947818288

If you are suffering from diseases like tonsil , bronchitis then immediately stop the milk.	3.5731604963925823

In reality the calcium found in the milk is itself the main reason behind many diseases.	4.323563897464684

The large quantity of phosphorous in milk forces the blood to extract calcium from the healthy bones and teeth of the body.	3.2355957824601203

The calcium found in the milk produces an excess of calcium in the blood which creates tumor , cataract , stone in the kidneys and gall bladder.	3.2918073876717653

The calcium found in the milk gives rise to common diseases like problems of bones , spondilitis , sciatica , etc.	3.221663856062242

Mainly people think that the disc has come out by getting shaken.	4.098644286569432

When because of excessive work or some other reason there is no full natural expansion , no speed or rupture happens in the disc then pressure begins to fall on the nerves.	3.0972801453230363

The capaciy of the spinal cord in the advancing age , picking up weight more than the strength or picking up in wrong way leads to slipped prolapsed disc.	2.60912977230067

If there is swelling or jerk in any part of body , which is related to the ....nerve then the pain in sciatica begins.	3.790243824285438

If the kidneys do not perform properly and there is excess formation of uric acid then also pain in Sciatica begins.	3.3798257200815107

In sciatica pain from a normal pain to unbearable pain can begin at the lower protion of the back and reach till the feet through buttocks or leg.	2.6607996999889383

This pain is generally felt in one leg and that too generally one the outer side of the leg.	3.245835338549616

It happens so because the muscles shrimp somewhat because of the cold.	4.349649980012804

Heart is the main axis of human 's life.	4.901333335151606

Those diseases which are related to the structure of the heart and its internal abnormalities they are called organic disorders.	4.558931197097445

The major diseases among the heart and blood circulation diseases are high blood pressure , low blood pressure , valvular disorders , heart ... ....disease , arterio sclirosis , hardening of blood vessles etc.	2.979004926009621

The disease of high blood pressure does not come all of a sudden.	4.8212147265068

It comes slowly after giving premonitions of several kinds.	4.082641773946482

If high blood pressure is not treated on time then heart attack , disease of kidneys , paralysis and many diseases of eyes may occur.	4.294332658180728

In low blood pressure restlessness , weakness and tiredness , headache , cold sweat etc are the symptoms.	3.6921677275412446

Angina Pectoris occurs because of high blood pressure.	6.248717966020514

When sufficient quantity of oxygen is not able to reach heart because of contraction of artries and the heart has to exert more pressure for carrying out its normal work then angina disease occurs.	2.787514250812405

Angina disease increases because of ciggarette.	7.147376995646977

Never give Reiki on the front heart chakra of heart patient.	3.5941039304469427

In case of emergency when there is a heart attack then immediately give Reiki on the back heart chakra.	4.159866009520262

Along with this make your posture on the left hand of the patient and press the front of his fingers and thumb with all your strength , heart attck will stop immediately.	3.3566232603996062

I have used this method several times in very serious circumstances and got success.	3.1275661294156185

In ... ... ....posture press the front part of both the middle and ring finger and thumb after bringing them together.	2.960263136822376

The quantiy of urine in the situation of diabetes increases from three times to twelve-thirteen times of that of normal situation.	2.9595641496463507

In diabetes the weight of many patients decrease a lot.	4.785504273120844

The skin begins to become dry and as the weight loss begins , it begins to shrivel also.	3.3170378494494486

In diabetes a painful disorder occurs in the arteries of legs because of which pain , numbness and itching etc disease occurs.	3.6974237678143376

The diabetes patients should give special attention towards their diet.	4.833202145120545

The patients should not take calories more than requirement.	5.614984959114107

The diabetes patient doing ordinary work need about 1500 to 2000 calories in a day.	2.9756213091166814

Pregnant women and young children need little more calories than this.	3.642533736801532

National Institution of Nutrition , Hyderabad has researched that the seeds of fenugreek are panacea for the diabetes patients.	2.5681655288053986

By eating 25 to 100 gm fenugreek mixed in curry or soup or else chappati diabtes can be controlled.	2.4368155967172864

From among the objects told above use only one or two objects at one time.	3.2084728131947506

It is not right to eat all the objects at once.	3.901764088555242

Besides this give Reiki to centres like pancreas , ajna chakra , solar plexus back and front , thyroid gland , live , kidneys and hara chakra etc the disease will be soon cured.	2.227335636675081

By treatment with above Reiki miraculous results have come to the fore and diabetes have been cured soon.	2.910029462428306

The most painful aspect of the joints and bones diseases is that in the condition of the increase in disease deformity appears in many body parts.	3.7423220664373655

Due to the occurrence of deformity in the joints and bones the patients are not able to walk and neither are they able to do any work with ease.	3.9403350550075023

One doctor from America had written in his book that man has reached on the moon but he does not have any cure for joint inflammation.	2.706190907321834

One should go to the nature itself for the treatment of this disease.	4.869081645670762

Reiki is the best solution for the joints and bones diseases.	5.6589113562923785

In order to give motion to the body there are several joints of bones which are called joints.	3.5997481152203736

Except skull , all other bones of the body are mobile.	6.006416536611934

Arthritis is the disease related to these very joint of bones.	4.974966970150122

Ligaments do the job of keeping these bones connected among themselves.	3.675507319331177

Besides these some fluid materials continuously keep the surface of the bones lubricated due to which the speed of the joints remain natural and easy and while moving they do not have any kind of pain.	3.5429204146296502

There are sacs of liquid material near many joints which is called bursae.	3.548644040590065

In the joint inflammation diseases in addition to the swelling of joints there is an increase in the temperature of the body.	3.5230052164519794

Muscles , tendons and nerves are also affected.	5.242956206660193

In this disease the blood vessels related to synovial membrane becomes flat from normal shape.	3.1490838917628725

These blood vessels get more supply of blood than earlier due to which protein present in the blood and some other fluid material get accumulated around the joints through the blood vessels.	3.3688336108161296

Due to this swelling occurs in the joints.	7.180894946840555

When the blood vessels collide with the joints then there is pain.	5.608777136803885

Those people who take more than 12 to 18 hours in the digestion they have a greater possibilty of contracting this disease.	3.1529394560634083

In addition to this those people in whose blood there is a large quantity of acid and calcium materials arthritis disease is seen in them also.	4.035207738805075

Those people who take excessive wine and beer and take a lot of nutritious food and do not exercise , their liver and kidneys are not able to work properly , they contract arthritis disease.	3.4144090949526267

In many people arthritis disease is paternal also.	4.7023571887427025

Rheumatoid arthritis is seen three times in women in comparison to men.	4.885254439698185

Small viruses could also become the reason behind rheumatoid arthritis.	5.325495393642908

Rheumatoid arthritis disease generally starts slowly.	5.978404317793013

In the beginning rheumatoid arthritis disease attacks the hannds and the legs.	3.3152991160002454

Sometime in rheumatoid arthritis there is pain only in the knees.	5.586077946658209

According to the symptoms while waking up in the morning there is greater stiffness in the body parts and as the afternoon comes in , pain and stiffness decreases.	3.9351898427385485

If this disease is not treated properly then heart and lungs could also be adversely affected.	4.320788786947437

Osteoarthritis generally this disease affects the people of middle age.	5.831182101687855

The symptoms of osteoarthritis is specially seen in the women.	5.144992061683428

Those women in whom this disease is seen more their menstruation ceases completely.	4.702999612261004

Osteoarthritis disease genrally affects fat people.	5.725067301334226

In osteoarthritis those joints are affected more on which the weight of the body falls i.e.spinal cord , kness and hips.	2.9642612261123924

Gout generally this disease affects men.	6.714425612828535

Gout disease genrally affects the men above the age of 40 years.	3.6562427243541995

In women this disease is very rarely seen.	6.547820559465711

Doctors are of the view that when some special protein elements purinis is not able to digest properly then this element is transformed into uric acid.	2.6791511325507025

The crystals of uric acid begin to accumulate specially in joints and kidneys and skin.	3.065268761248922

The crystals of uric acid sharp and stinging like needles.	3.451556921420067

Gout starts suddenly.	15.007356447572228

In 90 % people gout starts from the joint of the thumb of the first leg.	4.3287749853909

Along with it the patient should drink water in greater quantity and should eat fresh and green vegetables.	3.7260486919439075

Along with it the patient is benefitted moraculously by doing Reiki and with continuous treatment gout is treated completely.	2.885427584583731

While doing Reiki the patient will feel that the disease is completely cured after three-four days , but after that he will feel it again but after this the disease will be cured slowly.	3.024768876351094

In this disease Reiki is to be given at the whole body.	5.018756870916291

Reiki should be given for longer time on centres like solar plexus , liver , spleen , ajna chakra , throat chakra etc.	3.172348462865265

The importance of ajna chakra is maximum from among the different chakras situated in our body.	2.856592829826685

Ajna chakra is situated in the middle of our head i.e.in the middle of both the eyebrows.	4.089952146470894

It is also referred to as the third eye of Shiva.	3.529805811573232

This story is famous in the Puranas.	4.4834483616596685

It is by opening this third eye Lord Shankar had produced the Agni Tejas and with that the disturbing Kamdeva was burnt into ashes.	2.0081315617626925

Damyanti had protected her modesty from the tiger by producing the magnanimous fire flame from the third eye.	2.4538103567235017

From both these stories it is concluded that ajna chara is extremely important for us.	3.051860927974526

Sanjay had been able to get divine vision only by the development of the third eye.	4.416246097545174

As a result of the third eye Sanjay had begun to see all the scenes of Mahabharta war as in a television.	2.409064159714323

In the eyes of some people a special kind of attraction is found.	4.407892635107446

Special electronic waves flow through their eyes ... ... ... ....	4.739600419500276

This elctronic wave affects in both good and bad ways.	3.6552961492636165

The incident of catching bad eye is common , this idea seems like superstition but there is a scientific fact in this idea and the reason behind this is this very electronic wave.	2.762860643924164

These electronic waves have a great impact on our life.	3.8206108312534166

These electronic waves could be sharpened even more by Reiki.	3.8495909848506673

I was becoming weaker day by day.	4.410745496329643

Doctor told me that there is infection in my lungs.	5.752160731082628

I did not panic as I had already learned Reiki.	3.4747629019101236

I did not take any medicine , only did Reiki.	4.516870497155136

In about 21 days I had become completely healthy.	4.0595249230449095

Generally husband - wife consider pregnancy a chance incident while it is not completely true.	4.048437578476303

There is a necessity to spread a worldwide awareness about the safe time for pregnancy.	2.7857868714369363

In the absence of this awareness one third children and two lacs mothers become the victim of death every year.	2.8608610454254952

It could be stopped if we know the safe time for pregnancy and instead of considering it a chance incident , we know that pregnancy occurs only according to the wishes of the husband - wife.	2.4582653123244946

What is maternal death ? 	8.472925116369096

In pregnancy , if during child - birth or within six weeks of child - birth , if the woman dies , then it is called maternal death.	3.1385184890266555

Mother could also be freed of different kinds of diseases.	5.52788081420595

The meaning of lowering of mortality rate is the preservation of family , healthy nutrition and happiness in the society.	2.602090867656578

But any woman is not always suitable for procreation.	4.5138177981947605

The best period for pregnancy is from twenty to thirty years of age.	3.1745314662480593

In this scientific age the medical science has developed so much that we have begin to understand the importance of the health of the child being brought up in the womb.	3.684892695829544

The age of procreation capability of a woman is generally accepted as 15 - 45 years.	3.5335093405923117

The first five years and the last ten years of the procreation capability of women ' s life is full of risk.	3.341165865254998

If the common man could understand the terrible consequences of these 15 years of procreation then the long duration of procreation would come down to 15 years from 30 years.	2.288604624365293

That means from the age of 20 years to 35 years.	6.382414767676571

This will automatically give strength to the family planning program.	5.309780591943501

Most of the have this illusion that the sex of the child depends on the mother , which is wrong.	3.7259601150982404

The ovum of the woman has only one kind of chromosomes xx.	4.285925961041311

By the fusion of one x of woman and one x chromosome of man a daughter xx and by the fusion of one x of woman and one y of woman a son xy is born.	1.9288397524134282

Thus birth of son or daughter depends on their father and not on their mother.	2.9590944457739874

Now a days the services related to the tests during pregnancy in the antenatal of hospitals and before pregnancy and marriage-related advice in the pregnancy clinics have been started.	2.5154750582841783

The health of mother could also become suitable for the second child , not before this.	3.7343908649123336

In young age i.e.at the age of less than 18 to 20 years if there is abortion then many complexities increase.	3.7214345389455317

That is why it is said that before becoming pregnant it is necessary that a girl becomes a complete woman.	3.1729583690720067

Because of the pregnancy in young age girls become physically and mentally weak.	3.518557958456889

In young age the girls are not so mature as to handle all the responsibilities of a mother.	3.122658045137854

In them incidents of spontaneous abortion and termination of pregnancy happen more.	2.9387798035956223

Due to abortion the dangers related to it are also there , like anemia , infection , excessive blood-loss etc.	2.9490210815813738

Along with pregnancy in the young age increase in blood pressure and loss of blood from body and presence of protein in urine are also found.	3.717074365331354

Because of pregnancy in young age deficiency in blood occurs and child birth is also painful.	3.2452251009344253

During child birth the natural pain , meaning labor pain is not proper.	3.8081751061010127

Because of improper development of the hip bone and the womb there is a need for surgery.	4.376906653405387

Because of pregnancy in young age often the child is born prematurely.	4.369558035807719

The child remains ill because of incomplete development.	4.340504520412786

Sometimes because of the pregnancy in young age the child even dies.	5.682118635026267

After the pregnancy in young age often the mother becomes a victim of mental diseases.	4.0915733367453475

Sometimes the stress increases to such level that mother commits suicide.	3.1727107011623854

Bing a mother in advanced age meaning after 30-35 years of age is also extremely dangerous.	3.8083878097740143

The maximum fertility strength of a woman is in the age of 23 years which slowly decreases.	4.165675830398456

In the age of forty years there is very little pregnancy.	4.5899621485191195

In advanced age the chances of abortion also increase by pregnancy.	4.253245351205803

In advanced age blood pressure increases and the chances of heart disease increases with pregnancy.	4.69136473150549

In advanced age the effect of blood impurity increases during conception to pregnancy.	3.820476668063223

In advanced age there is a greater chance of vomiting because of pregnancy or blood loss during pregnancy.	3.659643776598944

In advancing age often excrescence forms in the womb.	4.816169186800908

This excrescence produces pain during pregnancy and causes obstacles during child birth.	3.7108896628605654

Due to which child birth is done through surgery and not naturally.	4.208850188072503

The labor pain starts before the scheduled time and the birth of child also takes place before scheduled time.	3.3958972494506527

With the advancing age there is an effect on the elasticity of the joints also and many time times placenta is also retained.	3.3324188414510476

With the increase in the need for more surgery the danger for surgeons could also increase.	3.9788590293037793

In the children born in advanced age there is an expansion of the innate defects.	3.5429471555543124

Most of the children are born with innate physical defects like organ-fractures or limb disorder.	3.224863018829561

The innate physical defects of the children are also called ' Mangol Triguna Sutrata '.	4.3726435074453445

With advancing age sometimes the child dies in the womb itself.	4.158066830176709

Dangers are not only in the pregnancy during young age or advanced age rather excessive pregnancy meaning if there are four or more children then there is a great increase in the mortality rate.	3.6167872774411642

Many types of danger also arise because of excessive pregnancy.	5.00298791546585

During pregnancy development of the child takes place in the womb of the mother itself.	6.335508951648912

The elements which are required for the formation of human body , the child is dependent on the body of the mother for all that.	4.995518287356194

It could be easily understood that during pregnancy there is a deficiency of many important elements in the mother 's body.	4.1357586763688445

Among these the main elements are iron , calcium and protein.	4.226709090555336

During the period of breast feeding the child also the mother 's need of calcium and protein is almost double of the normal.	3.6794784978382356

Deficiency of blood could also be lethal.	8.344359554900826

The woman does not get opportunity to give complete meal to her body and make it healthy.	4.127165313668989

Because of deficiency in hemoglobin percentage deficiency of calcium occurs in the body.	4.052641899897928

As a consequence of the deficiency of calcium occurrence of ostomellisia is possible.	3.87674022864611

There are many similarities in the eco system of the Earth and our body.	3.091735160714596

The way the development of human civilisation has taken place along with the presence of water , similarly the physiology of our body is completely dependant on water.	3.483539165602397

Actually , the human body is made up of 70 % water as per nature.	5.243629771958526

Water is found from human cells to bones , muscles and blood.	3.9456536766054104

How much water is necessary for which part of the body , this is controlled by the endocrine system present in the body.	3.8441385245599764

The responsibility of taking the nutrients and the waste products of the body from one place to the other in a systematic manner is only of the water.	3.3667337100697328

On not paying attention to the dry skin on the upper surface the dryness of the skin does the work of harming the natural beauty by reaching deep inside layer by layer.	2.998803295542907

On reaching this point the cells of the skin begins to hang in the form of wrinkles by leaving its naturalness.	3.7489476151627574

In order to give a healthy form to the skin it is necessary that it is nourished by those products , which nourishes the skin by making a proper balance of the water.	3.320419369309295

In this case the court had asked if a 20 kg overweight pilot can get on the aeroplane , then how can a 500 gram overweight air hostess can be landed from the plane ?.	1.9680787590627156

Delhi High Court had pronounced this judgement on 4 May , 2006.	3.5968770355493676

Now a multi-member bench of Delhi High Court is rethinking on this.	2.7277253640982564

Which size is proper for the airhostess , this will be deliberated upon , but the effect of the ruling will also fall on the society along with the fashion world , the medical word.	2.724308126153848

In this diet carbohydrate is not included and its deficiency is accounted for by fat and protein intake.	2.5195958000766763

The reason behind this is that if the amount of carbohydrate in our body becomes excess then that excess carbo will be accumulated as fat in our body which should not happen at all.	3.3737943553718175

Exercising everyday is very necessary.	8.636262096401296

Both the body and the mind remains healthy by exercise.	5.443175758218609

Very often the doctor gives similar advice to the patients but the patients do not take it seriously.	3.643004229338578

They make themselves so busy in the daily life that even if they want they are not able to spare time for the exercise.	3.5367591218033128

Several people defer it by saying that we walk everyday the exercise takes place by that only.	2.847511296042486

But doctors keep a different view regarding this.	4.265597933802355

Physiotherapy is related to the exercise.	10.575564001921931

According to Dr.Kanchan , physiotherapy is a kind of tretment , in which the patient is treated with different kinds of compress and exercises.	3.714065027312959

Generally people believe that physiotherapy is used for the treatment of only a few diseases but physiotherapy is beneficial in all diseases.	4.1467120529531725

For example one breast of the women is removed because of the breast cancer.	5.661892561721676

They sit by keeping the hand towards the removed breast and when they have to remove the hand then the women face a lot of problem.	3.8292375044736024

Physiotherapy is done in 3 ways.	11.476635734812888

Active movement , passive movement and continuous passive movement.	4.292470442558486

Several times the patient is not even able to get up from the bed in the beginning after the operation or because of the pain on some part of the body.	4.558098936425232

Through passive movement the patient is made to do exercise by giving some hit at that time.	3.742397251322193

In continuous passive treatment the patient is continuously given several types of treatments.	4.51605407907074

Active movement is given to those patients , who can do the exercise by themselves i.e.they can move.	3.7792922241665505

What is the difference between physiotherapy and yoga ?.	4.692784211938458

Answering this question Dr.Kanchan teels , the main purpose of physiotherapy is to give support to the bones by increasing the strength of the muscles.	3.0088929311606387

The people who do yoga stress on only one thing that people of every age could do this but there is nothing like this in physiotherapy.	3.1264162986790223

We think that every body has their own physique therefore we first examine the patient physically then exercise and treatment is given accordingly.	2.5605777582889053

You get strength through physiotherapy but in order to maintain that there is great need of physiotherapy.	4.074883442145631

Now a days children keep on sitting in front of TV all twenty four hours , which causes many problems in them.	2.799899071348356

Sometimes one gets pain the back by sitting in the wrong posture or its bone is slipped by working continuously with the same part of the body.	2.9606230062718777

In such a situation one could also reduce weight by physiotherapy.	3.678842096035503

By this there is a development of the muscles of the body.	6.475005055604067

They begin to do work with a new method.	5.771929410290707

For dry hair you massage the hair with oil with light hands 2-3 hours before washing them.	3.456404732645181

Buy such an oil for massage in which the ayurvedic Brahmi herb and myrobalan is present.	3.796772387735532

Brahmi has been used for a long time as the main revitalising herb for brain cells and nerves in the Ayurveda.	3.3278028960804233

n order to keep the memory sharp and massage the hair properly massage the hair regularly with the oil having Ayurvedic Brahmi and myrobalan.	2.9731684244644536

Brahmi is not only helpful in giving relaxation to the mind and keeping it stress free , but also it works as hair conditioner in making the hair soft and silky.	2.8357475389391507

Myrobalan makes the hair shining and healthy.	5.045767139210772

Shampoo a little while after the massage.	7.18929520962579

Conditioner has necessary elements , which give nutrition to the hair.	4.6552265052793675

Apply 5-7 drops of serum in mildly wet hair and then comb it so that the hair do not fall much.	3.278796030645626

Serum will work as the protective shield for your hair and it will save your hair from more frizzy look.	2.9744417619001378

Abdomen is made up of five layers.	6.566315558737925

If we look towards outside from the internal part then the most internal first layer is called ` mucosa '.	2.8361821978310937

The formation of acidic and digestion juice takes place in the mucosa.	3.9656723156200804

The layer after this is called ` submucosa '.	7.342448812617454

In the emty condition the abdomen shrinks and mucosa and submucosa fold , which is called ` ruge '.	2.984302264817451

Mainly four kinds of secreting ` epihelium cells ' cover the abdominal surface and elaborated or spread till gastric pits and glands.	2.281496739143432

Mucous cells secrete basic mucous which saves the epithelium with excessive stress and acid.	2.8836371732632347

Parietal cells ' secrete hydrochloric acid or if said in simple terms then acid.	3.0361608763601375

Main cells secrete pepsin which is protiolytic enzyme for the fragmentation of protein.	2.9357509809567692

G cells ' secrete the gastrine hormone.	5.454164791772778

Because of the basic mucous layer internal layer of the abdomen the abdominal walls are saved from burning by the acid secreted by ` parietal cells '.	2.9457331387750827

Abdomen carries out the four basic works , which helps in the primary stages of the diestion.	3.3717832257575866

It was believed in the earlier times that the lifestyle-related reasons like stress and diet become the reason behind ulcer.	2.8855314381101604

After this the researchers have established that hydrochloric acid and pepsin are also responsible for the formation of ulcer.	3.5380978250858086

Peptic ulcer develops because of helicobacter pailori bacterium.	4.139568539047209

The research has made it clear that most of the ulcers occur because of infection with a bacteris helicobacter pailori.	3.325277376403318

Helicobacter pailori bacteria produces such mateials which weakens the mucous giving protection to the abdomen.	3.0994570016663627

Because of the weakening of mucous acid and pepsin there is fatal effect on the abdomen and the formation of acid and pepsin begins even more quickly.	3.193289079449987

The studies have told that the possibility of ulcer increases by smoking.	4.849347896007436

There is also a negative impact on the treatment of ulcer by smoking and the possibility of increase in ulcer increases.	4.608579696731817

However the increase in the secretion of acid in the abdomen is not just because of the caffeine.	6.397399453847259

Till now no direct relationship between peptic ulcer and the consumption of wine has become present.	3.283912664142589

But the established ulcer is found in large quantity in those persons , who have sirosis of liver and which is related to greater consumption of wine.	3.2821371924893867

Although emotional stress is now not considered the main reason behind ulcer , yet the people suffering from ulcer complains that the pain of ulcer increases by emotional stress.	3.2986253951734033

Physical stress could increase the danger of development of ulcer , especially in the abdomen.	4.513634867175048

In order to stop the ulcer from developing and stopping its complications there is a need for extensive treatment.	2.9820823499947418

It is believed that the deficiency in the capacity to protect oneself from strong digestive materials of the abdomen like hydrochloric aci and pepsin is a big reason of the formation of ulcer.	3.265038560961192

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory NSAIDs drugs like aspirin , ibruffen and naeproksen increases the dangerous effeect of acid and pepsin in the abdomen.	2.402586740871778

These medicines are commonly present in the headache , small pain killers.	4.508206616737173

Ulcer does not always manifest some symptoms , but the common symptom of ulcer is the burning pain or glowing in between the chest bone and the naval.	2.8182844731446646

This pain of ulcer is generally felt in between the two meals and in the morning time.	5.260976048418736

The duration of this pain of ulcer could be from few minutes to few hours.	3.3699142435422953

The symptoms of abdominal and dudenal ulcer could be similar to other digestive conditions or general medical problems.	2.629522835602722

Please consult your doctor for the proper treatment of ulcer.	5.734167587792378

Serious complications could arise because of not taking proper treatment at proper time by the people suffering from ulcer.	4.022952659346244

Since ulcer erodes the muscles of abdominal and dudenum walls , which could lead to damage in the blood capillaries.	3.577776695734737

The reason behind damage to the blood capillaries could be blood secretion.	3.903162905138399

Sometimes ulcer creates a hole by eating up the abdominal or dudenal wall , due to which bacteria and half-digested food jumps to the abdominal cavity paritonium which increases the infection in abdominal cavity and the wall.	2.3664372286194566

The ulcer situated at the other end of the abdomen where dudenum is attached causes swelling and wound , due to which the entrance of the intestine is closed.	3.177090248381968

Because of this reason by blockage the food could not come out of the abdomen and could not enter into the small intestine , due to which there is vomiting of materials present in the abdomen.	3.948633309603921

How can one detect the ulcer ?.	5.700630009019166

Since different kinds of methods are used for the treatment of different kinds of ulcers , therefore the correct treatment of ulcer or H Pylori is necessary before the treatment.	3.8385784298399526

For example the treatment of ulcer produced by NSAID is very different from the ulcer produced by H Pylori.	3.642097306347851

There are many options for the correct treatment of the ulcer.	4.948056256797594

Similarly necessary options are available for the treatment of H.Pylori.	4.943266201859719

Included among these processes of treatment is upper GI Gastrointestinal Series.	3.404856467940276

In gastrointestinal series a liquid material like chalk which is borium is given to the patient.	2.9883860941469647

After this with the help of the x-ray of oesophaus , abdomen and dudenum the correct situation of the ulcer is examined.	3.261823759534006

In endoscopy a flexible instrument at the other end of which a camera is fixed is inserted into the oesophagus , abdomen and udenum through the mouth , so that the upper pipe could be seen completely.	2.664187440446248

The testing of blood , respiration and abdominal tissues is carried out to find out the presence of H.Pylori.	3.1771222513753785

In earlier times doctors used to give the patients the suggestion to keep away from fried , acidic , spiy and food having fat.	2.8409896350871624

However for the right treatment of ulcer bland food has no longer remained effective.	3.4944083629425546

Those people who find it that some foods create restlessness in them they should consult their doctor.	2.607416286289572

Smoking is related to ulcer not being cured and its being born again , therefore ulcer infected people should not smoke.	2.9700815549046506

Doctors treat the ulcer of abdomen and dudenum with the following medicines.	3.9238166522271243

H2 blocker reduces the quantity of acid in the abdomen by stopping the repoduction of histamin which is responsible for secreting acid in the abdomen.	3.42695181379219

There is a complete seizure of production of acid in the abdomen by the medicines for stopping the pump of acid.	3.8675928710405567

By this acid pump the main place of acid secretion is stoped.	3.2621043659481637

Antacid  ` mucozal protective agent ' is used to protect the mucous lining of the abdomen from the harm caused by the acid.	3.3303318715792356

Antacid.Mucozal protective agent does not reduce the secretion of acid.	4.31536175521756

During the treatment of H.Pylori these medicines are used with other antibiotics.	5.336339031875796

The discovery of relation between ulcer and H.Pylori has given birth to a new alternative antibiotics treatment.	2.9411372298562997

In most of the cases the anti ulcer-medicines cures the ulcer quickly and effectively.	2.904302048992518

By these medicines with the end of H.Pylori the possibility of ulcer coming up again reduces.	4.009420809284771

However those patients on whom the medicines are not effective or who slowly develop complexities , they may need operation.	2.639613140711594

In today 's times laproscopic surgery is being brought into use for the treatment of ulcer.	3.690262338379884

In ` vagotiomy ' process vagus a nerve which functions to send the message from the mind to the abdominal nerve is being cut so that the signal could be stopped and the secretion of acid could not take place in the abdomen.	2.807274220399388

In ` entrectomy ' the lower portion of the stomach is removed because it produces a hormone which is responsible for the secretion of digestive juice in the stomach.	3.702085145435484

Pyloriplasty ' is that operation which could also be done with vagotomy.	5.082134095712215

In the pyloriplasty operation dudenum and small intestine pylorus are made bigger such that the activity of the edible materials could increase from the abdomen.	2.62621667801429

In the future the standard methods of laproscopic operation may become prevalent.	2.945754186053362

Laproscope is an instrument of a long tube with camera which the surgeopn enters into the skin after putting small cuts and looks at the internal activity on a video monitor.	2.1997062585522658

Gastro oesophygal reflux disease GERD or reflux oesophegaitis is such a disease , in which the lower portion of the abdomen 's structure enters into the oesophagus due to which the lining of its soft part is destroyed by the acid.	3.1105681762120927

As a result of this there is burning sensation in the upper portion of the abdomen which is called epigastric and lower middle chest.	4.185279714380556

Heart burn , burning sensation or restlessness in the chest bone or behind the sterman are the most common symptoms of acidity.	3.7678839103632584

Along with this return of gastric material in the mouth or chest regurgitation may happen.	3.420474246346015

Oesophagus is a big pipe which takes the food from the empty place in the mouth to the stomach in the abdomen.	4.273031174481577

Oesophagus crosses the chest and passes through diaphragm.	5.171046961877642

Whenever the food comes in the upper protion of the oesophagus , this pipe starts a kind of activity , which is called ` peristalsis ' in which the food is brought from oesophagus to the abdomen below.	3.61078579221716

It takes less than one minute to bring the food or liquid material into the door of the mouth.	3.1894999311043417

Here the acid secreted from the abdomen begins the digestive work on this food.	3.780650297817318

At the lower end of this pipe there is a gate protected by a thumb like muscles which keeps the lower part sealed so that the food material does not come back to oesophagus after reaching in the abdomen.	3.23653515742508

Among the main reasons of GERD unstable lower oesophigial sphincter relaxation , reduced LED resting tone , ineffective oesophigial clearance in the emptying of abdomen and deficiency in the production saliva are included.	2.206332476486265

The most common symptom of GERD is heart burn.	4.473110879049268

The most posibility of occurrence of GERD is after the lunch in the day.	4.24191911621751

Some people feel the reflux during the sleep also.	3.9379318394818417

The relation of nocturnal reflux while sleeping at the night is generally with more dangerous and excessive oesophigitis.	3.1189862570276934

In this the acid remains in the oesophagus for longer time.	3.9734273862725935

Because there is deficiency in the quantity of production and swallowing of saliva for deactivating the acid.	3.697471026760423

The determination of the symptoms of the loss of oesophigial mucozal and its quantity mainly depends on the quantity of refluxed material and time of the contact of acid in the oesophigial.	3.478200680667509

In the patients suffering from the acidity their internal mucozal resistance system is affected by the excessive reflux , which produces many other symptoms also.	3.0444321556768985

There are many options for the treatment of the GERD , in which change in normal lifestyle to treatment are included.	2.802084773401284

The motive of the treatment of the GERD is to reduce or end its symptoms.	3.9745148422158696

To fill up the damage of the damaged cells of the oesophagus.	4.712002318703037

The motives of the treatment of GERD are to avoid the spicy , fatty and fried food.	4.031220462449956

Exercising regularly and reducing the excessive weight of the body could be a good beginning towards the prevention of GERD disease.	3.9076093554529825

Try to take the meal two hours before sleeping.	5.182720999000793

Keeping the head of one 's bed slightly high could also be beneficial in the GERD disease.	4.502677899530079

Most of the food materials which have carbohydrate could be the reason for gas.	5.364944891191009

The food materials opposite to this which have fat or protein , produces less fat.	3.0459134366871945

Raphinage , lacose , fructos and sarbitol are small carbohydrate.	3.801999943661089

However comparatively it is in less quantity in cauliflower , sprouts , broccolli , other vegetables and whole cereals.	3.244222941610011

The natural sharcara present in the milk is called lactose.	5.4342722180634055

Lactose is also found in sufficient quantity in milk products like cheese , ice cream , processed food like bread , cereals and salad dressing.	2.924789518307855

Fructose is naturally found in onion , pineapple and wheat etc.	4.127914715078867

Fructose is used to produce sweetness in drinks and fruit juice.	4.211204204710633

Sorbitol is that sarcara which is naturally found in the fruits in which apple , pineapple , peach and prune are included.	2.8283643763364625

It is used to bring artificial sweetness in dietic food materials and sarcara-less toffees and chewing gums.	2.584151198593766

Most of the starch , in which potato , cereal , noodles and wheat etc are included , they produce gas because their disintegration and digestion takes place in the large intestine.	2.66570269890201

Rice is the only starch which is not responsible for producing gas.	4.858571765858131

Generally all vegetables and fruits are considered good source of fiber.	5.050329765441989

Any food material which is with peel has fibers.	3.933416189598052

Whole cereals , pulses with covering also have fibers.	4.256179649452831

In many food materials there are soluble and insoluble fiber.	3.6361789305709604

Soluble fiber dissolves in the water easily and forms a soft jail like shape in the intestines.	3.252993337310326

The disintegration and digestion of soluble fiber does not take place until it does not reach large intestine , where the digestion leads to the production of gas.	3.4856885446821817

On the other hand insoluble fiber passes through the intestines without any change and produces less gas.	2.731065733802341

Insoluble fiber produces less gas.	6.512051193179016

Those food mateials which could produce gas in some people , they may not have any effect on the others.	3.838757340480111

Some common bacteria present in the large intestine may destroy the hydrogen produced by the other bacteria.	3.701984327689821

The balance of these two bacteria explains the fact that why gas is formed in some people in larger quantity than in the others.	3.064359970245081

Gas is produced in almost every person , which is issued out either by belching or through stool.	2.8354847396259575

Although many people think that they have a greater gas problem while in reality its quantity is normal.	3.4724979797574034

Most of the people produce 1 to 3 pint gas everyday and pass the gas around 14 times everyday.	2.5479200370438924

Gas is primarily formed by the mixture of odourised vapor carbon dioxide , oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen and sometimes methane.	2.6038681930030925

The unpleasant odourof flatulence comes by that bacteria which is situated in the large intestine and which produces such gas , which has sulphur.	2.8758933270436926

Understanding the reasons behind gas , paying attention to the methods of its reduction and treatment at the right time could only give riddance from this problem.	3.115825391351286

Swallowing the air is a common reason behind gas in the abdomen.	5.945852589394357

Every person swallows the air in some quantity while eating or drinking.	3.6123377215876444

However eating or drinking quickly , smoking or wearing the loose artificial teeth etc also become the reason behind ` aerophisia ' in some people.	2.887360134082801

Burping or hiccup is that process in which nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide which is swallowed along with the air etc exit from the abdomen.	2.64593466130517

Its small quantity also goes into the large intestine where it exits through the way of rectum.	3.4514164893323263

When the acid and bicarbonate are mixed in the abdomen , then carbon dioxide is also produced from the abdomen , but a large part of this gas is absorbed in the blood flow and does not enter into the large intestine.	3.32453748373699

Those people in whom there is production of methane gas in larger quantity , it is not necessary that some special indication be present in them.	3.509216467396557

The stool of that person , in whom there is greater production of methane , continues to flow in the water.	3.2306548620199482

The research has not been able to find why there is greater production of methane in some people when compared to the other people.	3.4237198162687634

Otis flow ' disease generally takes place in the children.	5.690131421513412

Otis flow disease occurs in the middle of the ear because of the germs.	6.971259702512715

This disease of otis flow could also occur because of syphilis , tonsilitis and old cough.	3.4240065685037275

The children begin to suffer from the fits of ear pain.	4.199265705316876

When the pus begins to flow out then the pain reduces a litle.	3.9011870390810595

After cleaning the ear properly with cotton after applying the spray of boric acid , blow in the boric iodine and apply the cotton afterwards.	2.385017934230876

Clean the ear by putting hydrogen peroxide in the ear.	4.55292118817082

Later on put in the cotton after pouring mercurochrome glycerin or aecriolect.	3.367688920649863

After dropping few drops of boric spirit in the ears and cleaning the ears in some time close it with the cotton.	3.994922187331911

In this disease injections of penicillin , strepo-penicillin , comaisin etc are beneficial.	2.9129639824171867

Sometimes the pieces of gram , pea or cotton etc enter into the ear of children or adults , which are not able to come out and the patient feels very uncomfortable and laziness.	3.443284727240468

If it is not possible to remove the object in the ear for some time because of swelling etc then warm it by mixing boric acid in the hot water and spray the boric lotion in the ear after the swelling subsides.	3.3440793804911606

By this the object fallen in the ear will be removed from its place and could be easily removed with the help of tweezers or matchstick.	3.187428558329819

It should be kept in mind that if insects enter into the ear then for removing that instead of using tweezers or matchstick one should fill it with the hot mustard oil so that the insect or any other thing gets drowned.	2.967288371576914

This way the object fallen in the ear could be easily removed.	4.194395071380926

Those people who do not clean their teeth , the disease of germs in their teeth is more widespread.	4.463502335535516

Holes appear in their teeth or molars.	5.70638255403704

Teeth and molars decay and comes out in pieces.	5.388251416642914

The patient suffers extreme pain in the diseases of teeth.	7.055093430622245

In the teeth diseases the pain increases even more by eating sweets.	4.207085857808075

If the tooth or the molar does not move then it is good to fill up silver in them.	3.287258325566626

If the tooth moves then it is better to bring it out.	4.867263987466863

One gets relief by applying carbolic acid or cotton buds with clove oil in the molar hole.	3.0372137061654234

Teeth are benfitted by taking ostocalcium or a similar medicine , in which the quantity of calcium is more.	3.686514309018054

In order to protect oneself against the teeth diseases it is beneficial to cleanse the teeth eveyday and use vitamin ` c '.	2.964824220464432

There are two kinds of gynaecology leucorrhoea.	5.460287377076331

First leucorrhoea which comes out of the vagina.	7.150104040820734

Second leucorrhoea which comes out of cervix.	6.653758142711014

The secretion coming out of the vagina is milky white or yellow and like thin curd during pregnancy.	3.1276009649106427

The secretion coming out of the cervix is sticky or with pus.	3.919906131506179

Mostly the young girls living in the dirty localities or dense population suffer from leucorrhoea.	2.9561456172062877

The inflammation of pregnancy , syphillis , uterus cancer or tumor on the cervix , weakness etc are the main reasons of leucorrhoea.	3.0568805742262026

Besides this there should be the treatment of other parts of the body which encourages the leucorrhoea disease.	5.230127964841592

1.Common salt 1 dram in 20 ounce.	5.2617390209476005

2.Zinc Sulpahte 1 dram in 2 ounce , tincture iodine 30 m.in 20 ounce or copper sulphate 10 grains in 20 ounce.	2.4766749785399376

Egg-white like secretion begins to come out because of the formation of wound in the cervix of the uterus.	4.525891477397589

In this the wound should be treated.	5.282731114566442

Give one tablet of the special medicines lakorina thrice in a day and two tablets of leukol thrice in a day.	2.95225828524822

Use the tablets of micostatin benzene , S.B.C.or deluson for ten to fourteen days for keeping inside the vagina.	2.4788324291276047

Fruit juice is beneficial for the health.	8.053445327185509

Fruits are the invaluable gift of the nature for our health.	4.039946042439655

In order to remain healthy drinking the fruit juice has remained our tradition for centuries.	2.9685465320215747

A recent study has also proved it that by drinking fruit juice not only the day begins well but it also removes the deficiency of the nutritious food.	3.210947342892496

In the reoprt of this research published in a medicine journal by the name of Archives of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine it has been told that those children between 2 to 11 years who take hundred percent fruit juice get more nutritious food than those childen who do not take it.	2.764973158736481

Also there is less problems of obesity , saturated fat , sodium , extra sugar and extra fat in the children who drink juice in comparison to those who do not drink juice.	3.596376904478127

A society by the name of Advisory Committee of Dietary Guidelines for Americans have also reached at the same conclusion in its report filed in 2005.	2.4900499829493503

The child nutrition researcher Dr.Theresa Nicholas in a study conducted with her colleagues has considered the above findings to be correct that juice consumers get many main nutrional elements in more quantity.	2.1895924384151635

The nutritionist of Sita Ram Bhartiya Hospital r.Kajal states that there are many main nutrional elements in the 100 percent fruit juice , like vitamin-c , potassium , magnesium , follett , B-6 and iron.	2.364885371051403

Because of the presence of lot of taste and nutrition the fruit juice could be called the tasty health drink.	2.91819963024957

The above study also gives reply to the concerns expressed towards the consumption of the fruit juice in the past.	3.577609062518931

In the study this fear is said to be baseless that there is negative impact on the consumption of milk by the consumption of fruit juice.	3.7481627528559778

This study has also found the argument of arrival of obesity in children because of 100 percent consumption of fruit juice to be wrong.	2.7810337718450193

According to Dr.Nicholas The condition of obesity in children has nothing to do with the hundred percent consumption of fruit juice.	2.7358934421637926

This kind of research has proved that there is no danger of obesity in children because of hundred percent consumption of fruits.	3.541190776508546

Dr.Nicholas says , We have found that those children who do not take fruit juice , they have a grater danger of becoming obese.	3.5582507998762622

Not only this , this fact has also come to the light by this research that juice consumers eat more fuit than non-juice consumers.	2.6840931353159942

The interesting thing is that hundred percent fruit juice is in itself considered the image of fruit.	3.649154011458083

Therefore it is a wise thing to start your day with the Tropicana 100 percent fruit juice.	3.2301473000058976

In the case of completely using the blessings of the nature and making our future healthy and with complete nutrition the important role of the fruit juice could not be negated.	2.69227109603558

Coconut oil is a natural skin conditioner.	7.726677661925872

Loric , capric and capralic acid inherent in the coconut oil keeps your skin beautiful.	3.063935442109031

Besides this these acids of coconut oil become the substitute for the lipids destroyed from the surface of the skin.	3.147822720268639

They enhance the glow of the skin , protect from the harmful rays of the sun and prevent wrinkles and spots.	3.8025652248151376

it is really easy to get immaculate , soft and spotless skin.	3.3689052931938184

When the coconut oil is applied on the skin , it is probably the best medication in the world for skin protection.	4.175600445681762

Coconut oil is safer and healthier than even the lotions and the creams.	3.2328570109883725

It has been seen that individuals hurt in big road accidents die even before reaching the hospital.	2.785704703537443

In deaths occurring in road accidents 75 % direct - indirect role is of chest wound.	3.157111755245017

Hence do not ignore chest wound and treat immediately.	4.395097515665803

The level of emergency health centres is very low in our country.	3.73939237296121

In about 80 percent people lungs get seriously damaged along with occurrence of rib fracture.	2.8165881974170133

As a result of this blood and air fill up inside the chest.	3.0867543354506726

Filling up of air inside chest is called pneumothorax while filling up of blood is called hemothorax.	3.1995366433378356

If both these conditions are not treated immediately then in 80 percent cases there is a chance of death of a patient.	3.9924885381284914

People do not understand this that the person whose rib has fractured his lung must be definitely injured slightly or in more amount.	2.5635281349542565

Consequently we pay more attention to rib injury rather than lung injury and overlook lung injury.	2.6514571952396557

In A.R.D.S.process of oxygen fails along with respiration.	3.119249457926872

As a result of this amount of oxygen in blood reduces horribly.	4.030141233178234

By this amount of carbon dioxide increases.	5.7807717905692035

Other parts of body like kidney , mind and heart stop working by this.	3.855944521345573

X - ray of chest starts looking white instead of black.	3.6976532987070283

Patient reach orthopaedicians.	13.812539763545102

It has two disadvantages.	8.695150766696056

One that they waste the precious time received for treatment , second right assessment of injured lung does not happen and third , to escape from pain occurring in rib injury tight cloth is tied across the chest.	2.2189054857031816

Sometimes chest is even plastered.	7.176161956223214

By it harm is caused to the patient instead of benefit.	4.604208389407105

Because of external pressure that is exerted on chest lung that is already injured is unable to inflate properly and it either shrinks or the possibility of pneumonia increases.	2.7228601854283405

As a result of this breathing process of patient gets constrained.	3.701117718817379

Hence there is more possibilty of occurrence of deficiency of iron in vegetarians.	6.55846111080674

The absorption of iron from intestines depends on the iron accumulated in body.	4.299384966336586

From reduction of amount of iron in body its absorption from intestines increases whereas reduces from increased amount.	3.288359888815854

If absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful , it is insoluble and its use is unable to take place in body.	2.527094540481832

In blood iron stays joined with transferrin protein.	3.8941141063428475

98 % iron is utilised in red blood cells in bone marrow for the production of hemoglobin.	3.683123269314437

It reaches the cells through blood and remain joined with ferritin protein in blood , this way iron is soluble and less harmful.	2.3566116273637316

When required body can use it.	6.403296219803789

If amount of ferritin increases in cells then it turns into insoluble hemosiderin which can be harmful for body.	3.0423531269930026

About one gram iron is accumulated mainly in liver cells and macrophage.	2.8877575683115246

On the occurrence of requirement of iron accumulated in body body uses it.	3.544226550216895

The deficiency or excess of iron in body can be detected from blood iron level , transferrin and ferritin.	3.2259390639062056

Deficiency of iron is present in half the population in the world.	5.217442835937864

The deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in adequate amount in food.	3.9527346757366977

If capsules  tablets with more iron or food substances containing iron are consumed for a long time or more iron reaches inside body through other causes.	2.5287314055776045

Tissues become damaged from the effect of the active free radicals being produced from excess of iron.	3.453496543548655

If because of thalassemia , sickle cell anemia , etc blood needs to be given at regular intervals then iron starts accummulating in body in more amount.	2.832625520005011

In some people absorption of iron from intestines takes place in large amount because of which also there can be excess of iron in body.	3.823559463374934

This disease is usually hereditary because of irregularity in genes.	3.711591895148861

This disease of excess of iron is called ' hemosiderosis '.	5.784060113056301

Spots appear on skin on iron reaching body in much amount.	3.6715557304411663

Diabetes can occur from urinary bladder getting damaged.	5.6649103220287556

In walnut omega - 3 fatty acid is present in the largest amount than other kinds of kernels.	3.78760889538021

It has been found from researches going on for more than a decade that on including walnut in regular diet flexibility in blood vessels increases and chance of formation of clot becomes weak.	2.5002060047045767

The quality most important than all of these in walnut is that ldl cholesterol responsible for heart disease and C - reactive protein reduces by it.	2.6318710060262216

Tuberculosis : This disease happens from mycobacteria.	7.033220748720512

Every year about 30 lakh people die of this disease.	4.178877261235995

In this most deaths occur in developing countries.	3.9749032269663958

In the world about 80 lakhs new tuberculosis patients are increasing , in which 95 % are in developing countries.	3.1361734642313053

At any time there remain about one and a half to two crores of tuberculosis patients in the world in which tuberculosis bacteria remain present in the expectoration of half the patients.	2.776623920802604

In India tuberculosis bacteria are present in about 40 % of the population and every year 5 lakh deaths occur from tuberculosis.	3.202761202842967

One patient of tuberculosis in whose expectoration tuberculosis bacteria are present is spreading the disease every year in 10 to 15 new people.	2.911188715172743

When tuberculosis disease is present in the country with such horridness then even children can not escape it.	3.7024511869034726

When a tuberculosis patient coughs or sneezes then tuberculosis bacteria come out in thousands.	3.322297775545

Their large drops do drop on the ground but minute drops keep floating in the air.	3.1778385949154906

Tuberculosis patients are mostly poor , uneducated , where the whole family lives in a small closed room.	2.91414786545589

The number of bacteria in the room increases from coughing continuously which reach the bodies , lungs and other body parts of other family members through breath.	2.666721110407583

Children who stay weak immediately come in their grip.	4.181912931159171

It produces a reaction on reaching the lungs of children.	5.0064975990467575

Finishing one cycle in 8 - 10 weeks bacteria reaches the stage of dormant.	3.6909084342771674

During this children may have common fever , cough , cold , coryza , etc which heals even without treatment but some children who are malnourished , are afflicted with some other serious disease or whose disease resistance capacity is weak , such a child needs treatment urgently.	2.2700796768921068

Other than lungs tuberculosis can influence any part of body.	3.595779641352622

Its diagnosis in children is very difficult.	7.21160229990574

Only clever specialist therapists can diagnose it on time.	3.6110291438755993

On getting health test of child you can get a diagnosis from conducting some blood tests and x - ray , sonography.	2.715567993604743

One another tuberculin test is also conducted whose report is received after 48 to 72 hours.	2.8421002994173628

Tuberculin test being positive shows that bacteria of tuberculosis have entered the child.	3.0978007639868674

In emaciated and sick , weak children this test may be negative even in presence of tuberculosis.	2.9405176990980237

This test may be negative in those children also whose disease resistance capacity is weak.	3.143061453154774

Once diagnosis has been done one can get free of this disease on taking medicine regularly for six months under the care of a therapist.	3.9038094539483983

Child can get seriously ill on not getting diagnosis or treatment on time or child can lose life.	2.8131405819872395

If these symptoms exist in children then there may be tuberculosis.	4.580084941134361

Weight of child not increasing or remaining stable or reducing a little.	3.134216346023472

Feeling weak.	32.22454712502965

Child has no problem in urination even then coming of pus or blood in urine.	3.3036243210457035

On occurrence of any of the above symptoms consult with a specialist doctor.	4.4605470991664555

Bad breath because of diabetes , shaking of molars or teeth , growth of gaps between the teeth , etc kind of disorders occur.	2.5925150518793556

In the above situation one should increase the dose of medicines and get tested from a good doctor.	3.2112682769891783

During treatment we met many such patients who had no knowledge of diabetes.	3.441351854125864

On seeing condition of gums and from other symptoms one detects the possibility of disease of diabetes which can be determined in pathology from testing the blood.	3.249703312846276

Dentists talk about extracting teeth merely on occurrence of a decrease in sugar amount in patient.	3.4963786701387836

There is a wrong conception in some dentists that until blood sugar reduces wound will not heal from extraction of tooth.	2.457972698338096

Since this conception is produced because of misunderstandings hence from the point of view of the masses it is not an easy task to extract it.	2.96253932597082

Believe that as and when you shaking or decaying tooth keep coming out your graph of blood sugar will slowly start coming down.	2.51128579308513

Keep in mind that blood flow in body is maximum in the upper part of body meaning in head and mouth.	4.188839812158929

When there would be more blood flow there would also heal soon.	4.134239802389763

From too much flow of blood in the mouth wound of diabetes patients with more blood heals like that of a normal person and sugar also reduces from extracting all shaking teeth.	3.212428199099931

Keep in mind that blood sugar increases in a situation of pus anywhere in body.	3.4050103578477806

Pus situated in gums reduces along with extraction of teeth , accordingly blood sugar also reduces.	2.7345786400955947

Test teeth of children every 3 - 4 months and make child brush from the age of one year.	3.604769883262342

Teeth of children will go bad soon from giving child too much chocolate , biscuit.	2.879023306062593

After a meal brush your teeth on gargling and after brushing at night surely floss.	2.8570658521355554

Get your teeth cleaned by a dentist every year.	3.9964510690315898

There is good and cheap treatment of decayed teeth in the initial stage.	3.6414584671258887

Eating carrot , radish , apple , fruit , etc remains beneficial for gums.	3.7610099691695704

Use extremely soft brush like super soft toothbrush and massaging gums is a very good exercise for teeth and gums.	2.9873977065670285

Do not use toothpick  paper pin.	4.9741755469136635

After extracting tooth surely place another teeth in the empty space.	3.6827504528899047

Our hair increases naturally about 1.25 to 1.5 cm in one month.	3.4357284923659703

There is direct effect of food habits on the rate of growth of length of hair.	3.6990134517259894

Also there is a hereditary pattern in the rate of increase in length of hair.	5.3174482921655235

Often patients come with a problem that their hair grows very slowly in length or do not grow more after growing till a definite length.	2.249959125686198

Such a problem can be distributed in the following types.	4.676781638991393

The rate of growth of length in hair remains very slow.	3.451417585547342

Hair does not increase more after increasing till a definite length.	3.7600919004408806

With merely a little increase in length hair becomes brown and split at the ends.	3.091538092732019

The biggest cause of a problem of this kind is deficiency of nutritious substances and lack of proper care.	5.464078529010876

For the circle of hair to go on smoothly it is extremely necessary for the body to get iron , calcium , etc nutritious substances in the right amount.	3.3988261167424074

This problem also arises because of not applying right oil in hair.	4.775402056995123

Not using the right shampoo is also its cause.	4.134097196088265

From use of harmful chemical comprising oil , shampoo , etc hair ends become split and brown.	2.5346428693232914

Use of dryer on hair roots also stops hair growth and makes them rough and lifeless.	2.9086333248083607

If hair is not trimmed for a long time then also growth of hair gets affected.	3.46181075223033

Because hair ends break on becoming lifeless and hair starts tangling in itself.	2.8860941438476764

Hereditary reason or family pattern is also responsible for hair growth.	3.855001164047468

Because the composition of hair depends on the composition of hair of parents.	4.459448137617141

If deficiencies of nutritious substances are visible in patient then medicine for the purpose of fulfilment of nutritious substances should be given.	3.730087036651988

Also it is important to mind food habits.	6.553333423076869

Meal should comprise all nutritious substances.	5.467382570305292

Definitely consume milk.	14.395789513155936

Use the right ayurvedic oil in hair twice or thrice a week.	3.6028517361351406

Do not use any product consisting of harmful chemicals in hair.	3.149580557898454

Do not use dryer on hair roots.	4.369558154825339

Once a month definitely use henna consisting of herbal mixture in hair.	3.0113918074734642

Save your hair from strong sun and strong wind.	4.9892126784092286

In 4 - 5 weeks definitely get trimming of your hair done.	4.04456161575796

Environmental pollution also stopping its growth makes hair rough and lifeless.	3.624522297579824

Hence one should save hair from environmental pollution also.	4.050524110026961

Because rough and lifeless hair grow very less in length.	4.189326827674747

The main author of the research Friedbert Weiss has said that the mutated bacteria DM CocE of this bacteria is more effective.	2.6533385575141235

Weiss has said that the therapy that makes one quit drug addiction is not much effective but from consumption of cocE for a long time patient gradually reduces the consumption of cocaine himself.	2.9148880482534345

Researchers found during the experiment that the rats remaining in contact with such a bacteria have eaten cocaine in less amount.	2.7869203363052995

The effect of drug was also seen less in rats.	4.149957928432837

Researchers found after a decade possibility of cancer has been found at a high level in patient of high blood sugar.	3.745151840839256

Stock has said that this does not mean that cancer occurs from glucose in blood.	4.218138604667073

But this tumor grows in cells many times faster.	3.962114838069251

From high blood sugar possibility of cancer produced in liver , gall bladder , anus and thyroid has been found more in men.	3.404069063609902

Scientists have studied people from America , Canada , Iceland and along with Europe , Scotland , Britain , Germany , Netherlands , Finland , Italy , Spain , France , Switzerland and Sweden for their research.	2.0419826775331424

In these nine genes besides the genes affecting the level of blood sugar the first gene affecting the effect of insulin is discovered.	3.258517093341077

The results of this study are published in the latest issue of ' Nature Genetics ' magazine.	3.1410454597275796

The most important thing for leading the most successful and complete life is - energy.	3.3066496728471395

There is infinite quantity of energy in every person , the necessity is to use it properly.	3.007618416294059

It is also said that ' if you have talent and energy then you are king , if you have energy but not talent then you are prince , but if you have talent but not energy then you will remain a beggar '.	3.09316755724139

Because of today ' s modern life style our natural energy is used less.	3.458277395924523

Therefore by adopting some rules we can maintain our natural energy by which we can take full enjoyment of healthy life.	2.7918230085825995

We can maintain our energy by nutritious and balanced diet.	4.040942227786198

A healthy diet is 50 percent water based in which fruits and vegetables are included.	3.6539765084245297

Include salad in the meal and by reducing caffeine , meat , dairy , sugar and snacks take nutritious food.	2.740931566747523

Regular exercise is also a brilliant source of increasing energy level.	4.963522516104113

For better health and energy it is very necessary to be aerobically trained because it supplies oxygen to the body.	3.280351062904306

Your lungs , heart , digestion etc will work better only when you are fit.	3.4087682158654613

Research tells that if you have done 12 months of regular exercise then it will be useful for your whole life.	4.1446187501411815

Even then do find at least three days in a week for exercise.	3.8546619570940455

The lower portion of our lungs is larger than upper portion and a correct amount of oxygen is needed for breathing.	2.9914323685902886

Generally taking less deep breaths is common as a result of which several problems also begin to come up in which reduction in energy level is also included.	2.7475272809614157

Therefore take ' power breathing ' at least thrice a day.	3.619900892047539

For this inhale deeply by counting one , hold the breath by counting till four and by counting two , exhale.	2.45786415265645

For example if you inhale deeply for four seconds the hold for 16 seconds and exhale in 8 seconds.	2.3610074296659995

Repeat this process for ten times.	6.140150129935749

In order to renew your energy adopt balanced life style.	3.3765712080277726

When we do a lot of and difficult work then in it energy is reduced in a large quantity and we gain nothing.	3.519884625244612

Therefore in order to become a successful person finish the work by dividing them properly , work after resting a little.	2.9276943251307506

Balanced life is not formed naturally but it is formed by oneself by keeping in mind one ' s daily routine and work habit.	3.4066716218586355

Emotions are also helpful in reducing our energy level to a large extent.	3.839152964758588

Those who live in negative emotions stress , depression or any kind of fear , they have a difficulty in being inspired and encouraged towards life.	2.741872870521187

On the other hand those people who are full of happiness and enthusiasm and who are optimistic have a great energy level.	3.2719133118411103

So adopt positive attitude in life and become optimistic by throwing out tension , fear.	2.707605190353733

There are also many other factors for increasing energy level but you could surely maintain your energy level by adopting these smaller things.	2.4261969394102536

The American researchers have achieved success in finding out a new method for treatment of deep infection.	3.672890536290914

The researchers of New York located Binghamton University have found out three min causes behind formation of bacteria.	2.499777046193362

In the article published in Science Daily the researcher Caarin Soar has told , we have been successful in finding out the causes of formation of biophils group of bacteria.	2.4390441868782227

He said , if we become successful in using this new technique , then we can interfere in the formation process of biophils and the infection occurring due to biophils could be treated.	2.6422332182435007

Soar said , we hope that we can use this research in the treatment of biophils infection.	4.165104147758483

American scientists have claimed to discover such a gene in which the changes are related to heart attack in humans.	3.8991848466090233

According to the report of ' Journal of clinical investigation ' the researchers of Washington School of Medicine have told that changes in HSPB - 7 gene is a big reason behind the heart attack.	2.5642734784564296

According to the researchers heart attack occurs because of many molecular reasons , but among these changes in this gene is one big reason.	2.854946830530611

Researchers are now engaged in finding out many other molecular changes related to heart attack.	3.3111016369228734

According to a new study conducted recently it has come to the fore that the men who have sex at least twice a week , the danger of heart - related diseases becomes almost half in them.	3.1661456090427773

According to this those men who have intercourse regularly , the chances of diseases related to the heart in them reduces by up to 45 percent in comparison to those who have sex once in a month or less than that.	3.688574883280054

In this study 1 ,000 men were included and it was found that sex gives protective base to the heart of men.	3.1635890985044535

Whether it benefits women also or not , there is no observation done regarding this till now.	3.412732403345636

Although sex has been considered good for the physical and the mental health for long time but it has very little scientific proof which could explicitly show to which extent regular sex has a benefit in serious ailment like heart disease.	2.6473949795794347

The problem of pain and stiffness in joints at the onset of winter has become common.	4.145467045974482

Because of the stiffness in muscles even basic movement has become difficult.	3.295777586442454

Old people are most bothered by this problem but because of the changes in lifestyle youth is also not untouched by this because among patients of the most common form of arthritis osteoarthritis only 40 percent are of the age of more than 65 years.	3.36527648420197

The senior orthopaedic consultant of Rockland hospital Dr.P.K.Dave says that osteoarthritis is a result of many deficiencies in which some joints of body stops functioning.	2.5364324807493697

Among these muscles , bones , ligament , joint lining and joint cover are also included.	2.900379265740447

Its symptoms come to the fore very slowly therefore patients could not recognize that they have arthritis.	3.3083281860318565

When swelling and harsh pain begins in joints then the problem is understood.	3.96098158288102

The orthopaedic consultant of AIIMS Dr.Rajesh Malhotra says that the biggest reason behind arthritis is lack of physical exercise.	3.1666694744859423

The lifestyle of working throughout the day in front of computer and lying in front of TV in the evening back at home is leading the most youngsters towards the arthritis.	2.954092350333206

Dr.Malhotra says that the problem escales in the winter because of reduction in physical activity in the winter.	3.8408241568643238

In order to avoid such problems one can take help of jogging , biking.	3.0748736192031982

Cycling is good exercise to prevent arthritis , because the cartilage of the legs and joints become thick by continuous movement of the leg.	3.1490054931914497

Some yogasana could also be very beneficial.	7.324857541578748

The patients of diabetes are very troubled by the stiffness in the shoulder joints.	3.953977030661255

The situation is such that because of the lack of correct information these days every fifth diabetic patient of more than 40 years of age is reaching the hospitals with this problem.	3.3279014830253852

Not only this , doctors say that , people are taking the steroid injections for this problem which could be tackled by keeping the blood glucose level normal and regular exercise which is working to increase the problems even more.	2.449804467097147

The director of Delhi diabetic research center Dr.A.K.Jhingan says that now a days such problems occur because of accumulation of protein in the colossal tissue of joint because people stop exercising etc in the name of cold.	2.554275253810434

Because of stress due to pain the blood sugar level is also muddled which is raising other problems.	3.015252065399688

In such a situation the diabetic patient should remain aware of their diet and regular exercise.	2.9632763610542328

Humans practice so many methods in order to get good health.	5.123587264892034

According to a survey an average of 12 percent of expenses in the annual budget of a common man is spent in the name of being healthy.	2.791382947749689

But in the name of health itself different kinds of myths and misconceptions keep on flourishing among us.	3.275261829508396

Lot of people among us believe that people get more ill in the winter season while the study tell us that diseases spread comparatively less in the winter season.	2.5683947015293533

Second , people become less ill by winter season or cold things , in comparison to other causes.	3.551144040369314

Yes it could be so that in the winter season people do not prefer to come out in the winter season and remains hidden inside the houses , as a result of which it could happen that they come under the effect of germs.	3.808077853125895

But it could happen in any other season also.	5.587080931415119

In relation to the color of cough even some doctors believe that it is an identification or symbol of sinus.	3.364074035277217

While till today no proof or fact could have been produced in its favor.	2.8953971879210774

It could also not be proved that when antibodies begin to decrease because of the disease then green cough is its identification.	3.5735326642874967

In fact it is nothing special.	5.627490539773673

The heat of body comes out of all those body parts which we have not covered by clothes etc.	3.821370389187074

In a research conducted on three hundred patients two third of the patients believed that cough is formed because of drinking milk.	2.9443385982109684

But it has not been proved scientifically.	6.2810358184846935

According to the above study researchers have found that those patients who had viral fever , among them some voluntarily drank milk in large quantity.	2.6946653928665913

Among the patients drinking milk neither cough was formed nor congestion occurred because of this.	2.9762004107740077

It is believed that arthritis occurs by cracking fingers or any other part of body.	3.090214535582906

Till now it could not be proved in any research or case study.	3.5632100793812995

While even this conception does not have even an iota of truthfulness.	4.068368754740176

The real thing is that the contraceptive pills should be taken at the regular time only then they become effective.	4.331640032939597

In the west many people believe that singles have a better emotional and sex life in comparison to the married people while the results of the researches tell this conception as the opposite picture.	2.4685078139583125

It is also half truth that going to the toilet daily is the symbol of clean stomach and if you are not going to the toilet daily then you have constipation or some other disease , but the studies tell that if a person goes to the toilet even three times in a week then he is considered healthy.	3.1201323335710534

It is true that carrot has a large quantity of Vitamin - A which is a necessary nutrient for good eyesight.	3.468791580652797

But it should not be taken to mean that by this the strength of our eyes will increase to become like x - ray vision.	3.7455914602505644

There is no direct relation of eating carrot with increase in the strength of the eyes as such.	4.996854094894183

The truth is that this rumor was spread by the British government during second world war to befool the German army.	2.304337674288321

Nature keeps the body warm by its own methods in the winter season.	3.9404501558986738

This heat is produced from inside the body , the temperature of the body increases by eating food and body becomes capable of fighting the outer environment.	4.6504018477094125

However some edible things have more capacity to keep the body warm.	4.31944937492909

The effect of keeping food warm is called ' diet induced thermogenesis '.	3.0426429145392553

The internal layer of the veins of the penis is called endothelium , which is responsible for producing nitric oxide.	3.485348254483057

This chemical makes the blood vessels wide and keeps them smooth from inside.	3.822120066401981

In this regard in a study done by the Greek and Swiss researchers when 10 gram of deep colored chocolate was given to 17 healthy men then a quick improvement began to come in their endothelial function.	2.4474945020937593

Keep in mind , only that chocolate proves to be very effective in increasing the physical sex - activity in which the amount of coca is at least 70 to 80 percent.	3.6141872117694933

It was first proved on the scientific basis that if a person suffering from the heart arteries related disease takes aspirin daily then he can get help in evading heart attack and strokes.	2.9629552567241557

But now specialists are giving the suggestion not to take it because it has the possibility of more danger than profit.	3.4838953013828355

Since ancient times people have been predicting future on the basis of dreams.	3.6273341930919916

But scientists are not unanimous on reasons behind having dreams and its results.	2.8672363577749103

Some scientists opine that whatever we see in dreams are views encased in our unconscious mind.	2.6345773334264346

While some scientists believe that dreams are the result of electrical activity taking place in our mind.	3.282939220774692

According to scientists dreams are not at all the basis of future and it has got very little proof till now that dreams affect health.	2.6732761838940067

According to a recent study published in the journal of personality and social psychology people of different cultures believe that dreams do have some truth.	2.4334934372908044

Overall researchers have concluded only this that dreams can not predict the incidents to take place in the future , instead of this they do inspire us to think upon our daily life because people work in the same way as they think.	2.7754037468236143

The truth is that we know very little about dreams that we see and the results of these dreams , even though sleep and dreams give us the solution to our serious problems.	2.294638321009321

Dreams could be more frequent by the intake of some special kinds of medicines besides some medicines of the high blood pressure.	3.148702360700671

Pimples are a common problem of young age for which genetic effect has lot of impact.	3.407358515597537

But those youngsters whose father now was suffering from the above problem , their young children had the danger of pimples only twice more.	3.025376948608702

According to the researchers as far as the family or genetic effect in producing pimples is concerned , ' x ' chromosome plays an important role in it.	2.551548290889519

Anyway , in the study besides the family history oily skin is also found to be mainly responsible for the pimples.	3.949389852717907

Banyan has a lot of medicinal value in the Ayurveda medication.	4.813213250716483

Because of this only it will help in stopping the causes that bring old age.	3.498319088032804

It is a common belief that more men are victims of sexual dysfunction.	4.242838125956753

While the truth is opposite to this.	5.487486474645698

Many studies have revealed that women become victim of sexual dysfunction more than men.	3.558901420375909

While 31 percent men are the victims of sexual dysfunction , this rate in the women is 43 percent.	3.993486270915427

This problem reaches in even worse situation in the elderly women.	3.7675805484376252

According to the recent survey report done on 31 , 581 women , the problems of sex desire , excitement or orgasm is found in 44.6 percent women of the age of 45 to 64 years.	3.2357619481069144

While in the women of 18 to 44 age group this figure was of 27.2 percent.	4.272993353130733

But because of depression now even younger women are coming under its influence.	3.259481014221496

The researchers Raj Chirmiya and Itai Bab of Hindu University of Jerusalem have found in their study that there is greater ' bone loss ' in younger women because of depression.	2.6188123503246152

There is reduction in the ' mass ' of bones i.e.hardness because of which bones begin to become weak and that increases the danger of fracture.	3.3604034365589492

This condition is called osteoporosis.	6.666877116236006

Osteoporosis is a common thing in the developed countries.	5.44824445745247

In this problem in some serious cases the person becomes completely paralysed and in some cases he can even die.	3.221894254928164

On analyzing the data from 23 projects of 8 countries the researchers have found that because of depression the danger of bone loss in women especially in young women is greater before the end of their period.	3.0951212066122675

According to the Fred Hetchinson cancer research center and other researchers those women who have a history of migraine a kind of headache they have 26 percent less danger of occurrence of breast cancer.	2.8256532823798994

In this process along with paying attention to alcohol drinking by women , smoking etc it was also considered whether they were taking hormone therapy or not.	2.4144273332740096

The researchers could not know correctly what kind of connection migraine could have with the danger of breast cancer but it is certain that in both conditions women hormone estrogen has a role to play.	2.669896210206565

According to a new research done in Sweden , those men who are not able to express their anger in response to the wrong behavior against them in office , they have twice more chances of having heart attack.	2.4437104475776423

In order to reach this conclusion researchers observed such 2 , 775 men employees of Stockholm , who never had heart attack.	2.2849752689968237

These employees were asked in what way do they fight the anger related to the work ?.	3.3741666839898143

Do they express their anger or remain silent ?.	4.397958231866705

Does headache or stomach ache start after the anger ?.	4.063659525528437

Do they bring out the anger of office at the home ?.	3.6531630246475135

These employees were also asked regarding their habit of intoxication - like intake of liquor and smoking , disease especially diabetes work pressure etc.	2.1782310511682677

Besides this the blood pressure , body - mass index and cholesterol level of people involved in the study were also noted down.	2.8533249467013273

The average age of all people included in the study was 41 years , when the study was started in between 1992 and 1995.	3.727882244639969

The conclusion of the study that ran till 2003 was that those men who were good at tackling the current situation , in comparison to them , those men who used to hide the anger they had twice more danger of heart attack or dieing by the heart disease.	2.6201812070796033

Not only the drugs like cocaine , LSD , heroin have bad impact on the mind , but the steroid containing medicines like prednison , dexamethalon and hydrocortisone given to treat other problems like asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , skin diseases and allergy also have a bad impact on the mind.	2.0814399091743616

As a result , the problems related to common sense could occur in those taking these medicines.	3.2405034519511364

Among these -- problem in concentration , lack of alertness , inability to recall what one has said and inability to retain some thing , incident etc in the memory etc could be included.	2.255041753588915

In fact the effect of the above medicines could end completely.	4.552752797702482

In most of the patients included in the study after ending the corticosteroid therapy of the healthy patients their memory becomes normal.	2.9640841069572637

Because of being busy in the work and the family responsibilities generally couples have sex only after eleven at night but the truth is that the level of testosterone in the men is at its peak in the morning and the quality of sperms is at its best after the afternoon.	2.569657578465447

As far as the women getting pregnant is concerned , they generally become pregnant just before ovaries are formed in only those 6 days when the membrane of their cervix remain transparent , flexible and sticky.	2.384818170117609

But scientists have till now not able to understand whether the time of sex is also a factor in the cases of successful pregnancy.	4.04639478514004

The tasty breakfast taken in the morning not only gives you energy throughout the day , along with it also puts control over the habit of overeating.	3.822969638163219

In reality our hunger is more satiated by eating in the morning in comparison to eating in the evening.	4.2443612291994075

If we agree with some studies then in the elderly and those who wake up early , attentiveness , concentration , alertness and logical power is at its peak around the afternoon.	2.5015140221929366

Therefore those works which needs more mental exercise to get completed , do them in the morning and keep the lighter works for the evening.	2.9840897563315236

According to Dr.Hanimann every person is born with a poison named ' Sora ' , which is capable of producing numerous kinds of eruptions in the skin.	2.379321984470343

This very poison is the father of most of the diseases.	4.348597757391425

Nature wants to keep the internal organs disease - free by taking it out in the form of ' skin diseases ' but because of suppressing it with lotions etc several diseases like asthma occurs in the body.	3.5759565303879146

In the treatment of all diseases there is a need to give medication while removing all these ills.	4.229705967153118

In all the situations all the diseases appear with one or the other symptoms.	4.457696274942932

By giving medication on the basis of these symptoms only the patient becomes healthy in the complete sense.	3.8457468948936526

Spine related disease scoliosis that produces trouble of heart and lung has been the subject of speculation for ages.	3.0241433872556853

At our place until now people have considered it untreatable whereas in modern medical science its treatment has become quite easy and satisfactory.	2.3563975365762166

From the negligence of which either there can be a hump back or another kind of distortion may occur in the spine.	3.2638739640451213

Along with a hump permanent freedom from other disorders of spine is possible.	3.307029892128548

According to Dr.Sharma the organization of spine is such that bending of it forwards backwards left - right is possible.	2.5265899386343538

His statement is that there is a disc in the center of vertebra and behind this disc from the center of spine a spinal canal passes the nerves within which go from the brain towards hands and feet.	2.5912974058298235

His statement is that this disc happens to be soft and flexible like rubber through which this spine provides flexibility to the spine.	2.865520145799686

According to Dr.Sharma the cause of abnormal growth in spine has not been detected yet whereas in other causes there are congenital deficiencies like absence of one - two bones or presence in half or being joint together.	2.2787110171522156

According to him due to unknown reasons number of patients of spine disorder is up to 60 to 70 % , it is called idiopathic scoliosis and 20 to 25 percent patients get this disease because of congenital causes which is called congenital scoliosis.	2.961775575233661

According to him many patients get hump related spine disorders that occur from weakness arising in muscles due to paralysis which is called paralytic scoliosis.	2.4317506087253107

According to Dr.Manoj Sharma treatment of hump is normally done to end ugliness because these diseases are found more in girls.	2.9067482964621516

According to Dr.Sharma from extreme distortion there can be an effect on lungs and heart hence its treatment is important.	3.1540404929874457

Dr.Sharma says that some distortion can treat itself with age and for it only appropriate exercise or braces jacket is proper but if hump is too much then it goes on increasing with time and patient may land in quite a distorted state.	2.265952946241121

Also he can become helpless physically.	6.283828100744631

According to Dr.Sharma treatment of people is possible only through surgery.	4.12708540585945

According to him these days treatment of hump distortion of back is done according to scientific technique derotation of apical vertebra.If distortion has become excessive or quite old then it is straightened after making it flexible through endoscopic technique.	2.1596317077165805

According to Dr.Sharma inserting endoscope in chest or stomach many discs are taken out from distorted spine , after this spine becomes straight easily.	2.3747870730323934

Earlier this task used to happen through major surgery opening up chest or stomach in which a lot of blood used to flow and recovery of patient was possible after many days and often death of patient used to take place.	2.582986023192533

Other than this because of occurrence of extreme strain on the spinal cord while straightening out the back there is danger of occurrence of paralysis in feet.To prevent such a situation nerves are also monitored side by side during operation.	2.916061531931144

He says that if it is not treated while there is time then this disorder takes a form and patient becomes ugly.Disease becomes chronic on growing too much.	2.891019881153734

Colon descending colon is like a sewer line for the whole body.From its cleansing removal of disease of the whole body along with the stomach diseases is certain.	3.977736335906808

When chuckles of a baby echo in the house then the whole family is filled with happiness but just imagine that you child like playing , developing physically like ordinary children but suddenly being 7 years old has started to look like a 60 year old.	2.2882014575714176

Perhaps this situation is a little strange to you.	5.177598227711428

There are such innumerable diseases that we are unaware of , progeria is one of them.	3.1688191868411133

Progeria is such a disease a child afflicted with which grows like ordinary children but till the age of seven years.	3.5216194257937685

After that such a turn comes in his life which changes his whole life.	3.136800326281986

It seems like someone has pressed the fast forward button of his life and he finds himself in the period of senility.	2.8113728564976457

It is the only such family in India where more than one child is in the grips of this disease.	3.727348955665312

Parents of Ali and Ikramul are Bisul Khan and mother Razia.	2.8883697821060728

They are total seven brothers and sisters from which 5 children are victims of progeria.	3.1075036589438976

One out of which had an untimely death , the other got killed because of pneumonia.	3.1238339693113186

That is to say that it is such a disease the prevention of which can not be made from prior assumption.	4.818767464485631

A child who is of 11 years of age whose weight should be 25 - 30 kg , height should be 134 - 135 cm his weight is 12 kg and height is 116.9 cm.	2.8697025992607066

No doubt that were made like ordinary children by feeding but the age gap that they have completed in merely a few years will never end.	2.585700484215823

They are mentally absolute children but have had aged in body.	3.1795054941918055

There are many types of progeria.	6.26346879594572

Out of which Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome H.G.P.S is also one.	2.980780710503637

The symptoms of this disease are decrease in body fat , formation of wrinkles in skin , reduction of hair.	3.264061451993807

All those things which are in an old man.	5.8278798573153905

Dr.Ajay Mukherjee has made the statement that it is possible that there is no method of prevention of this situation but it has been seen in the past few years that if some changes are made in their lifestyle and food habits then life can be a bit better.	3.2591686891634697

Despite this the reality is that the normal life that others are leading they happen to be miles away from them.	3.1511483646232

They are physically weak.	10.057553073318692

Therefore they become sensitive from even a little sports.	4.6732846828308565

They have to go through every such situation through which elderly have to go through.	3.3543291811052414

Meaning osteoporosis , arthritis , skin related diseases rather they need the help of others for every small task.	3.235686919269491

They even need help to change clothes.	4.966211184172483

This has also been detected from a recent study that the children afflicted with progeria that die of ' atherosclerosis heart related disease ' their average age is 13 years.	2.8960151753751604

However it has been seen traditionally that age of patients is on an average around 20 years.	3.617554565937565

As of now these children know everything , understand and they even know that their age is not very long and yet they try to lead their life in a way different from others.	2.487466455726072

Water therapy has a dominant position in the therapy - order of naturopathy.	3.3726140263782463

According to the point of view of Louis Kuhne often the main cause of diseases in most people is the accumulation of stool in descending colon.	3.006590376340889

Currently the only naturopathic simple cure for cleansing or washing descending colon is enema.	2.8477016307805205

Pain reduces at that very time or in a little time.	5.483584321971106

Without enema one can not imagine the therapy course of naturopathy.	3.9664138577787655

Detoxification of descending colon through enema and diet - change these two are the main foundation pillars of natural therapy.	2.557509979779329

A naturopath can start therapeutic work only through the means of enema - pot.	3.1272309185367733

If there is only enema pot in the hands of therapists that travel in villages even then he can treat successfully in various situations.	2.966367499285313

Normally without a catheter use of enema can as such happen.	3.479764104715986

For children , elderly and weak patients there is convenience in getting up water through a catheter.	3.0493824194626997

Otherwise there is possibility of nozzle coming out by the speed of water , gas or stool.	3.244874166476542

If he is weak or of less life force then you should give him enema of 19 ° - 100 ° water.	3.589828737086288

Enema pot should normally be kept at a height of 2 to 3 feet.	3.8498327591497254

In a special situation when the intestines of a patient are weak , there is swelling , injury , ulcer or wound in intestines then one should keep enema pot at a maximum height of one foot and minimum half a foot.	2.7150128312553883

By this water will reach intestines at a very low speed otherwise stomach starts aching with the speed of water.	2.7571555914463466

There is fear of shock reaching the soft walls inside the colon.	3.530661883519576

Before inserting nozzle of enema inside the anus some water should be first taken out of it.	3.6889852014512883

The air filled inside the tube should come out.	4.583348532274979

You should apply oil on nozzle or catheter while giving enema.	3.5196885997380907

So that it is able to enter anus easily.	7.153212300926606

So that no friction occurs in the inner skin.	6.751140636798147

By breathing deeply entrance of water inside is facilitated.	4.405506940335337

Water is pulled inside the intestines by deep breathing.	3.9774185056171896

After enema water has gone inside by doing an action like bhastika moving stomach up and down water that has reached inside the intestines exits taking out stool.	2.287632931353196

If there is inconvenience in stopping enema water then before taking enema itself give a hot - cold compress to stomach for 10 - 15 minutes.	2.4606631820830867

By doing ordinary hot compress also there is help in expulsion of stool.	3.739528807879424

Enema water starts going inside with speed or water stays cold then sometimes there is stomach-ache.	2.922258343156102

At that time one should immediately stop water from entering inside.	4.111657536906131

One should allow water to enter slowly on stopping of pain.	3.4264862081465792

To stop water you can press enema - tube with finger.	3.5361552135967

If there is a clip then it can be used.	5.904674311655727

If on doing this also there is pain in passage of water then water should be made to reach the intestines with less speed reducing the enema - pot height.	3.7356049733953443

Pain reduces by this also.	8.254885695448687

Process of giving enema : -.	10.230447174497321

By making him lie still on his back - this method is comfortable for patient.	3.4729233110832927

One should give enema to extremely weak patients only after making him lie still.	3.6399867295961625

This condition is appropriate for diseases like typhoid , cholera.	4.65782725176874

By this there is no chance of any kind of shock reaching the intestines of patient which are already weak.	4.307070974727815

My making him lie down on right side : -.	6.143866305849136

This state is considered right for patients of moderate health.	4.182593640232062

While making the patient lie down one should keep in mind that right leg is straight and left one is slightly bent.	3.443184700538725

However right leg should also be kept loose not keeping it taut.	4.497077721571385

By this no pressure may be there on anus.	4.5112583721016595

By doing this one can insert nozzle inside easily.	3.7567066031819603

There is also ease in water going inside.	4.111551759763643

Making him lie down on left side : -.	7.156408298110395

Enema is not given in this condition often.	7.923764886175437

When one needs to take water in less quantity and needs to clean only rectum and descending colon only then it is appropriate to give enema in this situation.	2.994370301854958

By giving enema this way enema water can be made to reach maximum only till the center of transverse colon.	3.124599940284549

One can not make it reach the ascending colon.	4.062594250065336

It is impossible in this condition.	6.5838142363609435

If taking one - one and a half pint water one needs to clean only the rectum then this condition can be considered adequate.	2.888583413217682

One should not allow enema water to go beyond transverse colon in appendicitis.	2.8883858708830656

One should not allow any kind of shock to reach wall of intestine.	3.730558122132421

This state is only appropriate.	7.24794369840953

Because water of enema can not go diagonal further than the descending colon.	3.6043025727377787

Making one lie down upside down on the chest or on the stomach : -.	4.854768102297583

The man who has difficulty stopping water immediately has urge of defecation on taking water.	2.821299774355623

For this this situation causes a lot of benefit in stopping the water easily.	4.0482630072347945

A patient had to take water in the toilet itself out of fear of expulsion of water.	3.9521613688237944

He was given enema in this condition on the very first day and no difficulty occurred in stopping water.	3.422242713188063

Anyhow due to some reason if difficulty occurs in stopping water then water also stops by keeping the anus pressed with fingers.	3.1349155831357525

Bending the chest on knees : -.	8.74580854225926

Leaving a weak man for a healthy man taking enema in this situation is beneficial from many points of view.	3.4723624649105083

Anus remains quite high as compared to intestine.	5.740939478880586

From this water may reach inside descending colon very easily.	3.6745872800775508

Along with this on water filling up fully inside descending colon one does not need to make any kind of attempt to stop water because of location of anus being a little high.	2.76885039591581

Water remains blocked automatically by it.	5.154245214436715

In this situation while taking enema one should keep a small soft pad underneath the knees.	3.4721241627337

By this patient will have no trouble in knees while taking enema.	4.0151462872823105

For a healthy man whose stool has come into the rectum and one needs to use enema only to expel stool.	3.156137914226619

That stool comes out by one pint normal cold water.	4.199325752070248

In this state there is no need to mix anything in the water.	4.759438102974435

Rectum gets stimulation by this.	6.917714534179966

The quantity of salt in in four pint water should be maximum two tolas and minimum one tola.	3.2878546449706896

Brine has the property that descending colon is unable to absorb this water easily.	3.837136753288214

This water staying in intestine brings help in thinning and expelling stool.	3.0087172432540177

Mixing decoction of neem leaves : - this water is antiseptic.	4.8007131889875945

The chemical property of neem is cool therefore it reduces the additional heat of colon.	2.74691909570334

Destroys the worms of colon.	8.187228398823796

Garlic being antiseptic and because of being acrid destroys germs.	4.973217719687312

Quantity of garlic becoming in excess by mistake or unknowingly burning sensation in eyes occurs.	3.1923610234842763

Heat of body increases by this.	7.191173841246361

There remains a chance of distress to the patient.	5.419284746866993

Squeezing lemon juice : - Enema of this water helps in expelling gas.	3.9844141900763486

You can use minimum one or maximum two lemons in four pint water.	2.902616827843462

There are two ways of mixing lemon in water.	3.7931188392563038

While giving enema if some water one pint or half pint remains then you should add lemon juice in water.	3.187889957030759

This way by mixing a little juice in water urge to defecate begins strongly.	3.7809054101671835

Lemon brings a lot of help in separating old stool from colon.	4.0902339814408375

Making the patient lie on right side one should give oil to patient through a syringe.	3.86181837875286

After that one may give water of enema as per requirement.	4.622430889455613

By making oil reach first smoothness comes in colon walls.	3.2884108563922667

After this water on reaching gets rid of stool easily.	4.025756810746506

When there is pain in stomach , because of staying in large quantity if old stool keeps pricking inside stomach , there is gas in stomach and stool - urine is obstructed then enema happens to be extremely useful.	3.249580792410851

The patient in whose stomach enema water stops , is unable to come out easily , on usage oil by him also with the above mentioned method obstruction of water will reduce or not.	2.6250898164594507

By chance if water has stopped then because of entrance of oil in colon flatulence of colon will come out easily.	2.8679053173594147

By this water will also try to come out because oil is a laxative substance.	3.946368709200866

Cause of passage of water inside not happening : -.	5.178473887532301

Sometimes while giving enema water does not enter colon.	4.967138747301733

It stays where it was in the enema pot.	3.574602026130834

Its causes are : - Enema - Stool getting stuck on mouth of enema - nozzle and catheter.	2.824839642232239

Because of this water is unable to come out of mouth of nozzle and water stays stable where it was in the enema pot.	3.1699607091674835

In this condition the part of nozzle or catheter which is inside the anus.	3.8429084513800382

It should be moved up - down slowly.	4.769988922121029

The faeces that might be stuck on the mouth of the nozzle will be lost and water will start entering inside easily.	2.85581147172447

The other reason is presence of stiff pieces on the anus itself.	3.4695130832836676

The shape and type of this stool is also of such a type that it sits properly on the anal opening.	2.86481022725802

On such an occasion one should take out faeces breaking it inserting the fore finger inside the anus.	2.922440940301318

After this water of enema will be able to enter inside easily.	5.065428151808234

When stiff stool is full in the descending part from the descending colon then there is obstruction of stool and urine both.	3.042307756113989

On such an occasion one should make use enema of glycerine or any oil.	3.0780921486286457

One may well not be able to make all the oil inside but on the entrance of even a little oil inside stimulus arises on anus from the contact of oil.	2.798820842676077

From the pressure of this stimulus stool comes out.	5.218812086498869

On such an occasion descending colon expands a little on fomenting the stomach with hot water and stool also softens a little.	2.4746082816797306

By this there is facilitation of entrance of water inside.	4.538425476195028

In a specific situation where there is swelling in the uterus and more pressure is exerted by it on the rectum then also water does not enter inside.	3.6141598109561435

While giving enema to an old woman even the catheter of enema did not enter straight inside , it used to get twisted going a little far.	2.444641673501627

There was so much expansion and swelling in her uterus that from its pressure the walls of rectum had almost met each other.	2.6586610264337787

Water entered inside only after this.	5.879010610487659

Enema of half to one pint of water : -.	5.152954864838589

Enema of such less water is beneficial to patient after a prolonged fast or in an extremely weak condition from other reasons.	3.205213851643957

By using water even a little more than requirement patient will feel fatigue or water produces gas , heaviness , restlessness and nervousness by stopping in the descending colon.	2.6970419245581905

When on entering the rectum stool strongly urges the patient to defecate.	3.7575022983174295

If faeces is not coming out because of absence of strength of throwing faeces in intestines.	3.4596238898705787

Only then enema of such less water would be effective.	3.847008501941241

In such a condition how much water should one take , its decision should be made in this manner.	3.100516403386655

Filling up one or one and a half pint water in box of enema one should start taking enema as prescribed.	2.8657534601303967

On entrance of water in rectum the urge to defecate will gradually increase.	4.469530591911813

When urge to defecate increases so much that one can not stop its pressure then immediately stopping water of enema from going inside giving the patient a pot for defecation you should induce him to defecate.	2.505785543494456

You should make one defecate only on making him lie down on a bed pan or rubber cloth.	2.9420243089742875

There is convenience in sitting and defecating only in presence of energy or agility for sitting.	2.970504642239594

When rectum bloats on filling up more than necessary then its pressure is exerted on the urinary bladder.	3.417085588548849

Rectum and urinary bladder have an inverse relationship.	4.8606745973558985

During the aforementioned obstruction use of oily water enema is the best remedy.	3.7528381494119087

There is a possibility of delay from enema of plain water.	3.3052926475307687

Because of lubrication of oil stool comes out easily.	4.276930640791022

Because of extreme constipation many small - large lumps form.	3.842725472923547

During this time one should keep taking catheter or nozzle completely out of anus intermittently so that lump comes out with water.	3.1698356193221255

Sometimes lumps of weak patient stop anus.	4.646108967854149

At that time entrance of water also becomes impossible.	5.14063548127918

At such an occasion one should give enema only after taking stool out with the help of fingers.	3.9853874163528515

After entrance of water of enema in stomach of patient of extreme constipation stool starts coming out extremely fast.	4.340638566438667

Taking patient to the toilet or making him lie down in a bed pan also becomes impossible and stool keeps coming out in between even after trying.	2.914655767775325

Therefore one should give enema to patient with faeces - urine obstruction making him lie down on a rubber sheet.	3.3479262911088066

In presence of strength one should give patient enema bending him on his knee - chest or making him lie down flat on the back.	2.7320214838956987

For vaginal irrigation all other devices except nozzle are for enema only.	2.9457254082973847

Nozzle of vaginal irrigation nozzle is slightly long and turned in a circular shape and its head is a bit round.	2.766986595289885

There are 9 - 10 tiny holes in it.	5.8227279903016855

From it water of douche entering inside like a fountain cleans everything coming in contact with all parts.	2.9498489932533807

Because of mucous membrane of vagina being extremely sensitive one should clean it with a fountain nozzle.	3.0755032912737295

Cot like an enema cot of vaginal irrigation may be 4 - 6 inches long like a leg.	2.9186447106205065

There should be a round hole in the center of the cot of 9 inch or 1 foot diameter.	3.060985425720915

So that water of vaginal irrigation falls only in the pots and pans kept underneath that round hole.	3.0822417633150625

It is necessary to take enema before vaginal irrigation so that pressure of stool obstructed in the rectum does not fall on uterus.	2.826616889512582

One should use neem leaf for vaginal irrigation.	4.2108902015084055

To clean the uterus from inside there is convenience in releasing dirt with lukewarm water of neem leaf.	2.8414026369835996

Normally water of vaginal irrigation should not be hotter than 180 - 1000 Fahrenheit.	4.966693502241136

On occurrence of swelling or pain in uterus one should bring in use 1020 - 1030 Fahrenheit slightly hot water.	3.1934162839846154

If there are blisters , injuries and burning sensation inside the uterus then one should give vaginal irrigation of cold water of neem leaf.	3.601878023180561

One should use lukewarm water in absence of burning sensation.	5.28199752608446

Normally after giving vaginal irrigation of hot or lukewarm water one should give vaginal irrigation of pure cold water.	3.00373462607696

Cold vaginal irrigation is appropriate for muscular weakness and unnatural heat of body.	3.224373896739458

When should you avoid enema.	6.288738764555802

Some people think that by going on taking enema for a long time in indisposed condition one develops the habit of enema ending the natural strength of intestines to expel stool.	2.8063155299349605

Experience has it that until there is no strength in intestines to expel stool out and one does not have an appetite because of that or starts decreasing.	3.382744338686373

Or other problems restlessness , nervousness , etc occur then enema is beneficial from the point of view of bringing help to the task of intestines.	2.741606336164444

If excretion does not happen despite a strong urge to defecate and because of it if an unfavourable effect takes place on disposition and health then one should take enema.	3.1599940230663357

Otherwise in the deficiency of stool - removal - strength ready stool starts drying up in the rectum.	4.223992971761383

Sometimes its shape even starts increasing.	5.511998579652081

In such a condition during excretion fear of bleeding from occurrence of injury in anus remains.	3.5877525685087948

One should stool of patient of piles dry up.	4.989478683132571

During the days of less food or fasting stool does not come out because of adequate pressure.	3.543121510332218

By increasing diet in this condition loose motions start taking place.	4.114281999821586

If patient or a healthy person is not having a specific problem because of defecation not taking place then there is no need to worry.	3.2551504736359043

From a hot lumbar bath all parts of abdomen become soft getting hot.	3.189574210080055

Later when that part is immersed in cold water.	4.514839077330625

Then the pores and blood vessels of that part constrict and the blood pressure that has come up goes towards the inner side.	4.330876613039685

Because of physical impurity blood distribution is unable to take place properly in the fine capillaries of upper and inner part of body.	3.0686494325530416

In that condition lumbar bath helps.	5.497230992254357

The pores that are immersed in water also assist in expelling dirt becoming active through innumerable holes in the form of sweat.	2.8626380266081957

Your stomach is naturally in the shape of your closed fist.	4.204670028937548

As a single muscle it expands and contracts according to use.	3.100601722724938

When it is full it expands.	5.687855076137812

When it is empty it returns towards its initial shape.	3.3718418833265353

While sleeping scenes on TV that startle or distress.	3.360505276912148

By sleeping wearing tight clothes or on a dirty bed.	3.7939806223986903

In the context of joints operations of knees and hips are mainly taken into account.	2.809380536453743

In the place of deformed hips and joints joint replacement is a successful and safe surgery.	3.162352065979306

It is true that in winters joints pain is too much.	4.088812131034141

As long as joints are concerned one can do surgery of deformed knees and hips in any season.	2.6994650067448176

This because now all standards of facilities have changed.	3.4782167225964034

Now surgery happens in a completely air conditioned operation theater.	3.5942565390739016

Rooms are also air conditioned.	7.178150209675075

Hence one can get successful joints related surgery done in months of January or June too.	2.9846027543779194

No matter which season there is no effect on the process of operation.	6.244276277988204

Besides all this one aspect of truth is also that injuries heal in the winter season much too fast as compared to the summer season.	2.888279274048375

As compared to summer situations of occurrence of infection also decrease in winters.	4.025401843322107

So one also has to give less medicines to the patient and patients too get better too soon.	3.6952462759751277

In summers there is more use of antibiotics and patient also has to take more precautions.	4.772970468289465

Anorexia Nervosa is a disease occurring often in adolescent girls.	4.588199570868087

In this disease fear of getting fat pervades the heart of patient.	3.4884699481026615

Patient thinks that he  she is too fat.	5.1715383414216

Therefore patients start making a cutback in their food.	3.944737378259132

As a result they become victims of malnutrition.	5.196114267089317

To look healthy and fit - fine its not only important for body parts to be strong but positive thinking also has meaning.	2.419135894083659

Those who get restless soon and are unable to make the right decisions are not paying attention to their fitness in my opinion.	3.343503497735876

Hence it is important that focussing your mind and body you exercise.	4.132451876466113

Exercising is my hobby.	9.31157867101781

This is the very reason that I exercise as soon as I wake up.	3.277177065075184

Not only your body but your mind also becomes strong from regular exercise and you can handle yourself even in a difficult situation.	2.830231137523864

By going on taking the required amount of ' Rub - i - anar ' 2 - 3 times a day excess thirst , weakness of liver , complaints of eating mud or coal get away.	2.5060834901547824

The total mount of iron in body is 4 - 5 grams.	5.097326912305009

In this about 70 % iron is coupled with hemoglobin in red blood cells.	3.1512950363028476

About 20 - 23 % iron is stored in various tissues in the form of ferretin and hemosiderin.	3.655057233965499

One finds the problem of iron deficiency in about half the population of the world.	4.472179997602924

It has become known from researches that more than half men and two - third women in our country are afflicted with anemia.	2.7657627256182495

Tissues get damaged from excess of iron also , even death can occur.	3.5022169817248345

An adult needs 1 mg of iron everyday.	4.835048893558376

Iron is in abundance in eggs , fish.	4.4611657639780224

We call this iron ' haem iron '.	5.070337949507424

Its absorption from intestines is about 10 % whereas iron is also present in green leafy vegetables , cereals , pulses , their absorption by intestines happens with less ease.	2.6336977169900027

So possibility of iron deficiency in vegetarians is more.	4.626552772806168

Amount of iron in body being less its absorption by intestines increases whereas being more it decreases.	3.0761246878001507

If absorbed iron in intestines is in free form then its extremely harmful , it is insoluble and is unable to be used in body.	2.6543162618406515

In blood iron remains attached to protein Transferrin.	3.8929190183546085

98 % is used in bone marrow , red blood cells for production of hemoglobin.	4.597177871096891

It enters cells through blood and stays attached to ferretin protein in cells , in this form iron is soluble and less harmful.	2.3699845236828936

Body can use them on occurrence necessity.	5.236092317750985

If amount of ferretin increases in cells then it converts to insoluble hemosidrine which can be harmful for body.	2.844673650423233

About one gram iron in body is stored mainly in liver cells and macrophage.	3.3500932407168964

On occurrence of necessity of iron stored in body body uses it.	3.230925110630239

One can detect the excess or deficiency of iron from blood iron level , transferrin and ferretin in body.	3.0769892070982814

Deficiency of iron in body can be because of its absence in sufficient amount in food , absorption of iron present in vegetarian food happens with less ease , so possibility of deficiency is more.	2.560837545169717

Requirement of iron increases in childhood , youth , pregnancy.	4.540660160577128

So if it is not consumed in additional amount then there may be deficiency.	4.795944758659784

Because of less absorption of iron in old age possibility of occurrence of anemia can increase.	4.27995557117432

If iron comes out of body with blood by bleeding even then deficiency of iron occurs in body.	3.7257816258607015

Deficiency of iron also occurs by occurrence of infection of blood sucking hookworms in intestines , excessive bleeding during periods in women , bleeding from intestines or other parts of body.	2.7624859357500777

In the poverty line special danger of iron deficiency remains in children , women , elderly people that do not drink milk.	2.9272623917550926

In the second trimester of pregnancy somewhat all women become victims of iron deficiency.	2.694509158598502

In the second trimester of pregnancy somewhat all women become victims of iron deficiency.	2.694509158598502

If iron pills  capsules are consumed for a long time in a large amount or more iron reaches inside body from other reasons then it starts accumulating in the various body parts of body specially liver , muscles of heart , endocrinal glands.	2.7473324076717

By which tissues get damaged.	6.809470706911386

Tissues get damaged by the effect of active free radical being produced because of excess of iron.	3.6338400065020293

When more blood needs to be put up at regular intervals because of thalassemia , sickle cell anemia , etc then iron starts accumulating in body in a larger amount.	2.7357621737691997

In some individuals absorption of iron from intestines happens in excessive amount because of which there may be excess of iron in body.	3.450539140736416

This disease is often hereditary because of abnormality in genes.	3.742742984106056

We call this disease ' Haemosiderosis '.	6.474071408068687

On entrance of iron in large amount in body spots occur on skin.	4.318381731790671

Diabetes can occur from pancreas getting damaged.	5.793556139332203

Cirrhosis may occur from damaged liver , danger of liver cancer increases.	3.6022244739261704

The seminal vesicles of men may get destroyed.	3.3313544012356755

Weakness , fatigue occurs , can become impotent , weight decreases , swelling and pain occurs in joints , nausea , vertigo occur.	2.8162446940985095

Size of liver may increase , hair falls , abdominal fluid retention may occur , Heart diseases may occur.	2.6694559858908185

Test of excess of iron can be measure of transferrin , ferretin levels , biopsy of liver.	3.0658859391041204

Iron being in excess can be fatal , hence to expel it from body injections of ferrol are given regularly.	2.406017512053498

This treatment is difficult and extremely expensive.	4.697367034041136

Now medicine that makes iron from body ineffective which can also be eaten in the form of a capsule has been developed.	3.4979865988325587

Hopefully it will soon be available in our country as well.	3.699799401503461

In patients of hereditary homosiderosis 450 ml blood is taken out every week so that there may be no excess of iron.	3.108657275486195

By this treatment there remains no chance of death from their heart , liver diseases.	3.8845302629345575

Nowadays one hears it said often that so and so person has got allergy.	2.7400200654291895

The more the use of modern synthetic medicines is increasing the more outbreak of allergy is going on increasing.	2.9966791071802055

Diseases have been mentioned in ayurveda by the names of Sheetpitta , Udard and Kotha.They are included in allergies of today.	2.628948534496041

Allergy or sheetapitta is a reaction of body which is produced by touching or eating those substances that are unfavourable to the constitution of people.	3.112334966770346

Being favourable to the constitution is called shastra - satmya and unfavourable is called asatmya.	2.8924263208968273

Some people get an allergy from wearing clothes made of synthetic thread.	3.137459755946966

These people develop symptoms of allergy from consumption of some special English medicines , breathing speed increases.	3.3645896030129805

Nerve becomes weak and even death occurs from shock and nervousness.	3.787648408744616

These medicines becoming asatmya can also become marak  deadly for people.	3.593888439628188

Those who get an attack of sheetpitta or allergy should immediately use medicine.If they themselves do not succeed in arrangements then they without losing time they should send in a good hospital or doctor.	2.1554966729562914

That ayurvedic medicines also benefit less in them is not the case.	4.340891642558489

Not feeling sleepy or feeling less sleepy is surely a disease but feeling too sleepy is also a disease , it has been called ' insomnia '.	2.678549625786215

Many people stay afflicted with insomnia.	5.798389590921475

Following use remains of benefit to patients.	5.997182171734126

Grind fennel coarsely , boil an amount of 6 grams of it in 400 grams of water until 100 grams remains then drink mixing a pinch of rock salt.	3.038213840317053

Do this morning - evening.	8.996635232432544

You will get rid of insomnia.	7.135373044736357

If one were to not take care of hands , feet , nose and ears in severe cold then problem may increase.	3.010145701234057

Tips of hands , feet , nose and ears go red in winter.	3.7178677281681978

Itching starts in it.	9.900356835435634

If it is scratched instead of being taken care of then it turns into injuries.	3.269443013848281

It is a common disease occurring in winter days.	4.241067358726107

Which heals by itself on temperature increasing.	4.664041482746836

If proper care is not taken then they turn from red to blue marks.	2.99096403316546

Later injury also occurs in them.	7.399770044299122

Chance of occurrence of gangrene by it remains.	6.225590749888558

Prevent using medicine yourself.	9.014224583455462

It is a common disease occurring in winter days.	4.241067358726107

Stay wearing gloves in hands , socks in feet , shoes as far as possible.	2.85219740796305

Keep nose and ear covered.	7.098870299906595

Do fomentation adding one spoon salt in lukewarm water.	4.244850688848563

Do not use too hot water because fingers go numb on getting red.	3.1617078800216323

Because of miraculous progress happening in the medical world it has now become possible to treat many diseases without the help of surgery.	3.272233654427745

Adenomyosis is such a disease of women to get rid of which their uterus itself is removed.	4.688185525980784

It is one such disease detection of which is not easy.	5.73086530552024

Due to presence of lining tissue endometrium very much inwards in endomyometrium layer of muscles of uterus size of uterus increases.	2.4344478904135114

We call this condition itself endomyosis but treatment of this disease is possible without an operation with the help of uterine artery embolization.	3.5718564961284427

Treatment of endomyosis does not happen with medicines.	5.381798517224575

Its treatment is operation only but if myomectomy and laparoscopic surgery is done in this condition then problem can increase more.	3.348828459673573

Actually one can not call adenomyosis fibroid either.	5.1784983836263345

More bleeding can occur in a woman suffering from adenomyosis but now to be free of all these problems uterine artery embolization technique is available.	3.4032274517749697

Through this modern technique treatment is done by making extremely fine holes in skin.	3.7237707016358135

In this process afflicted woman is not made unconscious and patient has to stay in hospital only for a day.	3.1623920198288804

After this process most women start working normally after two days and it is not necessary to take the uterus out.	3.887142535208816

Not only this pain occurring from bleeding also heals in four to six hours.	3.2361008927218315

Success of this technique has been estimated to be 95 to 97 percent.	5.0692285050319255

If a woman is suffering from both diseases adenomyosis and fibroid then by this technique treatment of both the diseases is possible at the same time.	3.6600617013416405

The former American foreign minister Condoleeza Rice got the treatment of fibroid done by the technique of artery embolization.	3.5099838749425385

If you want to keep your heart fit then you should be familiar with the talent of beating stress.	3.2699468987516145

There is adverse effect of mental stress and tension on your health and heart.	4.13301918261555

Stress , challenges and grievous incidents are a part of life.अस्थाई तौर पर जीवन में कभी न कभी सभी को इनसे दोचार होना पड़ता है ।.	3.7395324862102792

Still staying stressed constantly is harmful for your health and especially fitness of your heart.	3.790724868951352

The role of social relations is important in reducing stress.	3.9598392299237823

In our country people in connected with family planning provide safety to each other.	2.8159298101236816

Spare time for meditation.	9.474670751701153

It has been proved from a research held recently that those afflicted with coronary heart disease who have meditated for five years in them the possibility of occurrence of heart attack and stroke reduces by more than 40 percent.	2.780305631603328

The way vitamins of ' B ' group are helpful in the of a disease called macular degeneration.	3.6579124853774876

Similarly zinc is important for the strength of immunity system of body.	5.747131010069793

Magnesium and phosphorous make bones strong.	5.294404728732877

Take in all kind of healthy diet and also include exercise in your lifestyle.	3.4122257362059143

Making a positive transformation in diet and lifestyle is the main means for prevention of heart diseases and cancer.	3.4948924805756407

Deficiencies of those nutrients in diet which are absent those can be removed by multivitamins.	3.391637857768388

Various kinds of elements can be found in multivitamins.	4.724718998859231

Only take supplements with good qualities.	5.25254345792714

On increase of age you do not get as much benefit as you get by starting it from before.	3.6956914770956346

If your food habits are wrong and you try to consummate it by taking multivitamins then it will not work.	3.0720985551123037

Multivitamins and minerals play the role of antioxidants very well.	4.265404873894295

If you are healthy and take in a healthy diet only then you can be a beneficiary of these supplements.	4.115701529767214

Not only this with increase in age when strength in your body to absorb various nutrients becomes weak even then there is utility of multivitamins.	2.9336665490750136

Despite this excess of vitamin tablets is harmful.	4.262264772511283

Therefore eat them only by consultation with a doctor.	4.597506293060336

In the disease of keratoconus shape of cornea changes slowly and in the end becomes crooked.	3.629249862804003

The newest treatment of keratoconus is C - 3 R.	4.097051766323823

The aim of this treatment is not only eyesight repair but is also stopping keratoconus providing strength to the weak part of cornea.	3.5166486697155883

With treatment of C - 3 growth in keratoconus stops.	4.188570379388228

After this treatment patient is also saved by cornea transplant.	4.156405938781623

There are other treatments of keratoconus other than C - 3 R - Cornea transplant and intakes but such a transplant can be successful only in very limited people.	2.1972883552145728

Often because of not getting proper sleep at night experience of freshness does not occur.	4.1645907051631905

One of its reasons is pain that occurs in feet.	4.351309399137229

Today we are telling you a remedy to remove this pain.	3.822294476048995

So that you may have a peaceful sleep at night.	4.394318162105881

Pain starts in legs also by sitting in one place for a long time.	3.806392240500105

It is called pins and needles parathesia.	4.2888212066264595

This problem arises because of blood not circulating in feet correctly.	3.990944500659318

If this problem persists then there may be a danger of occurrence of diabetes.	5.147058705673437

You move your legs only on occurrence of pain in legs at night which is called restless legs syndrome.	4.096170325104244

It is that state when on sitting or sleeping pain persist.	3.1384805516477874

For this change your lifestyle , sleep at the right time and do light exercise.	4.00522640821218

The strain that occurs in muscles of legs also happens to be quite distressing.	4.613704413614334

Not warming up before exercise , exercise in summer or thickening of muscles is responsible for it.	3.024670459423983

Do fomentation on occurrence of muscle cramp.	6.914266978341131

A new research of AIIMS has claimed that after donating kidney donor women remain happier as compared to such men.	2.9670739308995353

The Associate Professor of Department of Surgical Disciplines of AIIMS Sandeep Guleria has said that after donating kidney he wanted to do an assessment of level QOL of life of donor.	2.236769629285123

We found that after donating kidney a considerable improvement came in the QOL of donor.	3.026690324689254

Prof.Guleria said that out of these too more improvement came in QOL of women donors as compared to men donors , especially in the QOL of mothers and wives.	2.8583754676287376

Out of these many were married , many unmarried , some living in live - in relationships , some married but divorced or windowed.	2.1726926083001397

Since possibility of donation of kidney of mothers and wives is more hence we wanted to know that the reason of kidney donation of other women is love or they are compelled to do so.	2.605075440543077

Guleria has told that for doing so we did a survey with the medium of a questionnaire.	3.137627600219223

In which research of physical and mental health and social acceptance of donor was done.	3.3270899639911606

A total of 126 donors were included in this research in which 73 % were women.	3.749951819438904

They said that we asked them a lot of questions.	5.6399719463869085

Guleria has told that they were asked that after donating kidney are they enjoying their life , do they have enough money to fulfil their needs and are they completely satisfied with their personal and physical relationships.	2.073730305235561

The number of donor women is a lot but mothers and wives looked more satisfied after donating their kidney.	3.177638387451597

Fear of unbearable pain during menstruation has now started vanishing.	3.793040917147727

After hypnobirth , water birth , aroma therapy , reflexology and scientology methods of labor pain relief now trend of epidural anaesthesia is growing rapidly.	2.270759060826665

The reason for it is that where one gets some relief from pain in other methods there itself a mother stays 100 percent free from pain even in consciousness.	2.5525193708534086

Given benefits and demand of this technique not only is its experiment being used in all big hospitals but recently it has been started in AIIMS as well.	2.8951149972239447

Doctors have to say that despite awareness being less nowadays about 25 % women ask for such methods.	2.970493494042662

Senior gynaecologist Dr.Asha Sharma of Rockland Hospital says that the most important path of pain signal is the backbone.	2.9916374901453624

Anaesthetics stop this signal in the backbones even before it reaches the brain.	3.1511145145574355

In routine anaesthesia the injection is given directly in the spinal cord by which patient faints.	3.6076498815507123

But in epidural injection is applied in such a canal of the lower part of spinal cord that patient does get pain relief but her and the foetus both remain fully conscious and are also able to move hands feet.	2.5729745925656595

During the delivery anesthetic keep talking to the woman.	4.306180173125108

However during delivery woman is unable to apply pressure on the lower part.	6.189098620168653

Dr.Sharma says that if epidural anaesthesia is given at the right time with the help of an expert anesthetic then this method is completely safe.	3.5711083452573353

They start given anaesthesia when cervix has open 2 to 4 centimetres.	3.137132928871799

Former Head gynaecologist department of G.B.Pant Hospital Dr.Neera Agarwal says that this method is new for this place but it is being used in foreign countries for many years.	2.6003395479889515

This facility should start in all government hospitals because an expenditure of just till three thousand more occurs in it.	2.4013484534056726

But due to lack of resources related to anaesthesia and operation theater this is unable to start.	3.386865698215768

Dr.Agarwal says that there may be some risk in a condition of not getting the epidural anaesthesia in the right way at the right time.	3.9479276063563202

Meaning , blood pressure of woman reducing suddenly.By this heartbeat of foetus may slow down for a little while.	2.6762462414338333

In some people symptoms of acute headache , breathing problem , head reeling on getting up may also occur.	2.7406963262262853

In a condition of getting anaesthesia in the wrong canal the complete lower half of patient may get paralysed and there may be danger to the child in such a condition.	3.535304854103978

According to Dr.Agarwal body comes in complete control two to four hours after delivery and like normal delivery patient can also go home after a few hours.	2.7148758995307514

Homely women are not only learning to keep themselves fit by going to the gym but the atmosphere there is also giving them mental peace.	3.0397346244757624

Each one has become so busy in hasty life of today that he  she does not have time for himself  herself.	3.455823149121954

And such women who do service they definitely have shortage of time.	3.4006507438523887

Maybe it is the pressure of busyness itself that today a big change is appearing in metropolitan cities.	3.482491415135497

Among them homely women are also included in a large number.	4.23574338372084

This thing has been said for a long time that to run a family women staying fit is very important but there was no guideline about how they should stay fit.	2.768641621669009

But now this thing has emerged that during those days when winters are acute people may get depressed.	2.749831278567026

And depression thriving because of weather can remain until winters , it can not be removed by ordinary medicines.	3.3547251842332666

This very ' Seasonal Affective Disorder ' goes away on its own as soon as winters are over.	3.460476223506923

While winters get stronger various changes appear all around us.	3.4055888270561954

According to World Health Organisation the ratio of saturated fatty acid , unsaturated fatty acid that of monounsaturated fatty acid should be 1.5:1.	2.580233500854313

Experts have to say that bran oil proves to be true not on recommendation of W.H.O but also in comparison with other oils.	3.169296869047652

Snacks are liked in India for a long time not based on nutrition but on the basis of taste.	3.6867727815169897

For adequate mental and physical growth of children you should keep them away from junk food and processed food substances.	3.1224924456648058

Nutrition specialist Sangeeta Raj has to say that it is necessary to especially keep an eye on their food habits keeping in mind the growing interest of children in junk food and processed food on a daily basis.	2.8987686923937477

Often children in school or other places prefer burger , pizza , etc.	3.469208536517746

Although nowadays some private schools making a special menu for children send it to their parents and ask to send making tiffin according to it only.	2.1876695018258436

They have to say that from excessive consumption of junk food the mental and physical development of children may get affected because not only is there deficiency of nutritious food in those food substances but harmful fats and sugar in them are more calorific than necessary.	2.5464987391724505

Hence for good health of children they should be given food abundant in vitamins and nutritious substances.	4.711686830474244

Sushri Raj has to say that as such vitamins and nutritius substances should be an adequate amount in food of all people but normally it is not possible for everyone to do it.	3.0518448758344308

Normally what is deficient in food of children is Omega 3 fatty acid.	4.2739231884845035

This fatty acid is necessary for nervous system and brain of children.	5.187371664065404

During long study time of children the significance of this acid increases a lot.	3.3517478292066345

Hence for this acid children should be given pumpkin seeds , fish , flax oil and seeded fruits.	3.3580489415507686

Its quantity is more in these fruits and they are normally easily available in every season.	4.558670057838687

They have to say that the children who do not like to eat fruits.	5.599215012773286

They are unable to get vitamin ' C ' in ample amount.	4.66466624600703

Vitamin ' C ' along with increasing disease resistance capacity helps in connecting tissues inside skin.	3.0371270788679356

Claiming a ray of hope for patients suffering from heart attack scientists have said that they have found out such a specific ' special trigger ' in a variety of cholesterol which becomes the main cause of heart rekated diseases and whose production does not get affected by food habits.	2.800153974352021

According to ' New England Journal of Medicine ' scientists have detected lipo protein A which deposit a lyer in arteries.	2.189911506531532

This discovery has proved the old fear of therapists to be true and it means that patients can be treated with medicines like aspirin.	2.874919499379949

With the help of this discovery a decrease in the numner of those patients will occur who are suffering from heart related diseases.	3.168280050916391

In this age of science and technology also today malnutrition and are leaving their effects , but the fight against malnutrition is continuing by researchers and doctors.	2.077840678486957

Complete it.	7.174776245932901

The main reason of malnutrition is the lack of strength , which is obtained from energy filled meals.	3.5083574921235408

In this kind of meal food , protein , minerals etc are found in proper amounts.	4.292589484193176

These elements are found in balanced amounts in Spirulina.	5.510454184841038

Along with supplying the balanced food Spirulina also does the diagnosis of many diseases.	3.460423103350662

The most important protein in Spirulina is , which is found till 65 - 70 percent , whereas protein in such quantity is not found in any other plant.	2.8457941428732503

Out of ten amino acids important for the body eight are found in Spirulina and because of its protein being soluble in water approximately 85 percent gets absorbed in the body.	3.099321810617551

Vitamin Calcium , magnesium , potassium , sodium and phosphate are found in Spirulina , which give it the status of a complete food.	3.2819013546709965

Its first use was done for malnourished children and infected women , which was successful.	2.988924798161687

During this time this came to be known that Spirulina is also helpful in the diagnosis of other diseases.	3.5070912260484364

The researchers worldwide proved this that Spirulina is also effective in pancreas related , thyroid , hepatitis , cholesterol , diabetes , arthritis and night blindness.	2.392326848554629

In the Africa continent Spirulina has been proven successful in fighting with malnutrition of children in plentiful.	2.853072483510089

It has also been found useful in cancer and HIV prevention.	4.123207432506348

The youth must not remain in this that only aging people can get heart attacks.	3.5501959362207423

Statistics and research done by experts show that among people coming in the grip of heart attack now the number of youth less than 40 years is increasing rapidly.	3.4818942748864687

Saif Ali Khan had to be admitted to the hospital some time back owing to a problem related to heart , then the severe heart attack of fashion designer Rohit Bal.	2.5136226551190886

The signal is clear that the youth is rapidly moving towards heart related problems.	3.3075279321150814

A big reason for this is their bad lifestyle.	4.7974351385745555

A study done by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS is enough to shock.	3.166857764605121

The study shows that the rate high blood pressure , obesity and heart related diseases in the youth is increasing rapidly.	4.042232530762575

Especially the youth living in the cities are coming fast in its grip.	3.7130567129141605

According to doctors the fast lifestyle of the youth living in cities , fatty food and the increasing use of alcohol is responsible for this because of which the matter of obesity , high blood pressure and diabetes is increasing among the youth.	3.312899076241122

Research shows that in such cases the condition of the metropolitan youth is alarming.	4.205211989628681

Complete it.	7.174776245932901

According to the study of the World Health Organization the most heart patients in the country are in Delhi after Kerala.	3.323884901330545

In these people of middle class are more.	4.949120745026789

Till ten - twelve years before people used to think this that the problem of heart disease i.e.blockage in the arteries of the heart is less in India in comparison to the whole world.	4.012961281033793

But in various studies and researches this is known that in comparison to the Western countries 2 - 3 percent of people in India are afflicted with heart disease.	3.5799489163325715

Without doubt this is a matter of grave importance.	5.172284970950898

Before where the possibility of heart disease between 30 to 40 years of age was sketched , today this possibility has reduced and is found in people of 20 years of age and less.	3.974738857585173

The heart diseases which happen to people in America at the age of 40 - 50 , they begin among the people here 10 years before.	3.14050878733755

There are many reasons of this.	5.729995254629139

Today , in the country in less than 40 years of age the problem of heart disease is increasing rapidly.	5.091335885624827

This rate is seen increasing rapidly towards youth of 20 years.	3.5153564021185355

It is obvious the biggest reason of this is only and only the fast changing lifestyle.	4.112241643559255

In reality the rate of coronary heart related disease in Indians especially in the youth , has begun to be found to be almost three times more in comparison to western countries.	3.1827158153904564

Today the craze of smoking can be seen to be in many of the youth.	4.390628651351948

In the form of a base the bad effects of smoking have been recorded not only in India but on the international level also.	3.215387409168919

According to the WHO nearly 1.1.billion people in the world smoke , in which one third are of the age of 16.	3.7790125799004066

Dr.Trehan says in the matter of the ill effects of smoking , professional people smoke because they feel that by this their tension will dissipate , but they ignore that fact , by which has come forward that this gives a bad effect on their health.	2.4260875085664213

There are harmful things like nicotine and tar in cigarettes and carbon monoxide is enough for destroying the heart.	2.558892297365541

Normally in our country fried food is consumed in which cholesterol and carbohydrates are more.	3.492746511268571

In things like pakora , jalebi , samosa these elements are found more.	3.7295357561950016

Actually our food habits are proheart disease.	5.552582194951079

Low Density Cholesterol meaning LDC is also the result of deteriorating habits of food.	3.648743481020639

Because of these habits only the cholesterol deposited in the veins start making them narrow.	3.0134289700979853

As a result , by this the supply of blood received by the heart gets affected and the possibilities of heart attack take hold.	3.4914893160435296

It is not difficult to control the increasing heart diseases on the youth and children.	3.2987551581739414

Only some things need to be kept in mind.	5.613785028908775

Everyday for 45 minutes do a brisk walk i.e.walk fast.	3.19509633034726

Keep a control on the diet.	8.161965717700278

Use such an oil in food which does not solidify.	5.046248552569547

There comes a restriction in the flow of blood by it solidifying in the veins.	3.697096362824756

There is less cholesterol in olive oil or saffola.	4.468537937191106

One can see the physical exertion getting less in city people.	3.2583579160790075

Most people go in cars.	6.855591282012979

Lifts are provided in buildings.	6.926841843844002

Walking on foot is almost not present.	5.110162177089503

They see it in the form of gas production or some other problem , but for knowing this that there is no problem coming , this can be understood in three forms.	3.7438564103778007

In step - 1 the beginning of the heart disease has started , but the patient has not known.	5.519648053559647

There was no harm to the patient also.	8.919845655956614

In step - 2 there is some chagrin while doing some work , anger comes or feel some pressure or burning on the chest on running , then it can be Angina.	2.8959621259775283

When you feel such symptoms then get warned and get a check up done immediately.	3.2427047888286222

Step - 3 is the most dangerous and comes forward in the form of heart attack.	5.878330299055924

In this the patient does not only know that there was the reason of Angina or on knowing also he had ignored it.	3.5903493834746825

In such cases the danger of heart attacks increases 20 percent in which the life of the person may be lost.	4.901830139188112

In these 10 percent of the matters are not able to reach the hospital even.	5.0043723297201

That is why one must remain very careful.	4.335174810007227

No symptom of enzyma appears in the patients of diabetes.	5.27464262215093

No warning is received from the side of the body.	4.944021785308082

Their nerves become numb because of diabetes.	5.002977252593311

Such people must always get their check up done.	4.2182415444023285

In such youth whose parents have had problems of the heart in them the possibility of these problems emerging in small age can remain.	3.7002112874098088

Meaning if its fear has been expressed on medical basis after the age of 30 then such people may have this problem in the age of 20 also.	3.5995949352539376

If one person has problems like cholesterol , blood pressure and diabetes then he comes in the high risk category.	3.536890697719257

It is dangerous to have good cholesterol less than 50 and bad cholesterol more than 100.	3.3155760154435128

Such people who smoke cigarettes more then become more careful.	4.036909166650021

Because of thickness coming in the blood also due to clots depositing problems increase in the heart.	4.61455901023514

Because of deteriorated lifestyle people become stressed and for getting instant relief from tension take the support of smoking and alcohol.	2.718191127017674

After the blood pressure getting haywire gradually heart related diseases take birth and one does not get to know.	3.945716899976662

In depression the person feels like eating again and again because of which excess fat starts depositing in the body and the danger of heart attack increases.	4.068478807628778

These people who are habituated to eating western food and drinks they should get their check up done because there is more sugar and salt in western food , by which flab increases.	3.3092432971169954

After menopause the danger of heart attack emerges , because the veins of the heart remain fit because of the estrogens hormones secreted by the ovaries , that is why women have more danger after the age of 50.	3.3582545111667566

Therefore after the age of 50 get regular check ups done.	5.500055994400012

Specialists related with the diseases of the heart say that along with keeping the food habits better one should get the habit of regular exercise.	4.476794092841609

TMT Tread Mill Test : - When enough is not understood about coronary heart disease by ECG then TMT test is done.	2.5394360795835826

Eco cardiogram : - For measuring the speed of the beats of the heart this check is done.	3.7156565314995897

In these two other types of tests are also done.	4.025441714376568

Transesophageal echocardiogram TEE : - In this test the pipe going from the neck to the stomach is tested because this pipe passes close to the heart.	3.078826972617781

This check is done on the coming of the need of any surgical treatment.	4.510330455058973

Stress Ecocardiogram : - By this test heart wall and its pumping work is seen.	2.9602039851100486

This test is done immediately before and after exercise.	5.090217936975969

Angiography : - By the medium of this test the percentage of blockage is found.	4.680686331280441

Doctors have to say that there is some risk in this test and it is a little more expensive also.	5.417230334889889

The people for whom the situation of angioplasty or bypass surgery arises , they are asked to do this test frequently.	2.931454422918731

There is a check for this also.	4.930883858956109

In this order there is another test which is called homocysteine test.	3.9147049454166303

Its level must be from 0 to 5.	5.791027650255125

In this only there is a test LPA.	7.044275670100881

In these tablets of nicotine are given.	4.784225244212998

Apart from this the doctor also does the check of sugar level , BP etc.	3.2822787750550466

According to doctors there is a direct relation of the rise and fall of sugar and blood pressure with diseases.	4.0719177923760785

Many fears remain in the mind about the bypass surgery used in the treatment of heart diseases.	4.170125830763135

What is this after all ? 	7.504724513708095

According to doctors heart fails due to the disfunctioning of the heart valve , blood pressure increase , increase of muscles of the heart and by weakening of the heart.	3.9988427192963014

If there is treatment on time then one can be saved.	5.327268691592123

The blockage in the vein of the heart coronary artery is called coronary artery disease CAD.	3.690703844763049

This blockage is due to the deposition of fat , by which the vein becomes hard.	4.4127340163677875

رگو ں کے پوری طرح بند ہونے میں دل کا دورہ پڑنے کا خطرہ بڑھ جاتا ہے۔ 	12.670329882248849

Of the three major veins of the heart barriers can be formed in any one or all.	3.7657099236054368

In such situation in the operation a vein is taken out from any part of the body and connected to the vein of the heart.	3.8280396641733057

This newly connected nerve starts blood flow automatically in the vein.	3.326613068084593

Many people feel that sick veins are taken out and new veins are attached , that is a wrong belief.	2.9742420510026615

Sick veins are not taken out instead in that vein a new vein is attached in front of the block or restriction , the blood flow remains intact itself by this.	2.5695967753770326

In the matter of artery blockage bypass surgery is the best option.	4.534430696784759

Initially bypass surgery was done by stopping the heartbeats.	4.571829945235376

By this there used to be an effect on other parts kidney , liver , lungs etc.	3.8410863617701265

Now with new method beating heart surgery only that place of the heart is stopped where surgery has to happen.	3.6247068349682605

In the previous method seven - eight bottles of blood was required in the surgery of the heart , whereas in beating heart surgery one to two bottles of blood is enough.	3.1328079106888698

The patient also gets discharged from the hospital in seven days.	3.8524799495595055

In the new techniques of bypass surgery beating heart surgery is successful.	3.436130383956536

By this the patients have less difficulty , and they get discharged from the hospital in seven days.	3.191510525928186

Friends , for achieving success it is very essential to wake early morning.	4.282358243332504

Along with the body the mind also becomes pleasant.	6.057032219550843

By getting up early you will be able to see these sights.	4.757773273067204

Eating according to necessity does not mean this that one thing should be eaten more.	4.110479556160768

There is no one food which can fulfil the needs of your body or your strength.	3.4706522509653728

That is why there is necessity of variance in your food.	3.3805469220940614

Eating that same one type of food all the time we limit the nutritious elements in our diet.	3.752912707424294

So for balanced diet we should choose some foods from the main food groups everyday.	2.8690773752852325

Grains like rice , roti , doubleroti etc they give strength for play and work.	2.897832519375499

Pulses and milk give us protein and help us in growing.	3.3767109898494914

Fruits and vegetables give us vitamin , minerals and fibers.	3.750579175674966

Apart from fruits and vegetables we get fiber from grains like wheat , oatmeal etc.	3.1378520812232584

We get help in digesting properly by fibers.	5.348116724065388

For staying healthy and for growing properly fats like ghee is important.	3.177450568822627

But by too much fat in the diet obesity , heart attacks and some types of cancer can also happen.	3.6162620937788046

That is why eat things fried in oil processed cheese paneer , butter , cream , ice cream and chocolate etc least.	2.4093761345943796

By eating too many sweets harm can befall your teeth and decay too.	3.2035479077629976

This makes you fat and lazy.	5.668084487407071

This is true that for growing and for working you need strength.	3.3342258555896223

For this if you eat roti , rice , potato , yam etc and do a little abstinence from white sugar , jaggery , sugar , then it will be better.	2.9119015945581332

After eating it is good to take less sweet things and les or absolutely no sugar in milk , tea or coffee.	2.8813257809405584

Juice of fruits are much better than soft drinks like cola.	3.5858698353118044

Steam pressure , baking or cooking by roasting , is better than boiling because by this beneficial substances can be saved in the food.	3.057981144830418

For working and taking the enjoyment of life there should be strength in the body.	3.5183650850510557

The body gets this energy by eating.	4.874451669286389

Calorie , energy of eating If we eat more than the necessity of our body then it will deposit on our body as fat.	4.126561303813363

After working , reading , exercise , illness for reaching the previous condition and growing , along with fuel there is also the necessity of nutrition.	2.877305963225953

It is best for the health not to smoke.	5.352407628292375

There are more than 400 harmful and toxic chemical substances in the smoke of tobacco like nicotine , tar , carbon monoxide etc.	2.8050363413272046

Cigarette , bidi , hukka , chilum , pipe are also harmful.	4.003214206534551

Similar to cocaine , heroin and other addictive substances , there is nicotine poison in tobacco , which is an addictive thing.	2.788676402817178

On the addiction of nicotine coming once man starts being dependent on it and can not leave its habit easily.	2.7781670933481193

That is why people who are smokers have difficulty in leaving smoking.	3.581145373287342

The smoke of tobacco harms your body and cancer of lungs , throat etc , heart disease and are the reason of lung diseases of long duration like bronchitis , asthma etc.	3.019727745416079

By this tolerance power is also lost.	5.027794672263633

By this infertility can also occur.	6.045511754985821

If you want to remain active and fit then say ' no ' to smoking.	2.859169039297552

Do not be influenced by your friends or by advertisements of cigarettes.	3.063878381607805

Do not let the eagerness of smoking dominate over yourself.	3.410706843555261

A smoker also has a bad effect on people near him.	4.120824194951433

Burning cigarette or bidi throws smoke outside in the air then it increases the amount of smoke in the air.	3.454014174199758

The people sitting in that room also take this smoke in their lungs.	3.28460913697224

They become ' passive smokers '.	8.881488583444277

The meaning of it is this that other people who are not smoking also , even then the harmful effect of cigarette happens on their lungs and heart.	3.125856278474159

This way the person who smokes causes harm to the members of his family , friends and people near him.	3.229256687937455

Out of 1000 500 young people who smoke will in the end , die from diseases happening due to tobacco.	3.113837735448159

Out of 1000 young people who smoke 250 will die in middle age only.	3.2203617425074165

Normally in comparison to non smokers they reduce 22 years of their life.	4.281952707766592

250 smokers will die in old age but they will have remained sick with diseases happening due to tobacco.	3.0214967239451336

If smokers can make up their minds , they can leave it.	3.248451016112469

For this there is the necessity of mental strength and determination.	4.883661947613672

For making cigarette many trees are cut every year wood is burnt for preparing tobacco.	2.508760203841056

Someone has cut a tree somewhere behind every three hundred cigarettes.	3.196776129751089

You are yourself responsible for your health.	4.624767771535142

Those people who inspire you to smoke , do not listen to them.	2.9783976848302762

For doing weight loss people start staying hungry and the effect of this is seen clearly on their health.	3.598043618931834

In reality when we reduce eating then its meaning is this that we stop giving the body such necessary elements , which is essential for a healthy body.	2.8699530680304934

That is why whenever you think of reducing weight , keep this thing in mind that there should not be a lack of nutritious elements in the body.	3.557115096987708

Always take proper and healthy diet.	5.868477829743946

In some people there are weight and health problems on becoming adults , because they diet and take unhealthy weight loss diet for weight loss in childhood.	2.438891691013451

For decreasing weight the permission for dieting is not given till then , till there is not complete physical development and this condition comes by the age of 18.	2.8199028456616175

If you are less than 18 years and are overweight then consult your doctor or dietician.	2.9255680576667853

They will tell you such a healthy diet plan by which along with good health weight will not increase.	3.107552933085342

For this talk to your parents also.	3.875919598385551

It has been found that in 90 percent of those who diet in the age of 12 - 17 have had lack of ' bone mass ' on becoming adults.	3.227847619499031

That is why from childhood you should definitely take the requirements of your body like calcium , vitamin D or vitamin C and all other nutritious elements which are important for bone growth.	2.786989124186555

Dieting also becomes the reason for the deficiency of folic acid and iron in the body.	4.386611697626095

These two save from nutritients anemia.	5.282763292656478

Because of staying busy in school , sports and other activities in that age you should refrain from the ' ill - effects ' of anemia.	2.4226943310667997

Strict dieting can never keep your health and diet alright.	3.5956043910599096

Give preference to healthy food and daily exercise.	4.506271576374885

This helps in keeping the weight controlled along with your health.	4.385935786991643

The meaning of healthy food is not this that you stay away from high calorie foods like ice cream , toffee , popcorn , cheese burger etc.	2.7551478710026314

You eat these and foods similar to these but in small quantities and sometimes.	3.2777938692016546

As beautiful as a strawberry looks it is as much filled with benefits.	3.285897734323762

Like other berries high amounts of anti oxidants especially anticyanine type - 2 and ellagitannins are found in strawberries.	3.0945645922046086

Because of these pigments the color of the strawberries is red.	4.22773965330989

Researches have proved this that anthocyanins like antioxidant lessens the diseases related to cancer , cardiovascular disease and inflammation.	2.9000786691402234

As such strawberry is a foreign fruit and it is considered the favorite fruit of Europe.	3.4101617923272047

But now it is favored a lot in India also.	5.293629184607149

Because of this reason only in some mountainous areas of India the farming of strawberries has started being done.	2.6864373175542733

The main reason for the increasing fascination towards this fruit are the medicinal properties found in this.	3.2472695053061513

In this there is already an abundance of potassium , iron , calcium and vitamin A and C because of the capability of not letting cholesterol build in the body this fruit is especially miraculous for heart patients also.	3.327139395941991

Apart from eating it raw in the form of a fruit it is used in squash , jam and many other foods for strawberry test.	3.2025611648730377

In the plant of strawberry which grows to four inches the fruits grow in the form of bunches , which become of a deep red color on ripening.	2.5294739139188374

These fruits can be kept safe at the most for two days only.	3.8535914030909026

Not only this , on keeping in the freezer also black spots appear on them.	3.119532935074293

That is why for preserving its qualities they should be kept in the open and should be consumed as soon as possible.	3.5213379137110183

Take fruits in the form of snacks.	7.449677217954223

Keep some walnuts in them for extra crunch.	4.8884319479603615

Eat light sweets also.	9.025184352704356

The dinner of your choice : - The most easy way of taking a healthy meal is that you decide that you will take half plate of vegetables and on the other half proteins meat , eggs , beans and carbohydrates rice , roti , paratha , pasta , potato , noodles in equal portions.	2.4325886487970654

If you want to eat pizza then give preference to cheese and pepperoni in light pizza and vegetables and fruit pizza in heavy pizzas.	2.313955465958315

If some child is more fat with relation to his age or body mass density BMI or if the amount of body fat in the body is found to be more then he is overweight or a victim of obesity.	3.446759396136484

Especially if a child of 3 - 4 years or some child is afflicted with obesity then by this a bad or negative effect falls on his health.	3.141938570421831

Physician doctor K.K.Agarwal in Moolchand hospital says , those children who are excessively fat , there are two main reasons for that - first genetic in which is present the genetic factor and the other life style in which is present lifestyle , food habits , environment factors etc.	2.3546571769705578

In genetic factors if the parents or some family member is fat then the child may also be fat.	3.475088592066384

If the mother - father both are fat then there remains 80 percent possibility of the child being fat and 40 percent when some one from mother - father is fat.	3.0157109739081718

In today 's fast life the busyness of elders has increased so much that they have started showing negligence towards the food habits of children along with themselves.	2.7452221350108914

Now fast food full of high calories has taken the place of healthy food.	4.334798204281093

According to Dr.K.K.Agarwal , today in place of nutritious salad and fruits children give attention to pizza and burger whose result is coming forward in the form of excess fatness.	2.6490138990671905

Being almost not involved in physical activities , giving attention to hours of virtual gaming , electronic games , video games and watching TV etc increases the calories which is the main reason for weight increase.	2.5248986042192967

Digestive related problems are also common in fat children like the complaint of indigestion , constipation etc always remains.	3.340051478011312

Obesity in childhood becomes a condition of chronic medical condition.	4.398308587402152

Those people who are afflicted with obesity from childhood in them the danger of chronic disease is more than those who smoke , drink a lot.	3.788724427120651

Excess fatness in small age also becomes the reason for infertility on growing older.	3.6454858153312335

By this because of sleep and eating disorders like anorexia nervosa , shorter life span , high cholestrol , high blood pressure , lack of stamina and overweight body mass the complaints of pain in joints and bones etc can be seen.	2.7990002044615685

Today obesity in children throughout the world is going on increasing in an alarming way.	3.731292236496556

Physical inactivity , a diet full of fats and calories and genetics pushes children towards obesity to a large extent.	2.3769153861058707

Through a strict and balanced diet obesity can be brought in control.	3.660019595324427

Especially parents should also make use of balanced diet only then their kids will not be genetically influenced.	3.8406772308975494

Along with that it is very important to exercise daily , encourage children towards physical activity , stop them from watching TV for more than 2 hours , and give them nutritious diet instead of junk food.	2.7287004924728664

Treatment is also a way for obese children.	6.525968928207701

Like stomach bypass surgery and liposuction prove very effective in this.	3.712131515554811

Originally this is a vegetable of America.	6.9285139567652285

In reality its farming is happening for thousands of years in tropical America.	3.123693681598472

Its farming is done in our country also and it is used in the form of a major vegetable.	5.438343560390699

Its use is done in the form of a medicine and hotness in vegetables.	4.539386695902092

Apart from its unique taste and fragrance a high level of nutrition is found in capsicum.	3.701781311254728

Many types of proteins and fats are also found in this.	4.60418056362645

Vitamin A and C and provitamin E , P , B 1 , B 2 and B 3 etc are also found in this colorful vegetable.	3.490548176356021

Its mucous membrane is beneficial for eyes and skin.	5.745192396841499

This also saves from infection.	7.91240819607147

By helping in reducing blood pressure this promotes cardiovascular health.	3.335145232353542

It makes the basic elements of tissue and cell damage ineffective by the antioxidant properties.	2.6563603597307264

This helps in reducing cholesterol as a result of which the possibility of stroke and heart attack becomes less.	4.289190701051935

By increasing the speed of metabolism this burns more and more calories.	4.36097864506487

This also works in the treatment of cold and fever.	6.902411013634163

For patients of diabetes capsicum is helpful.	6.767303699574982

Meat is not the natural diet of man.	5.907194459253658

Those people who eat meat , uric acid is produced in more quantity in their blood.	3.944754325391905

This uric acid gives birth to blood disorders , heart disease , tuberculosis , insomnia , hypertension , liver disease etc apart from arthritis and urinary disorders.	2.4833218948849436

The fat present in meat and the excess amount of cholesterol gets deposited in the internal vessels of the blood vessels of the body of a carnivorous person and makes them narrow by which a restriction is generated in the blood flow.	3.2601101282451475

The fat present in the fat and ghee obtained from animals , butter , meat , fish , eggs increases the amount of cholesterol in the blood with rapidity , by which the situation of high blood pressure starts developing.	3.677123170761822

So much so that by paralysis and the restriction in the blood of the heart by bleeding in the brain heart stroke and heart attack can also happen.	3.7025017022318214

If a person decreases the amount of cholesterol in the diet then he can escape from the disease of the gall bladder.	4.795975630713816

Healthy kidneys of a person can do emissions of uric acid in the quantity of seven grain everyday only.	3.8765893102577973

But enough pressure falls on the kidneys on more amount of uric acid by a carnivorous by which stones start forming in them or swelling starts happening in its cells.	2.6141584896290273

If this situation remains for a long time then the kidneys stop working.	3.910152445643793

In reality meat is not the food of man.	5.603016232122333

The organization of his body , teeth and food pipe also does not have any similarity to the composition of the intestines of carnivorous animals.	3.370489465715818

Like carnivorous animals the length of the small and big intestines of man is more than even four times the length of his body.	3.729662814149035

Along with this , for meat many times the murder of such animals is also done which are sick.	3.081555617453642

If you do not consider that you look ' dashing ' by a cigarette attached to your lips then change your thinking , because it has been asserted in a new study that the IQ of a person decreases by smoking.	2.650433097829385

The Intelligence Quotient scale of intelligence measure of a person is less in comparison to a person who smokes cigarette.	4.2418071955696846

It was found in a study that smoking has to do with the IQ of a person.	3.316907451717653

According to a published study in addiction journal , the average IQ of persons who do not smoke remained 101 whereas smoking persons remained seven points less 93.	2.4004361384468056

The IQ of youth smoking more than one packet in one day remained nearly 90.	3.5214987301438323

Does sexual activity decrease with the increasing age , this question has been the topic of debate for a long time but it has been said in a report published in the British Medical Journal recently that its strings are attached to healthy life , especially in males.	2.6315856214404114

In old age in comparison to women men remain sexually active more than twice.	3.7137772956667954

This matter came forward in the studies of the researchers of the University of Chicago.	3.6825761126487184

It has been said in the studies , ' Men and women of very good health , are more active in comparison to men and women of average or bad health '.	3.141858339192278

It has been said in this that men and women of good health can show 1.5 to 1.8 times more interest in sex in comparison to men and women of bad health.	3.3475387155895358

Associate professor Stacey Teslar and research associate Natalia Gavrilova has produced this conclusion on the studying of more than six thousand data of 25 to 85 years.	2.392573372520032

For men the sexual activity time is more long , but because of bad health in comparison to women men lose more years of sexual activity.	3.001578107477399

In the published report this was also found that those people who remain more sex - active , there is more hope of their being more healthy.	3.062204249260882

In this it is said that , ' In men among people active in a sexual way good health is linked to this sex specially.	2.706678124694472

It was also found in the report that similar healthy sexual relations , are not the same in men and women.	3.4489737462808336

For instance , at the age of 55 in men of very good or grand health in comparison to men of bad health an increase of 5 -7 years ordinarily happens in sexually active life.	2.849000302130474

This thing is not applicable on women.	5.295478371102045

In women with very good or grand health in comparison to women with bad health there is ordinarily an increase of 3 - 6 years in the sexually active life.	2.6216724926603088

It was found in a study that sexual activity , sex life of high quality and interest in sex is more in men compared to women and this keeps increasing with age gaps.	2.935552460777425

They said the brain of men first hears the music and its lyrics together , and then during a complex process understands the lyrics.	2.5626935235676815

After this the brain starts behaving differently with both.	3.794900602414188

They got to know from the MRI of a music listening person that when the active part of the brain gives attention to the music and when it gives attention to the lyrics of the song.	2.8974649910802284

Scientists got to know that neurons process again and again with one then with time their response starts decreasing.	3.1146822015441162

They accepted that when they decrease and increase only the voice and keep the rhythm there then the areas showing less activity must certainly be working on the lyrics of the song.	2.2732622895288066

They prepared four sets of six different songs which volunteers were made to listen.	2.6302637899059214

During this scanning of their brain was done.	3.9823238012980027

After this test the top scientist connected with the team Daniela Sammler said , the brain initially takes music and its lyrics together.	2.5745928965350644

After this the brain goes through a complex process and understands the lyrics.	2.9950445421908194

After understanding the lyrics the brain starts behaving differently with both.	3.1512940651675345

The thyroid gland can become a danger for your young age.	4.368864354826046

Yes , it has been claimed in a new study thyroid increases the danger of a heart attack in young people till quite an extent.	3.620868464679887

According to the Stroke Journal of the American Heart Association researchers have found in their study that if thyroid is more than usually active in young people then it increases the danger of a heart attack in them up to 44 percent.	2.908060173711083

Researchers did this comparison with those people in whom this gland remains constant.	3.8823681458262844

The main author in the journal and Professor Hernag - Ching Linn in the Taipei Medical University of Taiwan was quoted as saying ' Our study shows the relation between Hyperthoidism and heart attack '.	1.8998542686240572

The attacks about which we can not find out they are between one third to one fourth of the heart attacks which come in young age.	3.186381684495558

Linn said in our knowledge hyperthyroidism has never been seen ever as a big danger in the heart attacks happening between 18 to 44 years of age.	2.6462856141608344

It is interesting that the more than necessary remaining active of the thyroid gland is called ' hyperthyroidism '.	3.647305944320838

This is a common problem which shows its effect in 0.5 percent one in every 200 to 2 percent one in every 50 people in the population of the whole world.	3.2264285943698887

In the Lavanya Ayurvedic Cancer Hospital and Research Centre the treatment of cancer is possible from the root by ayurvedic medicine.	3.3595046889415245

There have been innumerable successful uses of finishing the cancer disease from the root.	2.9497663238677116

Thousands of patients have got life profit.	4.907594591369886

Because cancer is a distortion occurring at the level of D.N.A.of cells and ayurveda medicine is successful in making the distortion at the D.N.A.level of the cell alright.	2.7382745833976068

In the Lavanya Ayurvedic hospital there has been the successful treatment of many cancer patients of the country and abroad.	3.5813670086806497

Cancer happens because of the increase on an arbitrary basis in the cells of the body.	4.749849306297449

When this increase takes the form of a wound and does not heal for a long time then its checking is done through CT scan ultrasound.	3.592011945483322

If this growth is found to be increased then through F.C.or biopsy the checking of the samples extracted from this is done so that the confirmation of this matter is done that it is cancer or not and if it is then in what state.	2.653801318509914

After this check surgery radiotherapy , chemotherapy and sometimes by giving hormonal supplements the attempt of a cure can be done.	2.607667026312961

Along with this on doing operation as soon as scissors run on the cancer cells its unchecked growth becomes even faster and again the support of radiation and chemotherapy is taken.	2.502243619842766

Radiation occurs through X - ray or Cobalt - ray by which along with cancerous cells many healthy cells also get destroyed.	2.6287797761553655

By exposure to radiation for a long time the body can not get over and the dangerous side effect is this that the cells battered by radiation come under the grip of cancer the fastest.	3.000704120425131

This way there is a basis of chemotherapy is to destroy the chemical substances of the cancerous cells so that their unrestricted growth can be checked.	3.0986828458306706

But because the chemical substance can not recognize that which cells are cancer affected and which are healthy cells without cancer.	2.765557793472676

That destroys everything outright by which healthy cells also get influenced and become incapable.	2.948891073722384

When the capability of cells in the body finishes then the spread of cancer from one place to the other or activity of the metastasis increases.	3.5157487580632565

The other ill effects of chemotherapy are very bad like the fattening of the skin of the body , the digestive activity going bad , not feeling hungry , mouth remaining continuously dry , loss of hair and the fattening of the nerves because of which while giving drip one has to face difficulty in piercing injection.	2.9398688244886126

There are many ill effects of the medicine given by hormonal supplements.	4.48455608702478

This way we see that with these three types of medicines the patient gets respite for a few days , but for correcting the distortion come on the D.N.A.level of the cell one has to understand the Tridosh theory Vata , Pitta and Kapha by which the conduct of the whole body happens.	2.885218131443555

We can understand this by the example of an engine of a car.	3.290011827276211

The engine runs by the birth of pressure of compressor the vata dosh of Ayurveda as if does the work of the compressor for the engine styled body.	2.532965079532465

If the compressor becomes more than usually active then there can be an explosion in the engine.	3.5348803887219002

If the compressor is less then the engine does not take pick up.	3.8744499768908396

Along with the compressor being made the temperature of the engine also increases.	3.7878829108103877

The role of the gall in the engine styled body is like temperature.	3.853374812295241

If the temperature of the engine increases more than necessary then the engine gets and if this becomes less than necessity then the engine does not start only.	3.1028604779700566

Now if you are making the temperature of the engine favourable and there is not enough friction in the internal parts of it then the use of lubricants is necessary.	3.9071660145046083

This way if there is no friction in the parts of the body and the temperature remains favourable then it is essential for a kind of viscosity to remain made.	4.177593238172183

This work is of kafa in the body.	4.5884137562635186

If the lubricant is less then the engine and if it is more then the engine misfires , exactly like this the condition of the engine styled body , the happens due to the lack of kafa happening more.	3.308901134168138

After understanding the Tridosh theory now we look at the metabolism happening continuously in the body.	3.019027539525132

Whatever we eat , drink , goes in our stomach and by this activity begins in the.	3.464522807714883

The nutritious element of the food from the intestine changes into blood , meat , fat , bone , semen and energy respectively this is called dhatu in Ayurveda.	2.7005496887756326

In the activity of their making there is some remaining part which is shit.	3.832699015338462

It is not enough for the nutritional elements to reach the body only how they turn into dhatu and shit with the help of , this is an important issue of life and health.	3.0830302558266545

This can also be understood with the help of an example.	6.309508826619338

There is a fire ignited in the fire pit and samidha is being poured from the top.	2.704275501546272

If the fire is being lighted in the correct manner then the samidha will take the form of ash , but if we went on putting more samidha in the fire than its capacity or if we put more wood in the fire then then fire will get dim , then the samidha will not become ash but start turning into coal.	2.0951054094669934

Exactly like this more food taken in than the capacity of hunger remains indigested , then stool become abnormal or underdone and becomes what is called aam which begins the activity of spreading rot.	2.2903644811909087

Then instead of the food being prepared with full energy begins turning into ' dhuan ' or gas.	3.037675275461379

Nutritional elements are reached by blood vessels in every cell situated in the body.	3.483961614385142

Where the activity of catabolism takes place by the fire of the cells.	4.316474209478922

When this falls low then nutritional elements are not digested properly.	3.1307495592638386

They stay stuck in the cells , can not come out in the form of shit.	5.951418701579512

Such unrecognizable cells are known by the name of free radical cells in modern medicine and the activity of catabolism is known by the name of deoxidation.	2.9834830808627064

The first starting of cancer building is considered from here only.	3.2151800444948138

If we sketch this condition of the unrecognizable cells on the criterion of the theory of the afore mentioned Tridosh of Ayurveda then we can say this that there can be three reasons for this condition of the cells - Vata , Pitta and Kafa.	2.651804060788182

If the Kafa i.e.lubricant or viscosity increases then it will narrow or choke the hole of the cells because of which the waste of the cells will not be able to come out.	3.219363345421494

If Pitta increases then because of the temperature increasing their size increases due to the ionic change in the outside walls of the cells.	4.112739260255473

And the holes become choked.	6.71965836023819

This way if the Vata increases then it squeezes the cell from the outside.	2.8498229752223114

By this also the holes of the cell get blocked.	4.788210971126948

We saw that on the increase of all three Kafa Pitta and Vata the result came out as the same that the holes of the cell closed.	2.8076055393032786

According to Ayurveda it is important to know for the increase of which dosha in the three especially has the disease occurred.	3.384178913407105

The diagnosis of Ayurveda is not only the result but also to understand the circumstance of the of dosha the patient.	3.320001283801531

Although in modern medicine in view of the result the medicine is given but that medicine may be increasing the Pitta and the cells have closed because of the increase in Pitta , by this instead of benefits the possibility of harm increases.	2.803323492195756

In Allopathic medicine there is no way of knowing this that the holes in the cells occurred due to the which special reason of the three , the treatment starts without knowing the actual reason then the imbalance between the three dosha of the body becomes even more.	3.3141013742261167

As a result the condition of the cells begins to worsen more , it moves more towards being incurable.	3.0717640645580633

One thing more is worth knowing that according to Ayurveda if there can be damage of 6 levels inside of the cells like - Save collect , Prasar spread , outbreak infection of cells , dwelling place space loss , individual cell damage , differentiate change in the identity of the cell.	2.3535957914504437

When the activity of battering starts happening in the cells then its nucleus or DNA as if starts experiencing this that its identity will not be preserved.	2.980056172821309

During this the nucleus catches the tempo of multiplying many times by dividing itself and forgets the instructions of the commander styled brain.	2.2303580496986317

Here the meaning of the instruction of the commander of the brain is that instrument or apparatus under which so far it was driven.	2.8736347195685914

Like in the body if generally some part gets injured then the cells and tissues there give their full contribution according to the formation of that place.	3.3531312207848525

But when the cells become rampant then they become not favourable of the body but unfavourable.	3.8012132115408703

Medicine in Lavanya Ayurvedic Hospital and Research Centre happens according to Yukti vyapakshya , Devopakshya and Satvavajay through Ayurveda.	2.246417030225379

The prior work or preparations of Panchakarma are - Pachan Digestion , Snehan Lubrication and Swedan.	2.436783874006725

After this under the activity of purification are Vamana , Virechana , Vasti , Nasya and Raktamoshana.	2.864397141387498

Under purification medicine the most important thing is this that the possibility of common diseases occurring a second time finishes.	3.9635515142359816

By Panchakarma the three dosha of Vata , Pitta and Kafa go away.	3.1317310650873575

In other words with Panchakarma the entire body becomes detoxified or free of toxins.	3.082484587452555

All cells of the body become pure and clean.	7.410357238433545

Because cancer is a difficult disease , that is why its treatment is not possible with only plants and herbs.	4.056589027790602

For this one has to take the help of chemotherapy.	7.985194548872845

If the disease is outside then its miasma can be removed by the use of the medicines on the particular place of the body.	4.037892613263151

But if this is inside the body then in this condition the use of medicines applied on that particular place would not have been possible.	4.250212498892738

Therefore in these matters treatment is possible only by the medicines taken through the mouth.	4.717335431944004

Here also if the miasma of the ulcer is in the beginning stage then success is achieved and if the part of the body with the ulcer has melted and finished then till what extent will success be achieved , this can not be said from before.	2.9099306890288843

But it becomes essential to cut and remove that rotten part of the body but in this condition also the tendency in the cancerous cells to increase itself somehow with uncontrolled and fast speed has been finished from before.	2.538791511278425

After having given radiotherapy and chemotherapy many times also the cells which were still being a challenge to medicine the activity of their proliferation stops.	2.483703190268179

Therefore this is a matter of happiness that in these matters also success is fully possible.	3.328635043865505

This way a campaign is going on in Lavanya to finish cancer from the root.	3.223573214251585

For children and teenagers obesity has been considered a big matter that is why for saving them from obesity some parents and children themselves too keep their footsteps carefully.	2.499331746540697

In these important precautions is also included not letting them drink too much fruit juice.	2.9578219362937426

It is considered that not letting them drink fruit juice is also included.	3.659091107086562

It is considered that fatness increases due to fruit juice.	3.830416778042578

But recently this matter has come forward by a study that if the fruit juice is hundred percent pure and sugar is not mixed in it then that does not become a reason for fatness.	3.3734439146463466

This study was presented in the meeting of the paediatric society happening in Toronto of Canada.	2.480660028483058

This is quite an important study , because it has been ascertained by this that there is no danger of fatness by pure juice and it can be taken in appropriate amount.	3.7263133262644104

But in relation to drinking this juice some things have to be kept in mind.	3.967518627153487

Like this that the canned juice you take from the market should be 100 percent pure juice of fruit.	3.269459962438577

If other nutritious elements are mixed in it then also it is important to keep this information that there should not have been any negative effect on the quality of its fruit.	3.933618027804756

Then drink such juices more in which there is enough juice because there is less necessity to mix other elements like - juice of orange.	3.4528279120760907

If in the place of the juice of orange you take the juice of apple then know that hundred percent purity of this juice is not possible.	4.055631267553492

Remove stretch marks like this.	7.113821089850928

When you are pregnant , then massage on tummy , hips , breast and legs with cocoa butter.	2.902387436883721

Apart from this , you can also put the paste of sandalwood during this time.	4.054546940054149

This is very beneficial.	10.245640348522107

Make a paste of the leaves of aloe vera and apply this on the skin.	4.0200072404724185

By this stretch marks will not come up on your skin.	3.5994805914256007

By mixing Calendula oil and wheat germ oil and applying on stretch marks also gives benefit.	3.029202562974119

However , diet also has an important role with pregnancy.	5.357382475432303

Drink maximum water everyday.	9.071642775698766

By this the pores of your skin may open and your skin will look fresh.	3.5294577478364046

Keep your diet balanced and definitely take vitamin A , E and C.	3.5978858826520344

You also take fruits and vegetables , fish liver oil , almond , egg and beans etc in appropriate amount.	3.1452246058834947

If vitamins and proteins are included in your diet , then your skin will also remain fresh.	3.970222636018581

When you notice the difference in your skin , then you begin massage of olive oil on your skin.	3.1263681976091653

However , you can also massage with almond oil , castor oil , avocado oil and vitamin E oil.	3.4382396755494966

For removing the blackness of the neck make a paste of flour of corn , powder of sandalwood , flour of bran , two spoons juice of lemon and curd.	2.7044448738524647

Apply this on the neck and leave for 10 to 15 minutes.	5.1858668524777345

When it dries lightly , then scrub with light hands and clean.	3.4755291030801887

By doing this everyday the blackness will go.	4.154336359890463

Scientists have for the first time known this secret that during an illness or cut on being sick how the cells do the work of restoration.	2.5070512646511567

In the future by this study new areas of techniques of breathing life into dead cells will be found.	2.5649020692253854

The doctors of Rhode Island hospital have discovered microscopic particles named micro vesicles.	2.6140370756754434

In these messenger RNA are hidden.	5.16545807657353

Complete it.	7.174776245932901

The cells present in that bone marrow soak these micro vesicles.	3.3395069296622264

Later they do the creation of new cells.	4.8666342085813925

A matter of surprise is this that scientists know about microvesciles since the last 40 years , but no one looked at their role.	2.847509727660098

Now Eliota says , ' Actually this is a major information bearer , which does the work of reaching information between the cells.'.	3.220345311941292

Eliota has said that micro vesicles are so effective that new cells built by their medium can take the place of sick cells in the body permanently.	3.3158528870635684

Aorta artery begins from the chest goes to the lower part in the stomach and its branches reach blood in the lower reaches and the legs too.	4.306299178755138

Disorders happening in this can prove fatal , but advancement happening in medical knowledge can defeat this disease.	2.6618969474880028

Sometimes with advancing age or atherosclerosis hardness of arteries or because of high blood pressure some part of the aorta gets weak and that starts spreading towards the outside.	3.207288777270389

This spread keeps increasing with time and the wall of the aorta keeps getting thin stretches and bloats up like a balloon.	2.9403280323314176

In this situation the aorta can burst by which the death of the patient occurs.	4.742778044944148

This condition of the aorta is called Aneurysm.	6.576584234922503

If it is in the part of the chest then this is called aorta Aneurysm and if in the stomach then it is called abdominal aortic Aneurysm.	4.5590720264037605

In most patients no symptoms occur.	5.7724217072706825

In some patients of Thoracic Aorta Aneurysm there can be pain in the chest , difficulty in breathing , having pain in swallowing and congestion in coughing.	3.320606266615638

In those patients of abdominal aortic Aneurysm where the symptoms occur , in those major are pain happening in stomach , chest or back.	2.8959947171094047

If the aneurysm is small then on intervals of some days one has to take medical prescription on checking and has to keep the blood pressure in balance.	3.4459774865636805

If the doctor feels that there is a danger of the aneurysm bursting , then any one of these treatments can be executed in these two types.	3.1278976752586924

By putting a cut on the stomach or chest the aneurysm part of the aorta can be cut and a pipe is sewn in its place.	3.372085607054892

In this surgical repairing the danger to the life of the patient is 10 %.	5.345900298725833

In endovascular repair without an operation being done a stat graph is put on the aorta from the inside and it is repaired.	3.039319959279142

In this process there is no need to make the patient unconscious and neither to give blood.	3.9209473780289215

I have made more than 100 patients alright by this method.	3.721800899819879

In this method the patient goes home the next day itself without any complexity.	3.512295296745142

Pregnant women and children should escape from the smoke of cigarettes.	4.687990244886732

The bedroom of the child should be kept free of the kitchen and pesticides.	5.714948079480385

Save the children from dust.	8.066041260712945

Through a recent research its revealed that if you are old and its in your habit to exercise , then your knees can have problems.	2.8442804010355376

Also you tend to have more probability of having arthritis.	3.53376226033583

In this regard Christoph Statling associated with the University of California situated in San Francisco and the head of this study has to say that those figures which we have got in the study , indicate that those who do more of physical work , the danger of unevenness occuring in their knees is more.	2.8976150525743436

Also the danger of osteoarthritis occuring is more.	6.646796648242046

Osteoarthritis is that degenerative disease of the joints , in which there is constant pain , swelling and rigidness in the joints.	4.219168068748532

As a result , his moving around is hampered.	3.6651218498260185

Lakhs of people around the world are suffering from this problem.	5.248234040991152

Accordind to a new research done in Sweden , those men who are unable to express their anger because of bad behavior with them in the office , the chances of them having a heart attack doubles.	3.03608342923525

To reach to this result the researchers estimated 2,775 such men in Stockholm , who have never had an heart attack.	2.51716315130499

These employees were asked how do they tackle the job related frustation ? 	2.8506247732819037

They express their anger or bear quietly ? 	5.143333763878605

After the angst do they start haveing headaches or stomach aches ? 	3.0172155502286455

Do they take out their work place frustation in home ? 	3.7098039648810532

These employees were also asked about their drug habits - like intake of alcohol and smoking , education , disease especially diabetes , work pressure etc.	2.231886611484865

Besides this the blood pressure , body mass index and cholestrol level of the people involved were also taken.	3.6987074714425843

The average age of all the people involved in the study was 41 years , when this study was started between 1992 to 1995.	3.3597648131872804

The result of the study carried on till 2003 was that those men who were efficient in handling the pressure , compared to those men who beared up with their frustation had almost double the chances of dying due to heart attack or some heart problem.	2.357431820890993

Not just narcotic drugs like cocaine , LSD , heroine adversely effect the brain , but the steroids having corticosteroids like prednisone , dexamethasone and hydrocortisone used to treat the disorders like asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , skin diseases and allergy also effect the brain adversely.	1.9579818767975936

Result , the people taking the medicine can have decision making problems.	3.886131623593282

These can include - concentration problems , decreased activeness , not being able to remember the spoken words , not being able to register a thing or an incident for a long time in the memory.	2.766953439751174

The good thing is that after closing the intake of the medicines having corticosteroids the effect of many sideeffects reduces gradually.	3.5783130004466406

Infact the effect of the above medicines can completely stop.	5.450554305982834

After closing the corticosteroids therapy of most of the healthy patients there memory became like it was earlier that is it became normal.	2.7683964417640143

Fonterra and the University of Auckland has prepared such an amazing icecream , which has the quality of combating the side effects of the uncomfortable chemotherapy used as a treatment of the cancer patients.	3.1617117340115306

What is the effect of this ice cream named as ' recharge ' on the diarrhea and anemia caused due to the chemotherapy , to know it the second stage experiments is being done in New zealand currently.	2.875530313717476

Till now this much has been understood that this icecream along with curtailing the process of weight loss due to chemotherapy also reduces the damage happening to the immune system.	2.5106842436522046

Till now the health experts knew this itself that during the treatment your body tend to absorb the medicine profusely with the intake of the juice of grapefruit , but the University of Western Ontario has claims that you should not take the juice of orange , apple or any other juice , because juice hampers the medicine to get absorbed completely.	2.6675608128054695

According to the head of the study David G Belli the safest way to take medicine is water itself.	3.0284837024915023

The couple busy in the work and family responsibilities can have sex only after eleven in the night , whearas the truth is that the level of testosterone is at its peak in the morning , and the quality of the sperms is best in the afternoon.	2.7590557046060984

And about the time for the females to get pregnant ,.	5.282393847628232

But the scientists are unable to understand till now whether in the case of successful concieving the time of the sex influences or not.	3.2753196635354622

The delicious breakfast done in the morning provides you with energy all day , also it curtails your habit of eating more.	3.408203774100651

Actually our hunger is satisfied more with the morning diet as compared to the evening diet.	3.3651120020245875

If we believe some of the studies then in the people getting up at the wee hours and early morning the attention , focus , vigilence and philosophical power is at its peak in the afternoon.	2.4491268346321293

Hence the works requiring a lot of mental consideration , do them in the morning and save the lighter works for the evening.	3.3154962038631597

Although the mind of the youth remains sharp in the afternoon.	4.506476761333465

If you have certain teeth problem and you need to go to the doctor then take the time of only after the lunch.	3.6001406586861435

First at this time the sensation of pain is less , second the effect of the anesthesia remains till long.	3.782419739655302

When the talk comes to the time of exercise , then do you also understand that the morning time is the best and the evening time is the worst for exercising ? 	3.0309487486379747

If yes , then think again.	6.1264786927870984

The studies have revealed this that the people participating in sports perform better in the afternoons or in the evenings , because that time the temperature of your body remains high , there is more strength in the muscles , there is flexibility in the joints , the respiratory tracts are open and the heart too is performing its functions effectively.	2.6287397437747346

Towards the end of the day where the athletes are capable of the run , there even the swimmers swim with a comparatively fast speed during this time and the football players too give better performance during this time.	2.402497841137935

In case you want to burn more calories then do know this fact that the burning of calories is related not to the time , but to your physical constitution and metabolism.	2.7420546878400267

Muscles burn more calories as compared to fat.	5.763592098377783

Your body temperature can have a variation of 4 degree farenheit , because the body temperature is 96 degree in the morning , which can go up till after the noon and rise to 100 degree.	2.679197402704735

Actually the temperature of your body affects everything ranging from your reaction to balance.	3.461877700503425

Medicines too should be taken on time just like the diet.	5.09938386015247

As an example the medicine of allergy works better when taken before going to bed.	3.5030559994326382

With this you will get relief from the prominent symptoms of fever in the morning , like sneezing , running nose , itching in the eyes and lack of sleep.	4.094748406389955

Likewise if you take the pill of aspirin in the evening there would be a reduction in the stomach related problems.	4.447618559568704

Do you have to complete some work in the afternoon ? 	5.2749655483587

Have to give a dinner party in the evening or participate in a race in the evening ? 	3.359660028223512

If yes , then take a nap from one a clock till three in the afternoon , when your body temperature drops then the vigilence starts to.	2.537526881005425

A little nap at this time will improve your mood , vigilence and memory.	3.2210840960003586

This is said by of Sir Mednick PHD , who is a psycholgist in San Diego , University of California.	2.485252255575391

According to him with this your productivity will ofcourse increase , you will also have menal and physical swiftness.	2.660591496725551

Coming to the question of the duration of the nap then that depends on what do you have to do.	3.5392897695971226

Although delivery is not in your hands , but its important to know that during night the delivery pain is more.	3.3851306602882443

Till now just this was said about cancer that it is like that charged arrow of the quiver , which can not be reverted back.	3.106738899388209

That means if it happens once , it would continue to grow.	3.320344187489944

But the figures which have been collected for over two decades by the American Medical Association after screening the breast and prostrate cancer , they have raised questionary status on the earlier assumptions.	2.194303171986388

It was obviously seen in the study that tumor if not treated can become life threatening , but this thing came up too that the smaller tumors of the cancers even when they were not treated were not visible after some time during the screening or their development stopped on their own meaning they shrunked.	2.3964369844622517

In some cases of breast cancer it has even been observed that the tumors disappear automatically.	3.251231198402233

The earlier perception concerning cancer was this itself that it is a long procedure , in this first the mutation starts in one of the cells that is alterations starts coming in its composition and function.	3.1870680930780724

Then bit by bit it further goes on mutatingt and the mutation can never be reverted to the earlier normal state.	2.3388075055891484

The image of cancer is like an arrow , which goes on running to only one direction.	3.5100594276107038

For cancer to flourish the suitability of other things is also essential besides mutation.	3.0682547720148

Those mutation cells require the support of their surrounding cells.	4.012338463932567

Cancer is fast occuring procedure.	6.732512600089496

The tumors of the testicles disappear.	6.74925655198594

Dr.Jognathan of the John Hopkins says that this does not happen usually , but this does happen.	3.167084333400619

It could be , that there is some knot in the testicles of some young man , but as soon as the doctors take out his testicles , only a mark of tumor is found there or else the tumor totally shrunk and became tiny.	2.495396428451972

In 95 percent of the cases this itself has been observed that after taking out the testicles the tumor disappears with passing time.	3.1721649493990625

Or else if there is some big tumor visible near the kidney of some young man , then the doctors assume this itself that it erupted somewhere else , hence they try to locate it first.	2.446995786711701

In this process they find a big mark on the testicles of that man , which is the only evidence of the original cancer.	2.882630053861998

There they get no tumor.	6.8844188687384555

Generally the cancer of the testicles does not happen and other cancers mostly do not disappear , but now the evidence of this are constantly being found that cancer can return or else terminate.	2.494815973894828

Hence now the researchers are being pressurized that the earlier cancer related assumptions , they test them again and try to undersatnd what cancer actually is and how does its development takes place.	2.0396841910036008

Surely generally cancer does not disappear and nobody is giving this advise that on the basis of these few incidents the cancer patients stop getting their treatment.	2.5579640508330406

It is rarely seen that cancer would give the patient leniency after taking a serious stage.	2.9083835290761018

But after knowing how cancer develops and how it sometimes disappears , it would definitely help the doctor to decide which tumor should be left like that and which should be treated.	2.3211384016609724

In most of the cases the doctors were not able to decide this thing.	4.265795194592645

The cells with cancer and those cells which would be converting into cancer cell , those are umpteen in every middle aged or old aged person.	2.345074989077291

This fact was known after the autopsy of those people , whose death took place due to other reasons and they did n't know before dying that they had cancer cells or the cells due to convert into cancer cells in future that are the pre cancerous cells.	2.1017425731710238

They did n't even have the complaint of any big tumor nor were there symptoms of cancer.	3.4388197258456534

Here this question is n't interesting that why do we have cancer , but this question is interesting that despite us having the cells that convert into cancer cells in the future why do n't we get cancer ? 	2.65267783494424

According to the researchers a simple cell approaching to convert into a cancer cell , its possible that it becomes normal again.	2.5260469366159963

Understand it this way - those cells which are proceeding to produce cervical cancer , they all of a sudden revert back to the normal condition.	2.6630399774548508

In one of the studies it was known by doing a pep test that 60 percent of the pre cancerous cervical cells became normal within a year , whereas 90 percent of such cells took three years to become normal.	2.3793189282438694

Today there is a talk of the rapidly spreading cancer , because with screening the cases of breast and prostrate cancer can be known in huge numbers in the early stage itself.	3.158219177241349

Due to lack of screening this was n't there earlier.	3.5846879517874712

Now if it is believed that it is necessary for the early stage cancer patients to have a serious condition , then the number of the early stage patients after the screening should be equal to the number of the serious stage patients.	3.5141592091055283

But this thing is n't observed in the screening of breast and prostrate cancer.	3.2067409173800607

Hence people believe that many of the first stage cancers do not disappear.	4.941408346211403

Yes , some oblique evidences of the disappearance of breast cancer have been found.	4.1117036985832796

But to say regarding the disappearance of prostrate cancer is difficult.	3.784863341760047

The researchers say that they doubt the concept that this cancer disappears.	3.0145457938406404

But they do say this much that many cancers terminate after thriving in the body or their development happens way too slowly.	3.010130850797128

This thing has come up in many studies.	5.473073898320963

Here the number of people getting blind due to cataract itself is 20 lakhs and for around 25 lakhs of eyes cornea transplant is required.	2.7692031999980036

But the dismaying thing is that such amount of cornea is not available in the country.	4.487338240188615

In our country most of the cases of blindness are in Jammu and Kashmir , Maharastra , Tamil Nadu , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan , Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.	2.3687404119177473

The percentage of the problems related to the eyes in kids due to the deficiency of vitamin ' A ' is also a lot in India.	4.996480859419412

Because of this every year many thousands of kids tend to become the victims of untimely blindness.	2.943501892735446

55 percent of the total patients of cataract become blind due to the lack of proper treatment on proper time.	3.7988334491326414

Similarly 20 percent of the patients are forced to become blind due to an eye infection named tracoma.	4.235231135150646

Besides this people lose their vision due to the reasons such as injury , malnutrition and diabetes.	3.5298853959155805

Today an effort is essential to make even the common people aware regarding the eyes and its ailments.	3.4056911723800942

Under this itself here an account of the causes , symptoms and medication of all the eye problems is present.	2.947111186519155

In Myopia or nearsightedness the rays coming from far away or a great distance instead of focussing on the retina or vision plate , focus on its front.	2.1395285899135543

According to the functions its of three types.	3.9108014249381693

When the lens is removed with an operation , the eyes gets hypermetropic.	3.3887690600850635

In such cases due to a high amount of defect a very powerful lens has to be placed.	3.2934217723550674

Due to hypermetropia the adjustment ability of the eye is affected.	4.548284455629148

In this defect the eyes tend to adjust to an extent , but with this the adjustment muscles weakens.	3.0677656015320163

Due to the pressure in the eye there is headache and the nearby letters starts looking blurred.	3.578825952871284

Astigmatismo - this is a special kind of vision defect , in which the.	7.002589704671681

Besides the above mentioned three types of vision disorders there is one more disorder presbyopia.	4.017078418740114

This happens due to the adjustment ability problems in the eyes occuring after the age of forty years.	4.732114144593471

In this the lens is unable to get the required convexity due to the reduction of the flexiblity of the lens , because of which the person can not see clearly.	4.12801447307709

Its common to have backaches in females.	4.831191558338781

Most of the women have backache problem also due to wearing of high heel sandels and slippers.	3.3332769391015034

According to a survey every year around one crore females have backache problems.	2.753529285170925

As compared to the men women suffer more with backache problems.	4.281754411383929

Biological reasons are more responsible for backaches in females.	3.6614426383319083

In order to show their body beautiful and slim due to increasing fashion in the modern world the educated female often wears high heel footwear , which is dangerous for the delicate waist.	2.3354354127311487

Those women who have completed forty years and whose menses are irregular , they have the problem of osteoporosis due to shortage of calcium in the body because of the deficiency of estrogen harmone , because of which they get the problem of backaches.	3.3749328021478138

During pregnancy 40 to 60 percent females have backaches.	4.743003613756744

During mensus its common for the females to have backaches.	3.721293772607198

If a women gets outs the uterus due to fibroid then she usually has the problem of backache.	2.904569566709949

If in some accident the female hurts her spine then usually she has backache problems.	2.590846819596083

Besides this wearing very tight clothes to look fit and slim , picking up heavy weight stuff , excessive fat in the females becomes the cause of backaches in females.	2.6002760011657013

The bone specialist of the Saharanpur district hospital Dr.Ashok Aggarwal informs that due to wearing high heel sandels and slippers the balance of the backbone gets disturbed , because of which pressure in the waist nerves increases and the females get backache problems.	2.53458507563901

Besides this during cold backaches occur due to rigidness in the muscles.	4.424067713414288

Wrong standing ad sitting postures , wrong sleeping manner , the habit of sleeping in thick soft beds , not to keep the body in motion , mental stress etc are such reasons due to which the problem of backache occur.	3.047494559648828

Congenital deformaties like tumor in the spine and spina bifida or spondylosis injury in the spine , disk dislocation , tuberculosis etc are the other causes of backaches.	2.9264158947786747

According to yogic science the rigidness occuring in the spine is the cause of backaches.	3.678408537428633

With the practice of the different activities of yoga the rigidness of the spine is finished , which comforts the backaches.	2.7648259463801876

Due to yogic asanas the backbone strengthens and the rigidness goes away.	2.9881305033362486

Regarding the problem of the legs Dr.M K Gupta informs that swelling in the legs , excessive pain , muscle pull etc are such problems which are not seriously taken by the people.	3.200872721013373

People think that this is happening due to tiredness.	5.947271025498416

But every time the cause of the problem is not tiredness.	6.53948862812038

This pain is a warning signal hence the docter should be contacted immediately when such pain erupts.	2.8338067111349194

He tells that this is a leg ailment , ' Filariasis ' that is fil leg which is also called as elephant leg.	3.4777165591282837

This disease happens because of a thread like parasite.	5.352376901493528

There are nine species of this parasite found in mosquitoes.	3.3956632947774676

Different species are capable of aiming different parts of the body.	3.9342949901648465

Due to mosquito bite this parasite reaches human blood.	3.538451295129575

Vaucheria bancrofti parasite is found in the lymph vessels and it spreads lymphatic filariasis.	4.091484731609072

With its fast transition the elephant leg disease occurs.	3.5708169167111112

In this disease the leg of the patient swells a lot and looks absolutely abnormal.	4.191600860817208

This disease can be prevented if treated on time otherwise if delayed it can become incurable.	3.3926516946270815

Many a times the patient dies due to this.	5.649154308097643

Knowing the importance of the legs beauty experts take special care of this.	4.400376313605895

The art of grooming the legs is called pedicure.	3.7310278416106635

Do you have problems getting up from the bed in the morning or you feel like taking a nap for a while keeping the head on the desk after lunch ? 	3.2930498719735914

If this is happening with you too , then you are not the only one facing this problem.	3.7677815006112096

In the busy life of today we are unable to take sound and proper sleep.	4.186274909589423

Complete it.	7.174776245932901

Due to busy schedule and lack of sleep one gets tired.	4.069095236082555

Besides this , not taking a proper diet is also one of the reasons of tiredness.	4.679972453943598

Those people who are always tired , they become the victims of such problems.	3.546784326849

A person also gets tired before dehydration.	4.974248014178721

The ability of females to eat junk food is also low as compared to males and males do not have much trouble having these things.	2.9888482893450266

The idea of female weakness can be had from this thing itself that during periods there is lack of iron amongst 20 to 80 percent of females.	2.825461616536076

Although they do not have the lack of blood , but they keep exhausted , can not think much , they do not get sleep properly and they get cough and cold easily too.	3.690061369118448

Not only this , the problem of thyroid is more in females.	6.620871534259144

Then the females start worrying on small issues , whereas the males ignore the symptoms until they get problematic.	2.386988072939366

If we think from a spiritual point of view , then whatever we think a lot , we start feeling that way itself.	2.5813405023077847

The thing which we donot think about , we do n't even feel about that.	3.17378487059

Hence we should think staying in our limits and should follow this schedule itself.	2.7807126477697524

Firstly you should definitely take breakfast , then whether you are hungery or not.	3.3779860554776993

Always keep your food with yourself and include the required amount of proteins and vitamins in it.	2.990293464500367

Do not delay drinking water after the break of the day.	4.147618309822912

Do try that you get the right amount of iron in the day.	5.55556670018027

If you are fond of having sweets , then try to function having fruits instead of sweets.	2.543815397697182

Increase the quantity of fiber reducing the quantity of fat in your food.	5.738512412739138

Eat the food three hour before going to bed.	4.433386167685782

After having a coffee in the day do not take more coffee , because it affects the sleep and induces tiredness.	3.3161815918182604

Do exercise daily , then whether it 's only a walk and it is also necessary to escape depression.	3.6160995688088304

Despite this , the most important thing is that you should know what is your body demanding at what point of time and what is it trying to tell you.	3.310666971408188

Get up and go somewhere to roam.	4.828982339736707

Recollect your energy by sitting in the sun.	6.380278438047129

Do Tai Chi , you will get a lot of energy through this.	5.43350245982248

Besides this , music too is a good option to rejuvenate the energy.	3.878719757696052
